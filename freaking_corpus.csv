0,5.0,No close captions! No subtilies! pissing me off still.. end up gave that dvd to my mom. I love this movie.. I remember when I saw it on television once... man! freaking pissing me off when found out has no captions!
1,4.0,"IDLE HANDS is a movie that I remember always being on the USA Network when I was really young, and I remember it was a sick movie. It still is, but now older (but not wiser), I see this movie for how it should be seen: a twisted little gem that turns the Dawson's Creek world inside out. Yes, SCREAM did it too, but for some reason, the way IDLE HANDS shows us a guy that loves the girl next door and has two dumb buddies like every bad teen movie ever makes the fact that the movie is about a stoner that kills his parents and best friends (who come back as freaking zombies) with his possessed right hand (hi, Ash) so much sweeter. Yes, maybe I'm reading too much into it, but this movie really is underrated in my opinion. It has great music (especially The Offspring's version of The Ramones' I WANNA BE SEDATED), a clever script, great performances (especially by Seth Green & Elden Henson as the zombified buddies Mick and Pnub, who didn't walk up the stairway to Heaven because ""it was too far""), and sly direction by Rodman Flender, who has done TALES FROM THE CRYPT episodes, which at times this movie shares its tone with. Overall, IDLE HANDS is great for horror fans that like their horror with a wink and a nod, and it even throws in some unnecessary nudity, just like the good ol' days."
2,4.0,"Wow! I can't recall the last time I saw so many heated reviews.

I saw this movie awhile back so I'm a rusty review. Pardon me if I miss a few fine points but I can't watch it again. It's just too painful. When I saw it I saw my teenage life in a movie and wanted to just run out of the room. I didn't grow up in SLC but I did get transplanted from a large city into a small Midwest town with a fringe 'punk' scene during the second or third wave of punk. This movie is such a freaking history lesson because it describes a time when there was no Hot Topic (i.e. Punk was subculture and had no real money cashing in on it) and punk was a mostly unwanted subculture. If you looked like these kids during this time period you WERE the enemy, no matter how true your Anarchist morals might be. Just listening to the Dead Kennedy's in public was an act of Communism. See how I didn't say 'act of terrorism' there? Middle East terrorism was a thing of the late 70's so the hatred was against Communism. If you were anti-Reagan and said something as simple as 'what's so bad about collective farming?' in the mid 80's you were likely to evoke some hostility.

And so many look back at the time with the lens of the internet and Wikipedia misguiding their view. You must understand that if punk (a very small and unpopular music genre) came to your town it was through import. Either a friend from a big city brought it or some lone independent record store carried it along with a few odd albums from the 70's, like Zappa, that you'd never heard or cared about. And that was all you got. You couldn't hyperlink from Johnny Rotten to Anarchy and try to figure out what that rally meant. You just saw pictures of the Sex Pistols pissing everyone off and thought, 'yeah, that sounds about right'. Punk was your shield. You may not have understood all it's underlying philosophy (like there's actually one they can all agree to) but you understood the reaction, and that was enough.

Now here's the next kicker that strikes me as a little funny. It's odd that people can't fathom two people can experience the same phenomenon differently or have a different take on it. Being a punk in say NYC 77 would have been much different than being one in 86 insert small Midwest town, '81 Manchester England or '82 Los Angeles. This movie can't capture every 'punk' experience or perspective everyone had and it shouldn't. What it does well is describe the isolation, outcast and sometimes bizarre lifestyle proclaiming yourself a 'punk' might put you into. The scene with the drug dealer where he's shooting the car hoping to sink it in Great Salt Lake wasn't exactly my personal experience but it wasn't too far from the 'anything could happen so watch out' feeling I had when I proclaimed myself a 'punk'.

I knew someone like every single character in the movie during my 'punk' phase, and while I didn't become a lawyer I did look back on it all as an absurd but necessary coming of age transition set to a very angry soundtrack (my personal soundtrack had Husker Du's 'Zen Arcade', Black Flags 'Who's Got the 10 1/2' and DK's 'Fresh Fruit' playing most of the time). Again, ALL of this was too insane to live one time around and watch a second time around.

What really struck me as profound is Steve-O's girlfriend who points out how punk is just another uniform. Maybe the movement didn't start out that way but we all know that's all it became. It pains me to see what my friends and I used to call 'safety hawks' sported by people trying to look trendy just as much as it pains me to see motorcycle guys riding around wearing Harley gear. It's too cliche' to have any meaning or impact any more. When punk got corporate sponsorship a'la Hot Topic it said it's final death knell. It sounded kind of like this: ghhgghgghgghhh! Ghaaahhhh. Gehhhhehhgggh! (cough, cough, roll on the floor dramatically).

Was Steve-O a poseur? God, how we threw that term around way back when. Well, how punk is 'punk'? What is punk? Is it the crybaby Clash of 'Sandanista' bleeding a left-leaning heart out for some idiotic third world problem I have no clue about or is it the thrash of Greg Ginn's guitar solo against a sea of seemingly mediocre music? Do you have to run for office as a joke, like Biafra, and keep up this anti-right atitude for life no matter how annoying (again, Biafra), or do you have to keep your hate face on like Rollins? Or were you no longer punk if you weren't hanging with the CBGB crowd in the mid-70's? What if you weren't in a band? And what about those God-Awful skaters that would hang around like  flies on punk's rotten corpse, are they punk? Is it all about fighting authority? What if you become an authority on fighting authority?

Lux Interior (the Cramps) would tell Steve-O, and you for that matter, 'You ain't no punk, YOU PUNK!' After throwing away enough of my life to some silly movement that expressed my anger quite vividly I'd say Steve-O was  just as punk as anything else that came down the pike. I'm just glad he had the sense to move on and not let an art fad become his life. That's right hanger on-er's. Punk was just one big art fad. Time to let go and find something else or find nothing at all.

Great movie, F-You."
3,2.0,"Saw Resident Evil 2. Without going into FULL detail, allow me to say this:

What a LOAD!

Tell you what, if you liked the first movie, then watch this only if you want an excuse to create a big budget, blow-every-flipping-thing-up, bridge to another possible sequel.

I swear, Paul Anderson is films version of Piers Anthony (sp?). He doesn't know how to end a movie, so he stops them all on some freaking Joss Weadon cliffhanger.

Y'know Paul, sometimes we WANT endings to our films. We want to be able to have that last sigh of relief when a film ends. We want to feel like something is concluded. We DON'T all want to be left hanging at the end of everyone of your films. Every once and a while is fine, but not EVERY movie. That kind of crap makes me wary of wanting to see the future releases of Driver and Necropolis. Heck, if he WANTED a cliffhanger, he could have stopped the movie 5 minutes from where it did end and I would have been less irritated.

The ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a blazing flurry of F-Words.

It is with that word and the pointless topless scenes that I think garnered the ""R"" rating, which is pretty flipping sad.

All the characters were stale and you began to not really care if one guy lived or died. When the characters did die, there wasn't ever that feeling of ""Aw, man, I really liked him/her too"".

Now, I KNOW the Resident Evil series isn't all about zombies. It's not a plain zombie story, sure, but they sure as hell have a lot to do with it. It played a lot into the first movie. THEY were it. THEY were the baddies, while sharing the light with the ONE Licker and the amnesia filled dude with the attitude.

The zombies this round are filler in the film. The movie just seems to flash back at them, as if to say ""Oh yeah, they're here too"". The Licker was even downplayed as a minimal threat to the people who had guns. In the first, it ransacked everything in sight and began evolving and becoming badder. This time, there's like TEN of them. You're thinking, ""Holy crap, they're screwed"".

Not necessarily so, Lois.

Instead, one guy gets offed and the rest are either shot, run over, blowed up or Crushed By Christ(TM).

Naturally, our heroes trip into a graveyard all filled with fog (that only seems to be THERE) and one of our ""Zombie Reminders"" shine as a bunch of dudes pop from the ground and start dancing around with Michael Jackson to bring in the long awaited Thriller 2: Zombie Boogaloo.

Okay, maybe not, but it would make more sense as to why they arrived than the NON reason the movie gave.

Then there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were, more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.

All of this combined makes me want to see the possibility of a three as much as I want to fork over 7.50 to see a third Star Wars.

Very Little."
4,5.0,the visuals rock. it is very scary. the music is perfect for it. this is possibly the scariest movie ever made. i jumped many times.  it was better than i expected. i think  everyone should watch it plus michelle rodriguez is freaking hott.
5,4.0,"I think whoever put this DVD together hates the movie and wanted to torture us with a Fullscreen version just for yuks. All menu and DVD extras (including the 3 sing-alongs) show it in Widescreen but the main movie is in Fullscreen. Why? It's nuts.

Hey I don't know if this has been discussed over the years or not but Albert Finney's Daddy Warbucks voice is an impersonation of director John Huston's. It sounds just like him! Close your eyes during his dialog (especially near the beginning when he's more curmudgeon-like) and check it out.

Everything is great about this DVD except that freaking Fullscreen treatment. WHY DID THEY DO THAT ANYWAY???"
6,4.0,"When I was a teenager, I looked at the few infomercials stating the Monty Python series on VHS and DVD, I thought the series was just filler. But later, as I grew older, some of my relatives introduced me to one of its films--The Holy Grail. Through that hour-and-a-half I was laughing so hard at everything the movie represented. And as time wore, I was watching the TV series itself, and that show was actually a little better than what I expected.

Now appreciating the entire franchise itself, I managed to pick up the Holy Grail movie itself on a 2-disc Special Edition DVD for $14 at a locat Target store and I was freaking happy.

What exactly is the movie about? Well, this is the retelling of the story of King Arthur, his uniting with the Knights of the Round Table at Camelot, and of course, the search for the Holy Grail--all told in a British humor fashion. Pointless, you may say, but still funny as hell nonetheless. And what a funny crew of Knights of Camelot, too; we have: Arthur, King of the Britons, Sir Bedevere the Wise (I think), Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Gallahad the Pure, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot. When a new strategy was planned along the way though, the Knights split up and went seperate ways to find the Grail, and that's when the comedy ensues. You'll see Sir Robin meet a giant three-headed knight whose three heads bicker at each other; Sir Gallahad run into a castle filled with sex-driven maidens; Sir Lancelot try to rescue a princess locked in a castle only to find out it's really a wussy prince trying to escape from being forced by his father to marry someone in favor of the bride's landscape; and King Arthur and Sir Bedevere meet the Knights who say ""Ni!"" that order the two to find a shrubbery with their necks at stake. In addition you'll find the entire crew meet up a castle full of disrespectful French and a certain rabbit...

Now on to the DVD itself. The video quality here has been remastered, but not restored; the picture is still grainy and muddy, but the colors are bright and solid nonetheless. The audio  quality could've been better, though. Although we do get a Dolby Mono soundtrack, it's pretty muffled, just like in the VHS copy. The Dolby 5.1 track, though, is much clearer than the mono, but doesn't thump the entire house-a good track anyway.

As with the extras, there's plenty to keep you happy. The first disc contains two fun commentary tracks by the Pythonites themselves and a Pop-up video track for storyboard comparisons.
Also included are subtitles ""for people who don't like the film"". There's also an extra 24 seconds added in the film...

Disc Two carries the bulk of the extras. For starters, we have two fun featurettes: ""The Quest For the Holy Grail Locations"" where Terry Jones and Michael Palin show which landscapes were the entire movie shot; and ""How to use your Coconuts"", an interesting feature on how to carve your coconut to a point where you can start banging them to make a trotting horse sound.
Also there's an interesting newscast featurette called ""On Location with the Pythons"", where the BBC News crew talks to the Python crew about the making of the film. In addition you'll also get art and photo galleries, it's theatrical trailer, Three Sing-alongs from the film, and a few more pointless features for the Python fan.

In conclusion, I still like the film as much as the DVD treatment here. And I appreciate the show itself,too. So buy this film and enjoy this film...

YOU DAFFY ENGLISH...KUH-NIGGETS."
7,3.0,"Well, I saw the original first, which, eh, that one was okay too but this one was kind of a little less okay in some parts a little more okay in other parts. For one thing. Ugh, the acting was just really really bad.  It made the movie as a whole just look like a really really low budget old godzilla movie.  The script was just as bad.

However, like the godzilla movies, there's just something interesting about the plot that grabs you.  Now the original grudge done in japan ju-on would've been better but it was a little dragged out and well, i'm too used to american special effects. low budget america and low budget japan are two different things. low budget america means cartoon like computer graphics that glow off the screen and looks like a joke, and japan low budget is like, home video camera and planets hanging from little strings.  don't know how anime manages to rock so much with their graphics but i don't think their film industry's quite there yet.

anyway, so ju-on had too many random characters that all did their own thing and met up with the grudge. it was okay but kind of like reading a weekly comic book series with a new episode and adventure every week. so what america does is realize this and chop it up and cut out characters and shorten other characters parts to leave room for a main character and i'm left even more confused with the newer version than the original.

so now i'm complaining that ju-on dragged, and the grudge was a rushed chopped up piece of bad acted out liver with sarah michelle geller in it who really really disappointed me considering the fact that i know who she is and therefore i want to be impressed by a veteran actress and instead had to sit there thinking how old she was starting to look. that's bad. when i sit there just thinking that you're more wrinkled than you were in buffy that means you need to try harder.

however, this is why it gets three stars and not two or one. the japanese version didn't really go anywhere. it introduced the grudge concept. showed off the grudge concept. end. it just did it and that was it. the american version tried to tie it together a little and show why it happened and explained things in a more timely manner. basically like, lets unfold this mystery. this is the mystery building up. this is why. japan was kind of like. this is the grudge. growl. scare. roar. grudge. grrrr. end.

like i said. both movies kind of sucked. i liked it cause i like horror movies but ju-on impressed me more with the scary scenes even with the lesser special effects and comic book like pace and america kind of bored me in that way with the rushed chopped liver aspect. they just didn't reproduce the scary moments well enough and didn't come up with enough unique ones all on their own. but the end was a teeny tiny bit better in the american version. not the whole end. but the endish area was a little better. however, the bad part was america threw in a really cheap thing all of a sudden out of nowhere that america always does where the main character tries to be the hero whereas in the japanese version she was the victim only. end.

My whole point? good concept. done badly. japan's was better overall.  should've tried harder or not at all. could've been great i think. they had the right idea to try a remake just didn't give it their all. they should've taken full advantage of our special effects because that's really sad that the planets hanging from little strings in a video camera impressed me more than our own computer graphics.

i also liked and hated the fact that it was also in japan. for godsake's why don't you just use the same freaking movie set and actors for crying out loud. geez. can't you be a little creative?  not only are we gonna remake a movie almost word for word and image for image, lets make it in the exact same house, in the exact same city, in the exact same foreign language. its like, why'd you even bother with an american version if you're gonna make it in frickin japan. just so you could replace the main character for sarah michelle geller?  geez, all you really had to do was glue and paste then."
8,5.0,"SO I popped this one in, after having read a cursory blurb about it but not enough to remember why I had been interested in the first place. I'm sitting there, for the first half hour or so, wondering why I am even bothering. Ok, they are in South America, work for an oil company, big deal, what's the point.....then suddenly it starts getting good. And by good I mean expletive-deleted-in-a-chariot-driven-sidecar TENSE. When you have two trucks filled with explosive gas (and by explosive i mean, a tablespoon would wipe out your HOUSE) being driven by two sets of very foolish men over rutted, hilly, barely-there roads for the next hour and a half, you tell ME how easy it is to remember where you are. All you are doing is looking at that freaking screen. Wow. Most of us have been weened on violence and blood and tension since we could walk. And you might not believe me when I say you WILL be riveted. ""Oh, its OLD"" you cry. ""ITS IN BLACK AND WHITE!"" Shut up. Watch it. You will need an extra set of undies. Its brilliant, its mad, and it is merciless. And worth every minute of your time."
9,5.0,"This movie makes me CRY (like ugly cry) every freaking time.  Such a sweet movie.  It has become a Christmas classic in my family, and it is one that I have to watch every year."
10,5.0,This is one of my favorite animated movies. I remember watching this when I was a kid and just saw that it was on DVD the other day. I literally jumped up and started freaking out when I saw it. I have it on VHS but the tape is so old and the box is worn so when I saw it on DVD I instantly got it. This movie is great for all ages and no matter how many times you watch it you don't tire from it. The songs are fun and will make you sing along everytime you hear them. Another classic that remains one of my favs.
11,2.0,"A journalist and his friend go to Las Vegas to cover a race. They also go there on a ton of drugs. This film shows them in colorful Las Vegas freaking out at everything, while on the drugs. During the film we get to hear the protagonists comments on life in America.  It is very bizarre. Now bizarre can be good, but in this case its boring and not very interesting. The characters and story aren't good. You are just thrown in the drugged up world of these two guys, and it all appears very silly. I give this 2 stars, because I can see how some counter culture type people might like this. I hear the book is much better. Some parts are funny, but the rest of the film is nearly unwatchable. If you like psychedelic trips, this film is for you. As the 60s ended, so did the idea that drugs would bring freedom and enlightenment. All it brought were a lot of headaches.
ATTENTION: If you plan to buy this, I suggest you wait until January 28, 2003 when a Special Edition will be released with a ton of extra material, by Criterion Collection."
12,4.0,"I rented this DVD after catching the beginning of this movie on TV. Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe are a realistic couple - not overly attractive, they live in a gritty Chicago neighborhood and they like to party. During one party Kevin Bacon is hypnotized by his sister-in-law (played divinely by Illeana Douglas) and he starts seeing strange things. Quite convinced he is freaking out, he is haunted by the disturbing visions, until he finally embraces them and the pieces of the puzzle fall together and a neighborhood murder is solved. During the course of the film, it is also discovered his son has the gift.

This movie's best point is that it is scary without being gross-out gory, but the ending is kind of weird. The special features are decent enough and it holds up for repeated viewings."
13,5.0,"While Ridley Scott developed a Philip K. Dick work into a subtle and contemplative masterpiece, director Paul Verhoeven took a more action-packed and mind-bending approach with his film. Is it better? They're almost impossible to compare. Blade Runner is probably of more cultural and cinematic significance, but Total Recall certainly has the edge when it comes to the pure entertainment department. As soon as Arnie starts freaking out in that Rekall chair, the film's pace hardly slackens for the rest of its silly ride and the action is bloody good fun. Verhoeven was the perfect director for this kind of project, mostly because of his stylish yet trained camerawork. Some directors are made for action, others for drama. Paul isn't inept when it comes to drama, but it's obvious he's most comfortable and effective with a fast storyline. The role of Quaid/Hauser probably would have benefitted from a more refined actor than Schwarzenegger, who is only slightly above Tommy Wiseau in versatility; however, Arnold has a quality about him that makes not only the character he plays more memorable, but the film as a whole. He works well in zany, unbelievable scenarios, and this film is certainly in that jurisdiction. Total Recall has twists aplenty, thrilling action sequences, Arnie being Arnie, cool production design, and a mutant prostitute with three breasts. What more can an audience ask for?"
14,5.0,"There's no doubt in my mind that Arnold Schwarzeneggar is the greatest action star of all time. He's been in so many great movies, like True Lies, Predator, and, of course, the awesome Terminator movies, but one film of his that I find incredibly entertaining is the brilliant sci-fi flick Total Recall.

In the film, Arnold plays Douglas Quiad, a man who dreams of one day visiting Mars, which, in the future, is in a constant state of violence thanks to a group of rebels who demand cheaper air. Unable to convince his wife to vacation there, Doug goes to a place called `Total Recall', where he pays to have a memory of mars implanted into his brain, eliminating the necessity of going on an actual trip. As a bonus, he requests that the memory he receives will be of him as a secret agent, as opposed to an average joe.

As soon as the procedure begins, Doug starts freaking out on the technicians, who instantly put him back to sleep. While he's asleep, they inform us that his memory has been previously erased, and that they accidently brought it back to life. When Jack wakes up, once again unable to remember what happened, he is immediately thrown into a world of secret agents, as he's chased by a criminal all the way to Mars, where he realizes that his entire existence is an elaborate conspiracy, orchestrated by the evil air company.

The story is absolutely engrossing. There's action every step of the way, and the plot has more twists and turns than anything made by M. Night Shamamamalsnan. Even though on the outside it may seem like standard action fare, the film is loaded with thought-provoking materia. The ending, in particular, requires the viewer to decide for themselves what has happened.

For a film made in 1990, the special effects are absolutely incredible. Actually, the effects in this movie look much better than the lazy CGI that congests modern sci-fi movies (with a few exceptions, district 9 being one of them). The make-up effects are something to be proud of as well, especially the Kuato puppet, which looks hideous yet awesome at the same time. And, of course, there's the infamous lady with three boobs. The sets on Mars are impressive too, with the whole place coming across as a scummier version of Mos Eisley.

Total Recall is an incredible action film, an incredible sci-fi film, and an icredible film in general. It succeeds on every level, and it's entertaining as hell. It's best of it's kind, and I love it."

17,3.0,"Ya know, it's sad when a fun family film like this can be bogged down by worthless PC garbage. I never saw this movie in the theater, I almost didn't even rent it. Why? Because every review or shred of information I read pointed to the character designs. Junk like ""It's so wonderful to see an empowered female character who doesn't fit the barbie cookie-cutter design."" and utter non-sense like that. I figured, judging from what I'd heard, it was nothing but Disney PC garbage. I should have trusted Disney's sense more than that.
Look folks, it's simple. Lilo is slightly overweight and so are a few other characters in the movie. Other characters are very fit and lean. There's a wide mix and this is NOTHING new. This is NOT some kind of PC garbage, this is not woman empowerment, and this has NOTHING to do with the movie. It doesn't make them look ""real"", it doesn't change a freaking thing from any other movie. It's just one tiny little aspect that these lifeless morons decided they wanted make center stage. The characters and locations are wonderfully drawn and animated, and each have their own style.
This of course leads to senseless bashing of all the Disney women of the past. How low can people stoop. I've heard so much garbage now about how Ariel, Jasmine, and the rest are such awful role models for girls. Get a freakin life. Ariel is a MERMAID for crying out loud, and Jasmine's a princess. How can you think that the active, healthy women of Disney films would not LOOK healthy! It's mind numbing.
But, enough of that. Less than 15 minutes into the movie you'll realize this has all been blown so far out of proportion it's not funny, and forget all about it. Disney has put together a movie that's funny, action packed, and filled with great characters. Lilo is a bit of a brat, which is just plain hilarious. It's the only way a relationship between her and Stitch would be even slightly believable. Her older sister Nani is a little pointless, but fills the role none the less. Cobra Bubbles is a stretch to believe, but hey... why not. He's entertaining, and his voice booms loudly over the sub-woofer. It's just fun to hear him talk.
It's far from one of Disney's best, and it's largely forgettable. But hey, it's worth a rental and it's got some good laughs. You'll be hard pressed not to love Stitch no matter what you think of the movie. It's worth renting just to see him alone, but the movie itself should keep you entertained as well. It's not a classic, but it is fun hour and a half... and that's all I expected.

Just makes me roll an howl in laughter esp since he does it for first 10min then froget it for rest of movie then does it for last 2 minutes of film.

freaking awesome comedy

fight scenes are plentiful here and wanyanans doesnt ruin it at all and is kinda minimal in it"
19,5.0,"""Dirty"" Harry Callahan is one of those iconic characters that stands apart from the crowd. Who hasn't heard someone say, ""You've got to ask yourself one question: Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?""

And he certainly lives up to the legend in ""Dirty Harry,"" a grimy cop thriller where morals are grey and justice isn't always served by the law. Clint Eastwood gives a quietly menacing performance that dominates every scene he's in, and sets up the standard for world-weary cops who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty in pursuit of justice.

A serial killer referred to as ""Scorpio"" is killing people in San Francisco, and even sends a letter to the police demanding money. If he doesn't get his way, he's going to kill again. The man on the case is Detective ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan (Eastwood), who manages to thwart Scorpio's efforts to kill a Catholic priest. The serial killer is so enraged that he rapes and buries a young girl alive, and threatens the police with her death if they don't give in to his demands.

Harry is sent on a wild chase through San Francisco with a giant bag of money, and eventually is able to corner and stop the Scorpio killer (Andrew Robinson). Unfortunately for everybody, Harry's ruthless treatment of Scorpio leads to the killer being released -- and now he's determined to frame Harry as revenge. It's up to Harry to take the law into his own hands before Scorpio kills again.

""Dirty Harry"" actually has a very simple story, loosely based on the Zodiac killings in the 1970s. The really memorable part of the movie is the presentation -- this was a cop story where innocents frequently die, the killer walks free sometimes, and the ""hero"" isn't particularly heroic. There's nothing romanticized or tidy about Dirty Harry's world.

And a lot of that comes from Eastwood himself. His performance as Callahan is the stuff of cinematic legend -- he's an anti-hero with nerves like barbed wire and eyes like steel buttons, and he cares far more about justice than law. What matters most to him is saving innocent lives and stopping the killer, and sometimes he has to step outside the law to do so.

And while Eastwood starts off as a simple cop protagonist, his presence grows more imposing as the story winds on. This isn't hurt by the demonstrations of his badassery -- such as threatening a robber with the legendary ""Do ya, punk? question"", then strolling off on a bloodied leg.

Director Don Siegel gives the movie a gritty, slightly grimy feel, with Callahan drifting through sleazy strip clubs, abandoned rock quarries and the occasional rooftop with a suicidal person clinging to it. And it has a strong feeling of realism, even during the more ""Hollywood"" scenes -- when Harry leaps off a bridge onto the roof of a schoolbus, it doesn't look like a stunt. It looks REAL.

He also injects a note of shocking horror into some of the scenes, such as when Robinson's Scorpio begins crazily threatening children when they start freaking out. It's especially scary because we've seen innocent people killed by this maniac, so we know he's perfectly capable of hurting the children.

""Dirty Harry"" became an instant classic for a reason -- not only does it introduce us to the gritty anti-hero cop, but it let the world know that Clint Eastwood was a legend. Harrowing, brilliant and bloody."

21,2.0,"This is a weird freaking movie. The only redeeming quality is that Ford is as yummy as ever. I think this movie may have some value in a timeline with other films but honestly, even though everyone says it's great, I just don't see it. It's weird and boring.

The spandex and/or Ford might keep your attention, but the plot won't."
22,3.0,"Warner didn't took advantage of the DVD format by adding the special features(like the theatrical trailer) and a 5.1 soundtrack. I had to tune up the volume up to 20 decibels(I own a home theatre system). The picture quality looks better than the 97 release though. I didn't buy this new DVD because I borrowed it from a friend and Warner did not do a good job with this years release. I hope next years release is better like the size of a mammoth loaded with lots of goodies. We'll see.

Roy Batty is freaking hilarious in his last minutes of his life. :)"
23,5.0,Its the freaking Titanic! Whats not to love?!  I'm pretty sure I have seen this move at least 20 times and it never gets old!
24,5.0,"This movie is a real inspiration to me. I too long to have Swayzes ""a** in my trophy room."" Hey, who wouldn't? You don't mess with Dalton. He'll rip your freaking throat out (spoiler alert!) But he'll be really conflicted about it. Because, philosophy. and Tai Chi."
25,5.0,"I absolutely adore this movie. Not only does it bring back good memories as a teenager, I also liked Heather in this movie. It is very sad she died at the age of 12 in Feb. 1988. Had she lived, I think she would have had more acting roles, if she wanted them.
For me growing up as a teen in the '80s, it was a nice time in my life. Being 16 in Nov. 1982, I saw this for the first time on cable TV, which was a new thing in those years. So, I really never got to see it in the theater or as a ""widescreen"" movie until later on when DVDs first started to come out.
This edition has definitely cleaned it up as it probably has never looked this good since it's debut in the theater. The sound and picture quality are fantastic, even for DVD format. I watched this on a 60 inch Samsung LED TV with 3D surround sound. The extra features they added to this are ok, but could have been better. Come on WB! This is the 25th Anniversary, can you please make an attempt to at least bring over some of the features from the Laserdisc and the Theatrical Trailer? Although I rank this movie a classic in my book with fond remembrances, the special features could have been much better.
WB, MGM, and MIRAMAX are apparently going down in Blu-ray history for making skimpy bare bones discs with little or no extras on them. MGM being the worst as some Blu-rays don't even have a freaking menu.
Paramount and Fox are the leaders in this format, for me anyway. I own at least 500 Blu-rays as of this writing. I have still a few hundred DVDs, some not worth an upgrade, but most I have replaced as far superior editions.
As quality of the film and sound itself, a definite improvement here over previous editions. 5 stars.  I think we can all agree on that, but to put out a 25th Anniversary with a few ""poltergeist"" doctors features, it doesn't do this edition justice for overall acceptance of the movie's fans. GET IT RIGHT WB!

Perhaps in the future, we can get a nice package with ALL movies and added features together in one box set which would include the Theatrical Trailers!  The added features already exist, plus they can make some new ones with Craig T. and JoBeth Williams discussing the making of the movie. I am sure they would love to do it.
Heck, if Barbara Steele (Queen of Gothic Horror) can come and do one on several of her movies and career, surely they can.

26,5.0,"Well-done original ghost stories are among the best forms of horror. This is certainly one of those movies that demonstrated that there has always been that fear of the unknown but when it's in your house, after your children, it's always that more terrifying.

 We have geniouses behind this masterpiece. Stephen Spielberg as the director/producer has already proven he could build terror in Jaws and proves it again with this. Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) is the producer/director as well although there is some dispute over where to lend the credit. Spielberg actually wrote the story and screenplay himself, which surprised me a little as I always thought he was just the director for awhile.

 But enough with movie politics. Steve is a successful realtor, and with his wife Diane, daughter Carol Anne, teenager Dana, and son Robby, they all live in the Freeling house. A 2 story but not overly huge home in your typical suburban surroundings.

 Carol Anne is the main star and she's as cute as a button. We instantly fall in love with her. She is just too precious and it was a wide decision casting her as the focal point. The acting could NOT be improved upon. JoBeth Williams and Craig T. Nelson really hold it together.

 At first when haunting incidents occure (accompanied with beautiful sound effects/music and perfect anything else) they're just exciting for the mother and daughter duo while they freak out the father. One night during a thunderstorm a tree comes to life, breaks through the childrens window, and grabs Robbie. Distracting the parents, Carol Anne is summoned to the TV, where she is sucked into a ghostly type of void.

 The family then goes through sheer hell to try and get her back - including hiring a quirky parapsychological ghostbuster Tangina.

 This movie has some really wierd parts like where the ghosts are filmed coming down the stairs or the toy clown from under the bed. And, just when you think it's alright in this movie, something else seems to happen.

 If I look deep enough I can uncover some minor faults. One is the boy. He's not the worst actor but he irritates me, especially the scene where he's freaking out about his sister in the TV. It's..irritating. But other than that, nothing much.

 Great ending, great beginning, great cast, great suspense, great plot all equal Poltergiest. A hell of a ghost movie that you should have seen by now. If not, shame on you!"
27,2.0,"I spent a good portion of my teen years in Riverdale (Bronx) near JFK High in the late 70s and early 80s when the hiphop culture was starting and the music was referred to as ""freaking out music"" (after a then-popular dance). Wild Style, Charlie Ahearn's early hip hop flick, pretty much got it right. Then came this hollywood ripoff about 2 years later.

The story is a melodramatic version of the tale told in Wild Style. The idea of this silly fool (""Ramo""), a damn grown man who would rather paint trains than get a job to feed his girlfriend and baby-who would sympathize with such a moron? Compare this to Lee Quiniones' more authentic prototype in Wild Style. The music consists of the soulless, ultra-computerized, synthesized trash that led to the dark ages of black music of the 1980s (at least the lyrics had not yet reached the negative lows of the gangster garbage to come). Rap was actually on it's way out at the time just before this movie was filmed in the winter of 1983 (it was released that following summer), before Run DMC revived the genre with their much needed shot in the arm. This film shows why it was so bad before their arrival.

The acting is atrocious! Guy Davis supposedly angry speech to Rae Dawn Chong's dance class about exploiting the hip hop culture is so contrived and poorly acted that it causes laughter instead of tension. No wonder he was never heard from in films after this!

The only thing worth seeing here are the break battles early in the film (although breakdancing generally gets tiring to watch after a period of time). The party in the abandoned building with bootleg electricity early in the film (with the beloved Sharah ""Sha-Rock"" Greene of the Funky 4+1 More among others taking a turn at the mike) DOES capture the flavor and spirit of the era well.

The Treacherous Three (with young Kool Moe Dee and Dougie Fresh) are quite amusing in their politically incorrect rap skit about Santa Claus on welfare (""My GI Joe turned out GI gay!""), we get breif glipmses of the legendary hiphop inventor Kool DJ Herc in what amounts to a cameo, as well as a performance or two from Afrika Bambaata's Soul Sonic Force. Melle Mel is in rare form during his pwerful performance of ""Beat Street breakdown."" These factors raise the movie for me from 1 to 2 stars.

If they isolated the appearances and performances of the true rap pioneers on this DVD without the dumb story and bad acting, then it would be worthwhile."
28,3.0,"An incredible disappointment. I love this movie. Pam Grier is gorgeous and will rock your socks off. Sid Haig is in it. It's directed by Jack Hill. There's a dismemberment by airplane sequence that doesn't even attempt to look real. What's not to love? Mainly this special feature-less package!! There are zero special features. NONE!! Nothing whatsoever. This is 2016 and it is a Blu Ray. How on Earth this film managed to get released without a single special feature in the US blows my mind. Not even a trailer?!?! Don't get me wrong, I am pleased as punch to own this movie but I buy Blu Ray's because I want the whole kit and kaboodle. I want documentaries and trailers and commentary. I'd just watch freaking Netflix if I just wanted to watch a movie and move on with my life. Olive Films do Jack Hill, Pam Grier and film fans a great disservice by putting out such a lacklustre product when so many others like Scream Factory, Arrow Video, Criterion, Severin and others are putting out remarkable Blu Ray packages that are sometimes worth buying for the bonuses alone. Someone oughta school Olive Films on how you put out Blu Ray's in this day and age. Boo!!! I couldn't rate this less than 3 stars because I love this movie. But I couldn't rate this 5 stars because of how cheap Olive Films are. So right down the middle with three stars. Movie? Five stars. Olive Films? Zero stars."
29,5.0,"This is a PERFECT example of an excellent DVD.  It has incredible picture and sound quality, awesome extras, and [best of all] it's an unbelievely GREAT movie.
First of all, the picture quality is great.  I have a regular 36"" TV and watching this movie on VHS blurrs some details.  For instance the ending scene with Lector walking away free in some forgein country, unlike on the VHS, on the DVD version, everyone of the dozens of people Lector passes by is explicitly clear and is clearly defined.
Next, the bonus stuff is super.  It has lots of deleted scenes, including a few which introduce the character of Paul Krendler [who plays a major role in ""Hannibal""].  Then the Outtake reel was nice, after being so tense watching the movie, it was nice to see outtakes of the characters acting naturally.  The featurette was also nice [for a featurette], but what really blew my socks off was the documentary.  The documentary, entitled ""Inside the Labyrinth"" was about 1 hr 10 min long, and was incredibly interesting and well put together.  It was surprizing to find all the incredible behind the scenes talent who worked on this movie; like Coleen Atwood, Howard Shore, Kristi Zea.  Also, after freaking me out in the movie, it was neat seeing Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill) out of character.  Exceptional documentary on an exceptional movie.
This is now one of the favorite DVDs, and an incredible addition to any DVD collection."
30,5.0,"I recently saw The Exorcist in theaters.  Scariest movie of all time my foot.  Which of these keeps you awake at night: a little girl in green makeup, or a tongue-devouring, muzzle-clad Anthony Hopkins?  This is the only movie that has even come close to freaking me out.  Hopkins held me in a trance with his big, penetrating eyes... Foster delivered the best performance of her career... the intensity and visual style of the whole thing made it unforgettable.  The psychological thriller to end all psychological thrillers and subtly frightening enough to gain itself the position of the scariest movie ever made.
NOTE: If The Exorcist, The Sixth Sense, The Haunting, or any other such ""scary movie"" gave you the creeps, never watch The Silence of the Lambs if you hope to sleep again.  Then again, that's a small price to pay for an experience such as this."
31,4.0,"Honestly, watching Silence of the Lambs nowadays, it's just so freaking obvious how much the X-Files took from it.  Of course, much has been said about  Foster's Starling being the inspiration for the X-Files's Dana  Scully.  However, the influence of this movie -- the cinemtography, mood,  dialogue, pacing, costumes, and villians -- is just so clear on the  X-Files, especially its first season.
Unfortunatedly, having watched the  X-Files for years, it has dulled the impact of Silence of the Lambs.  Its  style has been so copied and done that Silence of the Lambs merely now  seems like among the best of its type, rather than a groundbreaking  thriller.
Still, I'd highly recommend its viewing, if nothing else but to  see where the X-Files took its basic skeleton from."
32,4.0,"** This review contains spoilers. **

Sandra Larson has always been fascinated by death, especially as a sensory experience. As a child, she created rituals to bury dead animal that drove off her only childhood friend. These rituals were to her the only proper way to honor the dead. In college, she works at a flower shop, which inevitably leads her to Wallis Funeral Home, where she decides to work and study embalming. This is also where her obsession with death culminates in becoming a necrophiliac. During her study of embalming in college, Sandra meets Matt and impulsively decides to be completely open about her odd sexual proclivities. He becomes obsessed with her, trying to find out why she feels  the way she does about the dead and why he isn't enough. How far can their relationship last? How far will Matt go in search of answers and how much can Sandra feel for a living person?

I saw this movie a few years and ago and was completely fascinated with it. Although necrophilia is obviously disturbing and taboo, this isn't a film that wants to to disgust or repel, like Cerda's Aftermath or the German Nekromatik films. Some may find it boring because it doesn't have the in-your-face gore and extremely disgusting scenes that these other films have. At its core, it's a love story. Sandra is a normal, every day girl, for the most part. She really could be anyone. Her appearance is normal and her only weird aspect (besides the obvious) is that she doesn't interact with people much. The greatest part of the film is that Sandra isn't portrayed as a horrible, grotesque monster, which would have been very easy to do. She doesn't have sex with corpses because she's kinky or wants some sort of power over them, but because she sees it as a consensual spiritual experience. She believes there is still an energy and vitality in them after death and she can release and feel it with her love. Her actions are compared to that of the funeral director, who she discovers is also a necrophiliac. He prefers little boys (adding one taboo on top of another), obviously for personal pleasure, and reasons that they can't feel anything anyway. Sandra is horrified by it because it's a desecration of the dead, while she celebrates and respects those she is with. Molly Parker does a phenomenal job as Sandra, making her a sympathetic and sensitive character.

Matt is also an interesting character. He doesn't react as most people would when Sandra reveals her secret and he becomes obsessed with the reasoning behind it. He senses that she pulls away from their relationship. In an effort to be what she wants, he only succeeds in freaking her out and she holds him at an even greater distance than before. Although she has feelings for him, she's never been with anyone living and still feels drawn to dead people. His solution is to kill himself so he can be with her in a way she can connect with. The end scene is beautiful, haunting, and bitterweet.

Kissed is a wonderful film that shows necrophilia, an obviously distasteful subject, in an artful light. Sandra isn't condemned as monster. It acts as a character piece that shows the development of her fascination of death from childhood. It's a brave film that is easy to condemn, but shows this taboo in an unexpected way."
33,1.0,"What more can be said than awful. Ok, How about hideous, disgusting, vile, trite, pathetic, and utterly contrived. The first SPEED was bad enough, was there really a need for a sequel, and on a cruise ship, give me a freaking break. Even Keanu wouldn't star in this nightmare movie from hell, that's how truly awful it was.
I almost wish I could sue the film company for the hour or so I wasted by watching it when it came on cable. It was like a car accident, no matter how hard I tried I couldn't look away. I practically needed a ""Silkwood"" shower after viewing it, and my cat is still have nightmares about it, he screams in his sleep now. I wish only there was a way to erase these things from my permanent memory, and movie history in general."
34,2.0,"Mr. Lucas...you have a problem.  Why would fans want to buy the same set one year later without the 2 and a half hour documentary that we (I don't think I'm alone here) had a blast watching?  When I saw the new box with the original artwork, I thought to myself, wow, he finally came to his senses and released the original trilogy the way it was in theaters; I was very disappointed to find out that it wasn't.  Why mess with a classic?  I know you and Spielberg have a competition to see whose movie (Star Wars or ET) will get rereleased the most times, but man, come on now, this is getting re-freaking-diculous!  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed seeing all the new stuff in the special editions on the big screen, as I was not alive in 1977 and did not get see New Hope or Empire in the theaters, but please give it up and release the original pictures the way that every genuine child of the 70s and 80s has been waiting for ever since the inception of DVD almost 10 years ago.  My patience is wearing thin, get your act together."
35,4.0,"BUT why did they change the movies, i mean Han Solo not shooting that guy in the bar first was like a very important part of his character. His whole part in the movie was like himself redeeming himself for all his wrong doings. and the return of the jedi, without the ewok song. WTH. i maen they play that other music right over it, why did he change the movies, i thought this was supposed to be the original movies, not the special edition.

I mean i love the movies all of them, even the new ones, but changing the old ones so that we have no choice; eg. this will be the only DVD release of the movie, why'd he do that. Its like not fair, i wanted to watch it in its original entirety and now i have to go back to the VHS tapes to see stuff the way it was.

I meanthe movies are freaking awesome on DVD and they look suberb its just that, i liked them the way they were so much. blah. maybe i'm just being way to critical, i'm sure i'll probably watch it just as many times as i've watched it on VHS before. and with the special features its really keeps things interesting."
36,3.0,"A great Stanley Kubrick movie which balances comedy (laughing in the face of death) and nail-biting thriller.
All of the actors do an excellent job and brilliantly play their parts straight (you gotta love the scenes with George C. Scott freaking out -- especially his scene with ""THE GIANT  BOARD!"").
Kubrick did an excellent job of taking the fear of nuclear  disaster and mocking it. This is one of his best and most fully realized  films, and one can't help but await the day that a special edition DVD with  deleted scenes is released."

39,1.0,"I hated this movie within the first five minutes. The leading lady (Talia Shire) is what drove me mad, I hated her screen munching mug the second they showed her face. Now I realize this actress represents some evil baby setter who used to make me pop the boils on her festered up back, but that is not the movies fault.

So you may enjoy this film much more then I, it does start off with the old hags hubby slamming the girl down the street, (I bet that means he will die). My god could any one who is over the age of 10 really have the nerve to give this trash 5 Stars, no freaking way people.

Even with another actress in the lead this would be a pretty poor film. Don't forget gang I am here for you and I just want to ease your suffering as some of you may learn from my pain."

Nothing goes to gather better then a magic 24 K gold flute, Leprechauns, and rappers trying to make it big. And just for the record, the second best Leprechaun movie of the series was the 4th one and the 3rs was the first.

41,2.0,"Do not waste your money unless you are making a collection of dario argento's most embarrassing moments.

blah!

I was very dismayed after seeing this movie. So many things, I will just list the ones that are sticking in my mind.

1. how did the phantom learn so much from stinking rats?

2. why is christine bipolar with him?

3. Why so many naked love scenes when the guy is shooting his own daughter? gross

4. why does the phantom make easy kills out of all the other people who come to his ""underworld"" but he never seems to get the time to kill the freaking rat killer!!! hello! absurd!!

5. why is so very obvious that all of the singers are faking, and why is it also obvious that while the actors are speaking english, there have been voice overs done by people who make you sit there and think..."" that voice did not come out of that person""...it's awful.

6. how the heck did christine and raoul fall in love? and i know the answer, but this movie, if you are not already a phantom lover, will most certainly not explain it for you.

Ok, so there are my bottom line reasons for thinking that this rendition of Phantom needs to be trashed. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because Asia Argento has her moments where you can tell she might have a little real acting skill."
42,1.0,"I specifically waited to buy this on DVD hoping to get a Todd-AO version and not just the Cinemascope version.  The freaking Laserdisc looks better than this!  I, for one, will not be buying any more ""special editions"" without reading the reviews in Amazon or elsewhere when it comes to 20th Century ripoff.  This release reminds me of all the 20Th Laserdiscs that were first released when laser was just starting out and how poorly the transfers were treated...now it seems we're right back to the good old bad transfer days of yore.  Yuk, I recommend that no one buy ANY of their discs (especially the upcoming crappy versions of STAR WARS non-anamorphic, non-5.1 sound original movies).  These people suck big time!

43,5.0,"I had the good fortune to be a young kid in the 1970's, when TV-movies had real bite.  Cheesy as some of them may seem now, 70's made-for-TV thrillers like 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark', ""Five Desperate Women', ""Satan's School for Girls', 'Trilogy of Terror', 'The Spell', 'Killer Bees' and others creeped you the hell out when you first watched them ... and 40-odd years later, some of them still have that power today (just check out some of the reviews, here on Amazon, of the above titles!), and withOUT having the extreme gore or violence that so many makers of thrillers seem to feel is necessary for today's films (made-for-TV or otherwise).

'Dying Room Only' was a personal favorite of mine, an hours and a half (with commericals) of nail-biting suspense made 100% real by the presence of the pretty-much-can-do-no-wrong Cloris Leachman.

Here, as Jean Mitchell, she plays an upper middle class woman who, on a trip along with her husband, stops at a diner in the dessert for a quick bite to eat before hitting the highway again.  When her husband decides to make a quick trip to the bathroom and never comes back, things get freaky VERY fast when the guy running the diner not only insists he never saw her husband, but that in fact when Jean came into the diner she was completely alone.

Something is seriously wrong when no one will admit to having seen her husband, and even as Jean's sanity is questioned WE (the viewers) are with Jean all the way; as she looks more into the mystery, trying to find her husband, both the suspense and Jean's trek into escalating danger will have you on the edge of your seat.  Thanks to Leachman's brilliant work, you will care like HELL about Jean's plight, wanting her to find her husband (hopefully alive), as well as learn just what the hell is going on with these sinister people ... who become increasingly more threatening as the minutes - and Jean's determination - tick on.

Leachman is SO freaking great in this, and I didn't even realize until today that this was on DVD; gotta get it.  It's a TV-movie classic the likes of which they don't make anymore - they don't write anymore.  And a performance by Ms. Leachman, beyond Phyllis and 'The Last Picture Show' and Maw Maw, that you aren't soon going to forget."
44,4.0,"Here's an interesting bit of trivia (okay, maybe not so much interesting, but worth noting, at least)...seems the film This Island Earth (1955) was one of the first major science fiction features filmed in Technicolor, a process that actually had been around, in various states, since the early twentieth century.  Directed by Joseph M. Newman (The Gunfight at Dodge City, Tarzan, the Ape Man), the film stars Rex Reason (The Creature Walks Among Us), Faith Domergue (It Came from Beneath the Sea, Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet), and Jeff Morrow (Kronos, The Giant Claw).  Also appearing is Lance Fuller (The She-Creature), Robert Nichols (Giant), and Russell Johnson (Attack of the Crab Monsters), probably best known as `The Professor', from the mid 1960s series ""Gilligan's Island"".

As the film begins we meet a scientist named Dr. Cal Meacham (Reason), preparing to leave Washington D.C. after attending a conference on atomic energy.  Anyway, Cal borrows a jet to fly home (must be nice), and upon arriving, his plane conks out due to some showboating (nice play, Shakespeare), but Cal is saved as a mysterious force takes control and lands the vehicle safely, much to the amazement of Cal and his dopey assistant named Joe (Nichols), who I think is supposed to provide a comedic element for the film, failing miserably I might add.  But wait, there's more...shortly after Cal's return he receives a catalog featuring advanced electronic components related to assembling something called an `interocitor', which turns out of be a fancy, schmancy triangular television with some pretty amazing and far out capabilities (actually, it looks a bit like the drive-thru order box at a fast food restaurant, but that's neither here nor there).  Once constructed, Cal receives a message from a melon headed, white haired nerdlinger type named Mr. Exeter (Morrow), who invites Cal to join a mysterious brain trust whose purpose appears to be development of new forms of atomic energy.  His curiosity piqued, Cal hops a plane (one which he isn't piloting, thankfully), and ends up in a remote location somewhere in Georgia where he hooks up with Exeter (apparently he's dropped the `Mr' routine), Dr. Ruth Adams (Domergue), another scientist named Steve Carlson (Johnson), among others...eventually Cal learns Exeter is not of this Earth (well duh) and his motives for assembling Team Brainiac not as altruistic as originally stated, which leads to Cal and Ruth trying to escape, only to get beamed aboard Exeter's spacecraft (commence the probings), complete with swishy doors, and transported to Exeter's home planet called Metaluna (once you reach Neptune, hang a right and go about three billion miles, look for the Stuckeys and you're there).  As far as what happens next you'll just have to watch the film, but I will share this, there's aliens, an honest to goodness flying saucer, ookie mutants with huge brains and oversized claws with a penchant for pinching, killer remote-controlled meteors, some dude named The Monitor (sound ominous, doesn't it?), matte paintings of fantastic alien landscapes, and so on...

I really liked this film a lot...sure, the acting leaves something to be desired (Rex Reason probably could have been replaced with a tree and few would have noticed), but there appeared to be a real sense of ambition towards the presentation of the material.  The main strength of this film is the special effects, which, in my opinion, come off pretty well.  Certainly compared to today's standards they'll seem hokey, but I'm betting when the film was originally released audiences were amazed and I'll doubt few left the theater feeling like they didn't get their money's worth.  The bits I thought really odd were how some of these so called scientists, at least the ones who didn't have their minds `toyed' with, at the Georgia facility seemed so slow on the uptake with regards to figuring out their host was an alien (I would have thought the ginormous cranium a dead giveaway).  And then once they did figure it out, no one seemed that surprised or shocked.  Honestly, had it been me being abducted and taken a bazillion miles into outer space, ending up on some alien planet I would have been seriously freaking out, but neither Cal nor Ruth really seemed all that upset.  Perhaps scientists are made of sturdier stuff than us non-brainy types, of which I consider myself one.  As far as the characters there was some promising development early on, but it eventually faded as those introduced fell into homogenous roles (Reason the rugged, masculine hero type, Domergue the attractive screaming mimi in peril, etc.).  Morrow's character of Exeter did seem to have the most potential, in terms of his altering certain plans based on his developing an understanding of humans after spending time with them, but this sort of petered out a bit, taking a backseat to the visual aspects present in the film, which is a fairly common pitfall in the genre, especially in today's films, in terms of flashy effects superseding the more substantial elements of the story.  All in all you can certainly find plenty of fault with this feature, but I'd suggest viewing the film with a slightly less critical eye, as not to miss all the fun.

The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), does look really good, despite areas that exhibit some minor signs of age (there weren't any frames missing, but there was some specking here and there).  As far as the Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio, I thought it came through very well and had no complaints.  There's not much in the way of extras except for an original theatrical trailer and subtitles in English, Spanish, and French.  I was a little surprised at the lack of an audio commentary, especially since I've always considered this staple film in the classic science fiction genre, maybe not to the extent of those like The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), The Thing from Another World (1951), or Forbidden Planet (1956), but one still worthy of attention.

45,5.0,"Wow! Who says you need blood, guts and gore to make a good horror movie? Sometimes all you have to do is place yourself in a person's shoes and feel their utter terror in order to experience true horror chill through your bones. I still can't believe that this is director Steven Spielberg's first film. He should have gotten the 1971 ""Rookie of The Year"" Award.

Ever experienced road rage? I have. Usually it was in the form of an obscene finger gesture. But road rage comes in other forms; forms such as gigantic semis with ""Caterpillar"" diesels roaring at your car bumper. With 1971's ""Duel,"" you are literally put in the drivers seat with Dennis Weaver on one of the most hellish highway races around. I remember watching in horror with my heart doing flips in my chest during my first encounter with this movie on television years ago. I've seen this movie several times since.

Dennis Weaver, perfectly cast for this role with his panicked deer-caught-in-the-headlights eyes and his chilling hysterical shrieks, plays a salesman named David Mann who is on the road to an important meeting. On the way, he finds himself coughing behind the fumes of a huge semi in front of him. We find out pretty quickly that it does not take much to piss this semi-driver off. After they each take their turns of passing one another, the semi driver promptly leads David Mann on into an on-coming car. Okay....this is not your ordinary Sunday-drive on the road.

The suspense builds as the semi virtually rides Mann's bumper down the road at at least 100 mph in a seemingly endless saga, forcing Mann to go beyond all limits and finally come ""crashing"" into a nearby ""Chuck's Cafe."" What follows is one of the more humorous parts of the film when Mann becomes suspicious of everyone in the cafe being this dreaded driver, and ends up getting into a fight with one of the customers. Word to the wise, if someone tells you to ""Just cut it out"" and then slaps your sandwich out of your hand, you best put up your dukes and fight like a man!

Unfortunately the time comes for David Mann to be on his merry way, and he's off like a dirty shirt; sweat stains and all, back on the road again in that little red Plymouth. Anyway, I bet you can pretty much guess what lies ahead for the poor salesman. Actually there are many things lying ahead for David Mann from attempting to help a stalled busload of kids, to nearly getting pushed into a fast-moving train, to a frustrating encounter with a freaked-out elderly couple, to the stop at the reptilian gas station that gets rudely trashed. The semi driver was intent on creating a ""duel"" to the death with David Mann.

A bit of comic relief takes hold as Mann struggles to give a school bus of kids a push with his little red car only to be literally chased away by ""Mr. Diesel."" Adding to the comedy is the elderly couple whom Mann tries to stop and tell to call the police. Mann only succeeds in freaking them out and is chased away by the mighty ton on wheels. Then there's that classic reptile gas station, and I must say, I felt so bad for the woman running the place. Here is a middle-aged woman who is passionate about her caged snakes, lizards and spiders surrounding the station. She's clear out in the boonies and probably gets hardly any business at all. Needless to say, she is overjoyed when David Mann pulls up to let her check under the hood of the car while he checks into a phone booth to call the police. Unfortunately the diesal takes care of the poor lady's station in an attempt to get after Mann. Obviously, Mann needed to heed Dr. Diesel's wishes and get back on the road of terror where he belonged.

Probably the most terrifying part of the film comes toward the end when Mann is being chased by the semi up a grade. If you have not watched this movie before and are planning to watch it for the first time, you may have a difficult time getting through this part and need a paper bag to breathe in. This scene involves a radiator hose, lots of hissing steam, speed dials dropping, spine-tingling screams and pleading from David Mann ringing in your ears and the sound of the engine frying. And no, we're not talking about fried chicken. This all comes together to create one of the most edge-of-your-seat experiences around.

For those of you who have not yet seen this movie, I will leave you with a few little details. #1: You will learn just how handy a brief case can be when you're in a jam, #2: A fire's blaze can be quite blinding, and #3 Living on the edge will eventually leave no edge to live on. Unfortunately you may just realize it when you're flying off a cliff.

Something that is definitely worth a mention is the music of the film. It is intense, frantic; the music of an adrenaline rush echoing the rapid pounding heartbeat of someone on the run with racing thoughts filling the head. Urgent and screeching violins and other haunting sounds; I really mean HAUNTING, completely engulf you that much more into the terrifying world of David Mann and the deranged madness of the truck driver. Even the truck itself looks mean; dirty and metal-colored with a face only a mother could love. In this case, the truck and driver make perfect partners in crime.

Also definitely worth a mention are the highway shots throughout the movie. We get some excellent footage of the truck's tires grinding against the hot pavement as well as its foreboding bug-smashed grill. The quick shots of the speedometer dropping and speeding up in Mann's car is a fantastic touch, and the overall chasing scenes down the highway are very well done. You can feel the speed, the terror rise, and you'll be guaranteed to get very anxious.

Dennis Weaver does an EXCELLENT job in this film as we see some amazing close-ups of his terror-drenched face and his hysterical yells at the truck driver and at his own car to go faster. The close-up shots of him looking back frantically to see how far the truck is behind him, really add to the mounting terror. Weaver is a very versatile actor in that he can swing from the calm man listening to the radio on his way to the meeting, to the frantic man literally driving for his life.

The extras in the movie are worth the price as you get a complete history on how the movie came about, and the making of the movie with all the techniques, tricks and styles that Spielberg chronicles for us in his commentary. You'll even find out how he picked out his actors/actresses for the film, as well as the truck! It is quite interesting indeed.

I tell you, even though this is Spielberg's first full-length film, it is one of his very best works, let alone early works. As my heart raced and panic rose during my first viewing of the film, I remember my mom telling me that this was a Steven Spielberg film. Then I, totally engrossed in this amazing 1971 film, turned to her and said, ""Well that explains it."""
46,5.0,"I really like the idea of a love story between a tough-yet-gentle earth girl, Beverly, and an alien who just happens to look like an Earth duck but who is just a regular guy on his planet.  You can sympathize with Howard's character--in one scene, Beverly hides him in a TRASH BAG- ""I just don't want people freaking out all over the place."" Howard-""What about me?  I'm gonna be in therapy for the rest of my life.""  (I love all his smart-aleck remarks.)  Despite this treatment, he comes to love her and when a new alien that really qualifies as a monster kidnaps her, he gets their friend Phil to help him rescue her, despite not having any way to fight other than knowing a bit of ""quack-fu"".  My personal favorite scene is where Howard and Philsie (as Howard dubs him) steal a tiny motor-powered hang-glider type airplane and have this hilariously wild flight with the cops shooting at them, despite neither of them knowing how to fly a plane!

I saw HTD at age 13, and liked it so much I went and bought the comic book series (even though I don't read comics), the bubblegum cards and then, years later, I discovered that the story had been continued (or had an alternate story; I can't remember now) in a set of 7 magazine-sized graphic-novel type issues, in black-and-white art.  I still have them.  In one, Beverly ends up going to Howard's world, where she is seen as the freak.

Bad reviews aside, HTD has always been, for me, a great combination of wacky humor, funky music, intriguing romance, creepy alien bad guys, and some of the best one-liners ever!"
47,1.0,"So I- somehow, God help me- found myself watching Grizzly, a mid-70s monster-horror featuring a giant grizzly bear. The promotional posters for Grizzly featured the tagline 18 feet of gut-crunching, man-eating terror. Well, it was grizzly, all right, but I doubt it was the kind of grizzly the producers were aiming for.

Someone *recommended* this film to me. Suffice to say we are no longer on speaking terms.

The film opened with some promise as one of the main characters, Don/NamMan, helicopters some sightseers over the unnamed national park which serves as the films setting. We get some beautiful shots of tree-clad mountains and valleys which NamMan claims are virgin and untouched since before Europeans came to America. Im thinking Hey, maybe weve got an environmental message!, and the long shots in the title sequence  along with the recommendation of a previously trusted friend  make me think Grizzly was headed to be something more than just a monster movie.

Then we got into Act 1, which soundly dispelled those naive notions.

After some confusion with who the hell the protagonist is, we find out its Michael Kelly. Ill be calling him Chiseljaw, though, since thats all he is: a beautiful jawline meant to attract reluctant female movie-goers. Chiseljaw runs Unnamed Park as the direct supervisor of its many inept park-rangers, and were led to believe the majority of his job involves babysitting hikers and making sure they don't go about setting wildfires or getting themselves lost. He has a romantic interest whos cast as the Strong Female, but theres no point in even assigning her a nickname, since shes completely irrelevant to the plot. As a matter of fact, there isn't a single female in Grizzly who exists for any reasons besides as fodder for aforementioned giant bear. Oh, and cleavage/midriff, which I suppose passed for racy back in the 70s.

The only characters who matter  as much as any character can matter in this sort of film, anyways  are Chiseljaw, NamMan (Don, the obligatory Vietnam veteran who I thought was the protagonist when he flew us over the forest), and BearDude, whose name I forget but was maybe Scott but doesnt freaking matter because all you need to know is that hes a naturalist and likes to cosplay as a bear, or deer, or something.

I dunno. Hes got a massive fur cape, and he digs bears. So today hes BearDude.

Anyways, some sexy ladies get merced by the bear, which sets off an investigation and a killing spree of approximately nine-thousand people. Plot juice, but its cheap plot juice. Seriously, its like they figured out they only had thirty minutes of actual film, and the director just said Oh, its cool, sprinkle in a bear-murder between every scene until weve got a movie.

And Im not using murder flippantly, either. This is basically a serial-killer movie, only the serial-killer is a big dumb animal lacking the psychologically twisted aspect of a good serial-killer villain, and instead of cops, the good guys are park rangers. We even get the obligatory gun-and-badge scene we by now expect from that sort of cop movie, where Chiseljaw begs his Chief (or park supervisor, whatever) Let me do my job, to which the Chief responds Youre in over your head and threatens to fire him. Not those literal words, but you get my drift. I found myself wondering whether the writer didn't simply deconstruct the worst murder-spree movie ever and rewrite everything with a bear-centric focus, and to be honest Im unconvinced he didn't do exactly that.

The irony there is that its not even a good monster movie. I was unsurprised to discover Grizzly released hot on the tails of Jaws, which I suppose was the kind of movie they wanted to emulate. Knowing that, the blatant ripoff was pretty obvious. But it still felt closer to a dozen cop movies Ive seen than to Jaws.

Trudging right along, Chiseljaw, BearDude and NamMan form the least effective power-trio in cinema history. Later on I started to like NamMan, who probably would have made a better protagonist than wet-blanket Chiseljaw, and BearDude was ok too in the lovable-weirdo sense, but we all know the best buddies are only there so they can die late in the game anyways. Their bumbling is only offset by the Chief, who (were guided to believe) is playing politics by bringing press to the park and hoping to attract more visitors, or a cushy job offer for himself, by highlighting the fact that two million and counting visitors have been viciously mauled and devoured by a ginormous prehistoric bear.

You cant see me, but just know Im rolling my eyes.

The worst aspect of Grizzly, though, is ironically the freakin grizzly. Many of the shots of its feet (before the not-so-big reveal) are cearly a black bear. At one point an adult black bear is trotted onto the set and a bunch of hunters think its the grizzlys cub, which ends in some hilarious bear-on-bear violence. When the grizzly attacks, it never once bites its victims: its killing move, as far as I can tell, is split between either a lethal bear hug and a swing of its mighty claws, which at one point literally decapitates a horse in a single swipe.

I wish I had something good to say. I wish I could post a review that wasn't entirely comprised of ridicule and mockery. But the unfortunate fact is that ridicule and mockery are more than Grizzly deserves.

It should have languished in ignominy, forgotten in the dusty halls of crappy films. It doesnt deserve a Wikipedia page. It should have withered and died on the vine anonymously, unreleased, and  barring that  nobody should have been talking about it one year later, much less forty.

Instead my idiot friend recommended it to me, which is the only reason this review exists. To me, the real lesson in Grizzly is Be Careful Who You Trust. Oh, and if you're going to make a bear movie, you should know something about bears."
48,2.0,"So...to say I was a little let down after seeing this 1966 film version would be the understatement of the year. For starters, there was no robot dog in the movie...at all - bummer. Secondly, Clarisse is a school teacher who he's supposedly having an affair with in the movie as opposed to the innocent, 16 year-old non-conformist neighbor in the book. Thirdly, he never meets the professor until after he's already escaped. Oh yeah..and the firemen on rocket-propelled boosters looked like clowns in a freaking circus sent to provide comic relief! With the 60's fashion and women's hair styles in the movie I felt ill. And I'd be remissed if I failed to mention the ostensibly futuristic fire engine that looked like a cross between the batmobile(the old one) and a station wagon from hell that they painted red and decided to call a fire truck. The book is an amazing 5 stars and one of my all-time favs, but as for the movie - it's a real laugher - but for all of the wrong reasons. I'd love to see Spielberg make it with today's technology - it would finally do the book justice."
49,5.0,"I don't care what anyone says-this one IS better than the original.  It's slicker, it's faster, it's more intense, the girls have better boobs...  What's there NOT to like about it-especially when comparing it to the original (and that's pretty-much all anyone can seem to do).  The best part:  It MAKES SENSE!  Jason RUNS!  Jason has a labyrinth of tunnels under the camp, which he's been constructing for years.  In the original, he didn't run and he had nothing-no real reason to always be RIGHT behind the person running for his or her life except that he's freaking JASON and that's just stupid. I laughed my way through the entire franchise the first time.  This is the first Friday the 13th that I'm actually going to BUY!"
50,5.0,"A classic, one of Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd's best.
Jamie Lee Curtis was freaking hot back then too."
51,5.0,Surely you can't be serious if you never seen or like this movie freaking classic I don't care what any one says a must see trust me
52,1.0,"Excrement. This film should be used as corporal punishment or as an interrogation technique to break the worst criminals. Really,really bad. Just awful. Curiously compelling , however. Like a gruesome auto accident, some dark urge makes you want to look. Then you cant ever get it out of your head again. EVER.This movie gave me freaking nightmares. Ten minutes of Pockets and his....well,pockets ,is enough to make a strong man cry. I know. I am cringing inside even as I write this, as the horror comes back. BE WARNED,WORLD!! This cinematic atrocity is so bloody rotten it will gag a maggot. VIEW AT YOUR OWN RISK, NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN,PETS,THE ELDERLY,OR ANYBODY."
53,4.0,"I got this video when was release on VHS. I love it because I'm a big fan of Kiss but I can understand why more serious Kiss fan can't enjoy it. is full of foolish scenes that are filled with hot chicks. but hey, they are the freaking Kiss band, Paul Stanley was been a clown since I have memory, but a clown in a good way, he makes me laugh and feel envy. he makes childish stuffs because its part of his character's charming.

Gene of course that will make all the dark things that show in the video. it's part of his character and people surely will not understand that Kiss since the beginning is about that, play the fantasy, or better say WELCOME TO THE SHOW. anyone that will not be an Amish or an hypocrite christian fundamentalist can tell me that don't wanna be anyone of them at least for one day?.  XD

the bad thing in the video is the lack of participation of Bruce and Eric and since he pass out, this is remarkably bad. I could bet that Paul and Gene regret that.

but stills is a great video. I'll not giving 5 stars because is a VHS copy in DVD format. even as the video was a little bit retouched in his colors, I could kill for see and hear lick it up, heavens on fire and the others in 5.1, and of course they have more space so, any extra material could be awesome. but in general, is a classic and a collection must have."
54,5.0,"This movie rules! If you don't think so then I don't want to know what you think because its probably wrong. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers on all fronts. He has a great relationship with his daughter, he can knock dudes out, and he knows how to handle the ladies. I mean he flips a freaking car with his own body! This movie has so many twists and turns that at times you're like, come on, I thought this was an action movie, why are you trying to make me keep up with something I don't care about and then he gets into a gun fight and kills a million people with his own hands and you're glad you did pay attention! Ive seen this movie probably ten times and every time its awesome! This movie is so good that Im going to watch it for an eleventh time and guess what, its probably going to still RULE! I highly recommend this movie if you like action and high-risk rescue mission like I do. This is a no brainer, 5 STARS!"
55,4.0,"The movie Black Sunday is a good movie that runs neck and neck with the current state of the world, especially with this terrorist puppet show thats being broadcasted around the world to induce fear. The movie also has a special place in my heart because when I was 7 years old my father worked a management position at the Miami Orange Bowl and allowed me and my brother to watch the filming of the stadium scenes of the movie involving the Good Year Blimp over the field and the crowd in the stadium freaking out and running for their lives. I remember when the stadium freak-out scene was being shot the extra's were on the field and the director said ""action"" and everyone went running and screaming from the blimp prop and then one of the extra's (an old lady) ruined one of the shots by saying ""oooooh"" and picking up a quarter she found on the feild, lol . But any how , If your into good terrorist movies and 70's cinematography, you'll enjoy this creative movie that involves a plot to savatage a Super Bowl game with a terrorist act of flying a blimp over the stadium field and igniting a contraption beneath the blimp that shoots out thousands of fragments that would shread the croud to peices and the football players! Will the crowd and the players be shreaded to pieces? Will the terrorist get away with crazy scheme? You'll have to watch the movie and see for yourself!"
56,5.0,"I admit right away that I LOVE the Fly!  Sure now that I'm older the film's truly not as frightening as it once was.  Seeing a man gradually transform into a human-sized house fly day by day isn't something that can actually happen, but it sure is entertaining to watch.  In fact I'd go so far as to say the Fly barely feels like a horror movie to me now.  I've either watched too many scary movies over the years and simply got used to them or maybe the actual horror elements of the Fly just don't hold up like they once did.  We *are* going back to the mid 80's after all when cheesiness in movies, TV shows and music was running wild.  Either way, who cares?  This movie is flat out exciting.  The writing is almost spot-on perfect.  It succeeds at everything but freaking me out.

It's about a man who creates a teleportation machine that enables one object to go from one machine to another.  He lives inside an apartment building and meets a journalist woman who can't wait to write an article about this.  Eventually the man gets a little impatient and perhaps arrogant and wants to risk the potential consequences by putting *himself* in the machine.  He insists on finding out if he can go through with the teleportation and walk away without any side effects.  That my friends, is a BAD idea!  And wouldn't you know it?  An innocent little fly happened to be inside the machine and sticking to the side of the window while the man was busy going from machine to machine.  No big deal right?  It's just a fly.  What's the worst that can happen?  Oh I dunno... everything.

Anyway the man steps out of the machine and believes he's perfectly fine.  However, after a while the fly similarities begin to develop for the man.  Slowly but surely, he becomes a fly!  He doesn't realize it at first however.  He just chalks up his unusual body-changing symptoms and hyperactive admiration for lust as something that can be dismissed.  This all probably sounds really cheesy to read but the movie is actually really well-done in the storytelling department.  You'll want to stick with this one until its conclusion to see what finally happens.

I guess my memory isn't as good as it once was.  Even though it's been over 20 years since I last watched the Fly, I could have sworn there was more development in how the man changes into a fly than there was, but last night while watching the movie it seemed like it was, well, not incomplete per say, but like there were a few details and segments eliminated.  Not sure if this particular version sold on amazon has any missing scenes, and I don't even know if scenes were deleted at all in *any* version for that matter.  It's probably just an episode of forgetfulness I'm going through.

Either way, my dad loves this movie as much as I do.  I remember he'd watch it on laidback Sunday afternoons in the late 80's/early 90's.  Highly recommended entertainment but don't expect it to be as terrifying as you probably remember it (or especially if you're seeing it for the first time).  On a final note while laying in bed watching this movie at 3 in the morning last night, my attention is temporarily forced towards the outside of my bedroom window where I see a green light raining down from the sky.  It was a shooting star (unless someone was shooting fireworks at 3 in the morning when it was 0 degrees outside... nah!)  Haven't seen one of those in years."
57,4.0,"""The Turning Point"" concerns best friends Emma and Dee Dee. They met as young women in a dance company in New York. Emma became a prima ballerina but has no family and a boyfriend who's married to someone else. Dee Dee married another member of the dance company, got pregnant, and moved to Oklahoma City where she and her devoted husband run a ballet school and are raising three children. Dee Dee returns to New York for a summer with her elder daughter and son so they can study with the American Ballet Company while her husband remains in Oklahoma City with the middle child. The movie explores jealousy, resentment, and the choices we make at our ""turning points."" Well-written and gorgeously-acted by Anne Bancroft as Emma and Shirley MacLaine as Dee Dee, the plot is nonetheless pretty standard soap opera fare.

Mikhail Baryshnikov played his first role in this film and it's easy to see why he has enjoyed such popularity. He out-charms and out-shines everybody not only in this movie but in just about any movie. Had they been contemporaries and Baryshnikov elected to put more effort into building an acting career, Cary Grant would have needed to watch his back--seriously. And he's a freaking amazing dancer. Maybe he's just playing himself, but he's wonderful as the Russian emigre dancer who seduces Dee Dee's eldest daughter Emilia. Sadly, Leslie Browne, a gifted dancer who plays Emilia, is WAY out of her league in the acting chops department. She seems like zombie rather than a character, and I could not shake the feeling that her line readings had been dubbed, limply, by someone else. I see why the other performers (Bancroft, MacLaine and Baryshnikov) got their Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor nominations, but I cannot begin to fathom why Browne was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this insipid sleepwalking.

The dance sequences are the real reason to watch ""The Turning Point."" They are flat-out beautiful, even if you're not a big ballet aficionado, and ""The Turning Point"" doles them out generously. If I were to watch this again, I would fast-forward through any non-dance scene that did not have Baryshnikov and just watch the dances and listen to the beautiful music accompanying them over and over."
58,1.0,"I first watched this movie YEARS ago on television and didn't understand it.  I think I was 10.  Well, 40 years have past since then and I still don't get the supposed ""charm"" of this film.  For starters, Crosby and Kaye are too old for their roles.  Like way too old.  Then you have to get past Rosemary Clooney's way-to-happy-to-be-here face/personae.  Add to that, sorry Clooney fans, she just can't sing.  I have always wanted to slap the face of the first person that ever told her that she could.  Ah.  Vera-Ellen.  Cutesy-cutesy and yes, she can dance (some) but her smile just gets in the way.

These four ""kids"" have the idea to go to Vermont to help out the old General of Crosby and Kaye from the war.  The General has an inn.  The ""kids"" have an idea.  (Oh, it's a little patriotic, too).  I find it stomach-turning to see/hear ""the kids"" on the train all excited about snow.  It's a song.  ""Snow"".  Rosemary Clooney wants to wash her face and hair in it.  No kidding.  Those are the lyrics.  This makes Clooney, right out of the gate, an idiot.  Who the hell wants to wash themselves in freaking snow?????  And Clooney is old enough to know better.

For a ""Christmas"" musical, there is woefully little holiday cheer here.

The General's former troops come to the inn, (thanks to ""the kids""; the troops obviously had nothing else to do on Christmas Eve) and the film goes dark and long and funeral-like.  Ghastly.  It's a long, long scene and one that the film should have done without.  Everyone rallies for the General.  Whomever he was/is.

What little comedy there is is supplied by Mary Wickes.  Well, thank God for that.  The plot twists don't even twist as movie fans have seen this sort of thing a thousand times before.  And better.

At the pinnacle of ""the big show"" that ""the kids"" have put on for the troops, everyone is singing ""White Christmas"", the barn door opens and it is snowing, and Rosemary Clooney gives Bing Crosby the gift of

a glass horse.

This is NOT a Christmas movie.  This is just plain 2 hours wasted out of your life."
59,5.0,"When this movie came out, I was a kid and went with the folks. Probably not too PC, but to this day, I still LOVE this film. I've turned a few friends on to it. Miss Hepburn  was freaking awesome and it still can scare the crap out of me. I have the DVD, but Blue Ray ....can't wait!!!!"
60,5.0,"At first I didn't understand what was happening but really liked the actors so kept watching.  Soon the story started to unfold.  Audrey Hepburn was clearly not just another pretty face (her performance was first rate) and Alan Arkin was real creepy.  From this to the In-Laws, the guy can act.  But as far as this movie goes, freaking amazing.  Watch it with the lights out."
61,5.0,"Disclaimer- I have not seen the Big Top Edition, I have the 60th Anniversary edition.  This is a review of the film.

It is amazing that this film was made 65 years ago.  This bright, crisp, colorful film with it's excellent soundtrack and music is just captivating.  My 3-year old is currently fixated with ""Gumbo""-- meaning that this is the DVD that will be in the single disc rotation for the next couple weeks or so.

Yes the crows are incredibly non-PC, and that is the one place where the film shows it's age-- but that just adds to the film now.  It isn't like a child would ever pick up on the racial overtones of the crows without a frame of reference.

One sequence that is still freaking me out is the Pink Elephants on parade sequence.  I guess I am a little surprised this is from 1940; some of the things like the reference to Technicolor I would never have thought would be from the 40s.  And the morphing and dancing elephants sequence seemed like it would have belonged more in a 60s acid movie than in a 40s kids cartoon.  If the hippies had DVD they would have loved tripping out to that.

But all in all this is a nearly perfect movie, but one that might get overlooked my many parents who are picking up Nemo, Cars, or Aladdin.  Don't overlook this movie."
62,5.0,"While Tim Burton's rather shameless breakdancing ripoff of The Looking Glass Wars and American McGee's Alice has been shaking up the box office, you cannot deny the classic visual ecstacy of the 1951 Disney animated movie. I'm really suprised that Disney didn't bother giving the live-action sequal/reboot a different title, at least to seperate it from the original. Although the more recent film seemed like Disney was just rehashing their Return To Oz premise but with Lewis Carroll's work. But, it is still impossible not to enjoy their classic first shot at it.

Taking place in England(probably in the late-19th Century), young Alice is bored out her mind listening to her sister trying to teach her history. She then follows a slightly anthropomorphic White Rabbit down a hole, but instead of ending up in Bugs Bunny's place, she enters a ""dimension of sight and sound"". After having emotional problems with a chatty doorknob, she washes up on the shores of Wonderland. She's then thrust into a caucas race, forced into a dream sequence by pushy twins, wrecks the Rabbit's house, and gets pestered by pushy flowers, all while having some serious height issues. Fortunately, a poetic caterpillar gives her some good mushrooms(?), and Alice manages to stabilize her size. The enigmatic Cheshire Cat then leads her to the highlight of the movie, the Mad Tea Party(you can't not love the Doormouse freaking out!). After a little more wandering around amongst the bizarre forest animals, Alice does something that most Disney heroines do, and realizes that her own world was better after all, and decides to try and get home. The Cheshire Cat shows up again and leads her to the loudmouthed Queen of Hearts who has a serious decaptiation fetish. Instead of getting her head chopped off, Alice is given the weirdest trial outside of Judge Judy. She then proceeds into the craziest Benny Hill-styled chase in animated film history, and wakes up because the whole thing was just a dream(or was it?).

For the lucky 13th of Disney's full-length cartoon movies, this broke alot of molds for them. First off, it was actually a meltdown of more than one book, while being mostly from the Alice In Wonderland book, there are segments from Through The Looking Glass too, but they manage to bring it together in a coherent way, which is suprising considering the source material. The other great aspect of it was their use of allowing the visual elements and music tell most of the story. It was to date their most colorful and lively animated movie to be released, only succeeded by Sleeping Beauty. While it isn't out to ram some overly-Christian morals down your children's throats like most Disney films, it remains as fun family feature, and one of the best cartoons to get totally stoned to!"
63,3.0,"I am a huge Bret Easton Ellis fan so rightfully so I was appauled at the way this film destroyed his novella of the same name.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a terrible movie...I still gave it 3 stars, but if they had called it something else instead of passing it off as an adaptation I would have given it 4 or 5.  The problem is that they don't just take libertys, they change the story completly. Here are a few (just a few) of the reasons I feel the film was destroyed.

SPOILER ALERT FOR BOTH THE NOVEL AND THE FILM!!!

First off, Clay (McCarthy) does drugs in the novel, and lots of them.  He has no moral code, no ""Let's help Julian""...No, Julian is his dealer and thats all.

Second...there was no affair between Julian (Downey Jr.) and Blair (Gertz), and even if there was, Clay wouldn't have cared because he was always strung out on coke and sleeping with somebody else.  They didn't care about boyfriend, girlfriend crap.  Clay would have probably joined in had he found Julian in bed with Blair.

Third, the fact that they changed arounf who pimped who in order to spare less extras is fine, but by changing Rips (Spaders) charactor so much they never explore what made him tick as far as the novel is concerned.  One of the most memerable scenes in the novel involves Rip and his friends raping a young girl, and although that may have been to graphic a scene for 80's film it was a defining moment in realizing who Rip was.

Fourth, and a BIG fourth...Julian never died in the novel.  There was no tragic ending, no morale issue to contend with.  That scene was added to place a moral code, to place a reason to remember the film.  It was a banner saying ""DON'T DO DRUGS"" but what the producer and director failed to realize is that ""Less than Zero"" is not an anti-drug novel.  It does not have a point, it's just there...and that's what makes it so freaking brilliant.  If they had left it alone, and made the movie that should have been made then they would have had a masterpiece on their hands.

Like I said...this is not terrible.  If they had named this film somthing else, anything else...I don't care if it was ""Don't do Drugs"" or hell, even ""Less than Nothing"" just not ""Less than Zero""...It was just a marketing attempt for some guy with a script about the dangers of drug abuse to get his film made, tagging it onto the coat-tails of a popular book at the time.

Bad move!"
64,3.0,"While it may not have been a victory for the acting world, ""Bloodsport"" was more responsible than any other movie for launching the career of a certain high-kicking, strongly accented Belgian action hero.  ""Bloodsport"" tells the (kind of) true story of Frank Dux, a Franco-American army officer who goes AWOL in order to honor his Japanese master by fighting in a secret full-contact tournament called the Kumite.  Along the way, he gets busy with a leggy American reporter and befriends a hulking fellow competitor (played by Donald Gibb, best known as Ogre from the ""Revenge Of The Nerds"").  Of course, Van Damme movies are not known for their moral ambiguity, and this one is no exception.  The bad guy role in this particular film goes to Chong Li (played by the very imposing Bolo Yeung), who is, in the grand tradition of Van Damme movie villains, PURE AND UNMITIGATED EVIL.  He intentionally cripples (or kills) his opponents, taunts Van Damme after beating up his friend, and generally looks mean and scary.  You just know Van Damme and Chong Li are going to meet in the finals (isn't it just a major coincidence that they're on opposite sides of the bracket?), so suspense goes pretty much out the window right away.  However, things like plot and character devlopment aren't exactly requirements for a Van Damme movie anyway.  What ""Bloodsport"" does offer is frequent fight montages where hard-bodied martial artists do the kinds of things that look really freaking cool even if you can't completely follow what they're doing.  And of course, you get to watch Van Damme dispatch a variety of foes with impossibly fast and limber movements on his way to the championship.  And what else are Van Damme movies for?  Sure, the plot and acting are negligible, but ""Bloodsport"" stands as a milestone of the mindless action genre.  So shut your brain down for ninety minutes and enjoy."
65,2.0,"JUST FYI THIS HAS NO SUBTITLES FOR THE DEAF, which is against the law in united states. thanks for not letting me enjoy this movie with out Subtitles. seriously! i loved this movie growing up they had CC on the VHS. why no subtitles on a freaking blu-ray!"
66,5.0,"Bette Midler is so funny in this 80's movie, and Lillie Tomlin, I have seen it like a million times. I don't think that many people know about this neglected 80's classic where they are a set of rich & poor twins that grow up and are separated at birth. It is freaking awesome!!!!

They are BOTH soooo funny! The whole movie is so funny and I don't even know how to do a decent job describing Bette playing both a total hick & a rich Behotch, and Lillie Tomlin doing the SAME. Plus, huge sets, a stellar cast, costumes, music, and... it's a gem!

If I was a Hollywood producer I would totally remake this and also recast both ladies in cameos as Grandmas to the younger versions of themselves. LOL! God I am so awesome and smart. AHAHAHAH"
67,4.0,"Although some of the special effects have not aged too well, DeepStar Six (1989) is a still a solidly entertaining sea monster movie, that unfolds like classic science fiction from the 50's, as an unknown creature is released from an undersea cavern.  Directed by Sean S. Cunningham (Friday The 13th, A Stranger Is Watching), and co-executive produced by Mario Kassar (Terminator 2, Cliffhanger), the film has pretty good production values.

DeepStar Six is a government run underwater facility, whose unlikely task is to locate a suitable site for a missile platform.  The craft Seacat is ordered by to set off an explosive charge to prepare a prospective site for use.  The explosion releases an unknown creature, from a cavern below.  The creature is attracted to light, and extremely fast, and quickly takes out Seacat.  The remote station Seatrack is the next victim, and is in danger of falling off a shelf, after being struck repeatedly by the creature.  Mini-sub DSRV2 links up to Seatrack, and manages to rescue survivors, just before it topples from the shelf.  Returning to DeepStar Six, the remaining crew regroups and is preparing to depart for the surface, when yet another catastrophe strikes, and they finally come face to face with the monster.

There are some far- fetched aspects, but the overall story holds together fairly well, and moves along briskly.  One result of keeping the monster so completely under wraps, is that DeepStar Six seems more like a disaster movie, where bad things just keep happening, rather than a true monster movie.  There isn't anything solid for the audience to fear, so is difficult for any level of suspense to build up.

The underwater exteriors and shots featuring models, probably weren't that impressive when the film was originally released, and now looking severely dated, are something of a distraction.  Fortunately the interior sets are more modern and realistic, although the design of the underwater facilities are extremely prone to flash flooding.  When the monster finally appears, it looks like something from an Irwin Allen production.  Ugly, and not too mobile, it's hard to imagine that this creature is capable of great speed.  The film seems to make the most out of the beast's brief appearances.

The cast may not have any big stars, but even those in minor roles do a very good job here.  We get a quick impression of the characters in everyday life, before they are plunged into crisis.  Their interaction and the dialog seems mostly believable, and not too clichd.  Captain Laidlaw (Taurean Blacque) is in charge of the operation, Dr. Van Gelder (Marius Weyers) the expert on underwater facilities and missile, and Dr. Norris (Cindy Pickett) the medical officer.  Also in the crew are Scarpelli (Nia Peeples), Jim Richardson (Matt McCoy), Snyder (Miguel Ferrer), Burciaga (Elya Baskin), McBride (Greg Evigan) and Joyce Collins (Nancy Everhard).

Greg Evigan, is still mostly known for the TV series BJ and the Bear, is pretty good here as McBride, one of the crew forced to assume leadership.  McBride is romantically involved with Joyce Collins, who similarly has to step it up.  Nia Peeples as Scarpelli, provides words of caution and background information, before the disaster strikes.  When put to the test, the crew functions and adapts fairly well under pressure (with one exception).  Miguel Ferrer steals much of the spotlight as Snyder, a tech in a key position, who gradually falls completely apart.  Between setting off an explosion that critically damages the station, to accidentally killing a colleague, to totally freaking out, it is just a really bad day for Snyder.

Although some of the special effects are weak, and the logic flawed, DeepStar Six is still a pretty entertaining undersea adventure.  The monster isn't a major visual factor until near the end, but the tightly written script, and crisply executed action sequences, keeps things interesting until you get there."
68,5.0,"The film, although it received mixed critical reviews, was obviously thought of highly enough by Soviet authorities because, after initially not wanting to release it, they did, but refused its entry into film festivals like Venice of Cannes, for fear that it would win, and thus draw more attention to Tarkovsky's non-agitprop works. The irony is that, had Tarkovsky, and other artists, been allowed to pursue their art unfettered, it would have reflected all the greater on the Soviet system. Having seen earlier and later films of his, I can say that The Mirror is likely Tarkovsky's best film- not a perfect film, but a great film, and easily. Earlier works culminated in this, while later works stole from it. Tarkovsky, himself, wrote this, in his memoirs: `(the film) has demonstrated to me, again, how well founded my conjecture about the importance of personally experienced emotion was in telling a story onscreen. Perhaps cinema is the most personal art, the most intimate. In cinema only the author's intimate truth will be convincing enough for the audience to accept.' In actuality, cinema is second, in that regard, to poetry; but then cinema is closer to poetry than any other art in giving its creator an almost God-like ability over time and space. However, its visual element does make it more accessible to many than poetry; if not more intimate.

  The biggest critical boner about the film, however, seems to be the idea that the lead character, Alexei, dies in the film, or that the film is about his death, in either memory or toto. Yet, this simply is not a sustainable claim because, as mentioned earlier, the scene in which Alexei supposedly `dies,' is done in a blackly comic sort of way- with two old babushkas kvetching about Alexei possibly dying, even though he may only have strep throat. Yet, by virtue of the images of his memory we have seen to that point, Alexei clearly embellishes to a point of heightened reality, in the least, and melodrama, at most. Therefore, if he is the source of the claim of impending death, it is suspect. Clearly the two babushkas are not credible sources since they seem puzzled by the claim. The so-called doctor in the scene seems not too concerned, either. Likely, Alexei is hypochondriacal. The other pillar for the claim of death is when we see Alexei grip and release a small bird upward in the air. First, the image is so trite, and obviously so, that Tarkovsky, if this was his intent, made an error in judgment that is very bad, for it thuds the film flat. Instead, given the absurdity of the scene, this is likelier Alexei's own melodramatic tendencies coming to the fore again, and him trying to paint an end to the scene, not his life, for Alexei does, at times in the film, seem to break the fourth wall in his recall. Also, the bird does not fly free from Alexei's dead hand. His hand heaves up and releases the bird. It's a toss- a thing that would not occur in a last gesture. Given these visual certainties, the far likelier scenario is that, perhaps, this may be the present state of the film, with Alexei `s memory the rest of the film to that point. The end, with his mother's learning of her pregnancy with him, is just Andrei's exclamation point after the melodrama with the bird. Or, as I stated earlier, the whole film may be a flashforth with a return to the present of his mother at the `start' of his life.

  On the flip side, there are several good scenes that stand out narratively and have other import. The best is the dig at Stalinism and censorship when we see Alexei's mom freaking out over a possible typographical error at her job. She clearly fears staining her record, and the consequences that may bring. That this worry is compounded by the overt aggression of her co-worker makes for a scene where personal and professional ills collide convincingly, and the scene ends in a shower, where she relieves her stress by laughing. During the dummy grenade scene, when the drill instructor pounces on the grenade, we see his fear reflected in the pulses of his forehead where skull has clearly been removed- likely in a shrapnel explosion. It is eerie, realistic, and memorable. There is a scene where we see spilt milk and the odd coalescence of milk on a floor, or in the scene where Ignat reads Pushkin's letter aloud, then returns after opening the door, to find her gone. It seems a dream, except we see a moist condensation stain that evaporates on the wooden table, suggesting it was `real.' This scene prefigures similar scenes of ghosts in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, just five years later.

  But, then, in a sense, Alexei may or may not be a ghost- a possible person, or a past person. Certainly he embodies his nation, and the film is not wholly from his point of view. There are scenes, such as parts of the dummy grenade scene or when his mother frets over a possible typo, that simply cannot have been known by Alexei, unless he is more than just a human character- perhaps an amalgam of persons and idea(l)s absorbed by his surroundings. After all, early on the doctor tells his mother that some believe that plants have senses of perception. Similarly, some of the newsreels used in the film make no sense, as they are, nor in the context of the film, until one considers that not all memories make sense. Things rarely make sense in a fugue, anyway, and that's what The Mirror is- a visual fugue on thought and memory, and a great one. Compare it to any of David Lynch's similarly posited films, and Tarkovsky's film's superiority is manifest, for Lynch's films are piffle, in contrast. From literary references (Chekhov's Ward No. 6) to historical context to self-referentiality (a scene where a film poster of Tarkovsky's own Andrei Rublev hangs) to visual sleight of hand to characterization by accumulation, The Mirror succeeds as a great film by simultaneously being as large as everything while focusing on the trivia of life that one rarely recalls. Yet, the film never bores, it invites rewatch to re-trigger memories of it and one's own. Rare is the trigger that is also a bullet. Bang!"
69,3.0,"Donald Pleasence gets his name above the title in ""Halloween 5."" After turning in brilliant performances in such noteworthy films as ""Halloween"" and, um, ""Halloween II,"" he finally got his due with ""Halloween 5."" Surely upon being told the news, he retired to his trailer and drank bourbon until he passed out.

(I don't know if Donald Pleasence was really an alcoholic or not. But looking at him, I can't imagine him being anything else. He face looks genetically predisposed to being pressed against a barroom floor.)

The posters for this movie called it ""Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers,"" but the onscreen title is simply ""Halloween 5,"" which is good, since Michael doesn't really get revenge on anybody in it. Kills some folks, sure, but they're mostly strangers, not people he had vendettas against. In fact, the two people he would have the most reason to kill -- Dr. Loomis and little Jamie -- are the two people he DOESN'T murder. ""Halloween 5: The Failure of Michael Myers"" would be more accurate, though admittedly not as appealing in a mass-marketing sense.

After an opening credit sequence featuring a pumpkin being carved -- an act the filmmakers seemed to think we would find scary -- and after a few minutes of clips from ""Halloween 4,"" we are brought to the present day: Halloween Eve 1989. Even though Part 4 ended with Jamie -- the young niece of Michael Myers -- becoming evil and apparently the New Michael, now, a year later, she's just a disturbed child who can't talk (hooray!) and who's being kept in a home for creepy children. Why isn't Jamie evil after all? I dunno. Apparenly, Part 4 was only kidding about that.

She does have a psychic connection with Uncle Mike, though, and can tell when people are in danger of him. Also, a lot of townspeople THINK she's evil, and they throw rocks through her window with notes attached to them that say, ""The evil child must die!"" Just add that to the pile of terrible, terrible things that happen to this girl in the interest of traumatizing her beyond the point of humanity. I would not be surprised if both the character and the actress who played her later turned to a career in pornography. In fact, I would be disappointed if they didn't. (The actress, Danielle Harris, did go on to appear in ""Urban Legends,"" which is sort of the same thing.)

Jamie's foster parents are out of town this weekend, but she's safe and warm at the creepy children's hospital, under the disquieting care of half-melted Dr. Loomis (played by the aforementioned Mr. Pleasence). Loomis is pretty frustrated with the fact that Jamie can't talk and help him find Michael; how he knows Michael is even still alive is beyond me, since Michael died at the end of Part 4.

Michael is still alive, of course; he swam down a river and then stumbled into a shack belonging to an old man, whom he killed (but not before taking a nap). It is unclear when this takes place. We see him escaping the mine shaft he fell into at the end of Part 4, and we see him swimming down a river. Then he enters the shack and passes out, exhausted from the chase. This all happened moments after the events of Part 4, right? Right, except that then it's a year later and Jamie's in the hospital having psychic connections with Michael ... who is still in the shack, where no time seems to have elapsed. The shack exists in a wormhole, apparently, the Shack That Time Forgot.

Anyhoo, somehow Dr. Loomis figures out Michael must still be alive -- probably all the freaking out Jamie does clues him in -- and wants to catch him, and the police cooperate but are really, really stupid and do more harm than good, adding more weight to the argument that we shouldn't even HAVE police in this country.

Jamie's foster sister Rachel, left over from the last movie, gets killed before long by Michael Myers, who doesn't even bother hiding anymore. He pretty much just stands around where anyone could see him, often in broad daylight, and yet no one sees him. You'd think a town that had been victimized just a year earlier by a Halloween-themed serial killer would be more alert on the anniversary of it. You'd especially think Rachel would be on her toes and not in the shower all the time, considering she was one of Michael's primary targets last year. But who am I to judge? No one's ever tried to kill me with a knife. Maybe I'd pretend it never happened, too.

Anyway, Rachel gets killed, which is fine with me, but her replacement as heroine is her annoying `80s friend Tina, a bedenimed vixen with a loathsome boyfriend and an even loathsomer fashion sense. Because she is the most irritating person on the face of the earth, in the perverse sense of justice employed by these movies, she is destined to live until the movie is almost over.

Michael seems to have killing Jamie as his goal, but he is easily distracted from it. He comes upon a Halloween party attended by randy teens (""Friday the 13th"" was on its Part 8 by now; the ""Halloween"" folks obviously had been watching and taking notes), where he decides he ought to kill all of them, all of them, I tell you! How he thinks this will help him kill Jamie, I don't know. Maybe he's just practicing. At any rate, a really blond couple, including a nearly bald teen-age boy, is having sex -- he with his pants on and not even unzipped, don't ask me how -- when Michael skewers them with a pitchfork. You like to see that happen. I do, anyway.

Loomis has it in his head that if Michael kills Jamie, his ""rage"" will be quieted, and he'll stop killing. So he uses the poor girl as bait, back at Michael's childhood home, which has grown into a Victorian mansion. The question is whether she is just bait to lure Michael there so they can kill him, or whether the insane Loomis actually plans to deliver her up to her murderous uncle. There are hints of good filmmaking in all that.

Another hint of quality comes with a mysterious dark figure who lurks around the movie and in the end busts Michael out of jail. It is merely a hint, though, as it is not resolved in this film, and it is patently unfair to introduce such major plot points solely for the purpose of setting up a sequel."
70,4.0,"I was kind of disappointed with this movie. There was a REALLY great cliffhanger ending at the end of pt. 4 that could have been used so well in this movie that was just completely ignored. Instead, Michael comes back to do his routine and to stalk his now-mute niece. True, this isn't a very bad film. The directing style is really good. The movie actually feels like it is Halloween. Of course, it's typical 80's slasher, so if you hate that, you'll hate this. I hated almost every character in this movie, especially Tina, so this was the first time I found myself cheering Michael on. There is a minor subplot of Michael and some guy in a black coat following him around (Watch pt. 6) that should have, in my opinion, been left out of the movie. And what is up with the Myer's house? I'm not the only one who noticed how big this place has gotten since the first movie! In the original it was just a regular looking house, like you or I would live in. In this one, it's a freaking mansion! But flaws aside, Halloween 5 is good slasher fun. Just turn off your brain during viewing and you'll be just fine."
71,1.0,"Maybe it was a good movie for the time it came out.  But I don't get it.  Cause it was not just cheesy special effects.  The little girl was just freaking creepy.  And the story was ""meh"" at best."
72,5.0,"The premise behind this film is brilliant. It cleverly weds two disparate and apparently unrelated segments of 1960's-70's culture in an endlessly fascinating and endlessly provocative way: the hippie/new age counterculture & the world of new technologies. In the cultural moment when this film was made, these two segments of society were at odds. Most countercultural movements were anti-technology and prescribed a return to nature while the new technologies presented the possibility of an escape from nature into a wholly man-made, genetically engineered, and virtually governed, reality. In our own postmodern moment, this battle between nature and tecnology seems to have been won by technology, but the resurgent green movement gives this film renewed relevance.

Granted, this film has some serious problems. In some ways the film appears to be a kind of reactionary backlash against the women's movement. It doesn't take a mastermind to see that John Boorman, the films writer & director, is arguing against what he perceives to be the feminizing trends in western civilization. And that the problem with the ""utopia"" presented in the film is that it is run by women and feminized men. Wow!!! Talk about a hairy-knuckled script, but thats why this ride is so bloody fun. However problematic politically, this resurgent primitivism is one of this films lasting appeals.

Boorman's cure for this ailing utopia's ills: The woman-hitting Sean Connery, of course. Once he comes to town (vortex) to knock some sense into all of these feminine & feminized utopian subjects all will be returned to bloody, very bloody, male-dominated normalcy.

Did Norman Mailer write this script?

The political wrong-headedness is just one of this films many allures.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The story:

Sometime in the past (judging from the outfits, probably sometime in 1969) some ""great"" (or ""mad"") scientists set out to create the perfect society. Lucky for the scientists, the world was falling apart just as they finished their ambitious biosphere and so humanity, or at least a select portion of it, was easily seduced into climbing aboard. The older scientists promise the youth culture eternal youth (and what could be more perfect than that for a narcissistic blonde neo-crypto fascist collective?). Once they enter the biosphere called the vortex, however, there are rules, serious new age rules, and so the vortex is really not so much a utopia after all, but a freaking cult! And members have to abide by the cult's strict no individual consciousness rule or they are penalized with aging ( any assertion of individual thought or feeling is seen as an act of rebellion against the new order and the penalty is, well, getting older ). The youth cult's titular leader is an impish Magritte-loving magician named, appropriately, after a children's fantasy book. But the real leader is the super-computer Tabernacle that preserves the past, but only as dead knowledge with no relevance for the new order of new beings, and whose real function is to regulate the new age present. Oh yes, and Tabernacle, somehow, communicates telepathically with cult members via crystals (evey cult member wears a crystal ring). Another bit of genius!!

The leader Zardoz really has no powers per se, like most cult leaders he simply knows how to manipulate minds. He is basically the Dale Carnegie or Jim Jones or David Karesh of this utopia.

But, as always, there is trouble in paradise. Both from rebellious elements within and without this new age compound.

For in the outlands surrounding the hermetically sealed vortex, barbarian tribes, leftovers from the old world, still roam in masculine splendor, raping and pillaging all the peace-loving mortals. And all is sanctioned by Zardoz (to the barabrians Zardoz is a big stone godhead that hovers over them--but, of course, Zardoz is really just a fancy rock ship piloted by the impish magician), who the barabarians in their masculine egotism perceive as a God that loves them and cares for their souls. What they failt to see is that all that Zardoz really wants is an all-out genocide. Zardoz wants all trace of the barabrians to be erased, only then will Zardoz's takeover of reality be complete.

The surprise: Sean Connery as Zed is not only a masculine thunderbolt with a gun, he's a reader.  And once he figures out that Zardoz is just a trickster like David Blaine or Criss Angel or political figure of your choice and not a real god, he's determined to penetrate the secret lair of the faux god and unmask the hoax once and for all. Ok, he wants that and he wants to invade the oppressive exploitative vortex and kill everyone inside (all except, of course, the beautiful Charlotte Rampling with whom he wants to start a new race of his own --a righteous race of good old barbaric beings that will turn humanity back to its old recognizably natural, mortal self and horizons once again). And he succeeds brilliantly!

As awesome as that plot is, the plot is not really the thing; its the ride that counts, and as cinematic amusement park rides go, this one is full of new age hilarity and more camp than you can shake a crystal at.

Connery looking like someone's scary new age dad, or a Burning Man refugee, is unbeatable!

But, honestly, the film keeps you thinking the whole time, and the visuals, riotous & campy as they are, are strangely stimulating & irresistable.

No other utopian/dystopian film is this much fun."
73,2.0,"Sometimes Cannon came across like Roger Corman with a slightly bigger budget.  Like Corman, Cannon had no gripes about making low budget ripoffs of big budget blockbusters.  We see that tradition carried on today by The Asylum.
  With Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, Cannon continues the Indiana Jones ripoffage that started with King Solomon's Mines two years prior.  That movie was quite campy, unapologetic and silly, but at least it had it's own bad movie entertainment value.  This sequel(shot at the same time as King Solomon's Mines) doesn't have that.  Sure, it tries here and there, but fails a lot more than it succeeds.
  As the title suggests, Quatermain is now on the search for the Lost City of Gold, not so much for riches, but to find his brother.  Along for the ride is Jesse(now his fiancee), axe wielding warrior Umslopogaas, and sleazy ""holy man"", Swarma.  After one of the shortest desert treks ever filmed, they find city, and Quatermain's brother is alive and well, living there with a group of folks who remind me of the Eloi from the Time Machine.  Naturally, the city is being ruled with an iron(or gold?) fist by an evil priest and his sexy, mute henchwoman(played by Elvira herself!).  Quatermain and friends lead the people in a revolt, and......aw, hell, you know who comes out the winner here.
  This could have been a fun movie, but it's rather boring and kinda painful to watch.  Sharon Stone returns in the hysterical, irritating Kate Capshaw role.  I never understood Hollywood's philosophy on the concept of the female lead that's constantly screaming, freaking out, whining, and dispatching enemies through clumsiness and stupidity.  This stereotypical female character showed up in so many movies in the 80s, and what seemed like every Jackie Chan movie in the 90s.  Was there a poll taken to see if audiences liked this sort of character?  Were the people demanding this kind of character?  Have you ever met one person that likes this sort of character???  But if that weren't bad enough, we now have Robert Donner as Swarma.  Swarma is another type of character nobody likes or asks for in their adventure films, yet we get him all the same.  Swarma is the cowardly weasel character that is supposed to be comic relief, yet instead of making you laugh(or even crack a smile), he makes you wish nothing but a horrible and painful death to remove him from the film.  Again, who asks for this kind of character?  Even after throwing his companions under the bus, he's never given the boot!  Robert Donner has always seemed  to land these kinds of parts.  Hey, it can be done well from time to time.  Look at Joe Pesci's character in the Lethal Weapon films for an example of how it can be done right.
  Then we have Richard Chamberlain returning as Quartermain.  You can't put too much blame on him because here he's basically a decent actor in a not so decent movie.
  Character actor Henry Silva, usually very reliable as a villain, is wasted.  Here he makes for one of the most uninteresting and least threatening villains you'll ever see.  Tis a shame.
  So, in a movie jam packed with unimpressive characters and performances stands the only person with any redeeming value, and that's James Earl Jones as the warrior, Umslopogaas(yes, I had to copy and paste that name because it wasn't worth the time or effort to memorize the spelling).  Umslopogaas(did it again) is the macho, brawny warrior who says little and wields a big axe.  It's a role totally beneath James' talents, and I've heard that Jones isn't exactly proud of having been in the film either.  Be that as it may, he's the most fun to watch, mainly because he's James Earl Jones, and James Earl Jones is just about one of the top ten coolest people on the planet.  James Earl Jones reading the ingredients off of a box of Lucky Charms over the phone would be entertaining-and certainly more entertaining than about 45 minutes of this film.
  Ultimately, this movie tried to capture what little thrill the first film provided and pretty much failed.  Rubber creatures, bad one liners, a lost city, a big battle, jungle hijinx, human sacrifice, a guy named Umslopogaas(had to do it one more time) .... it should have all worked somehow, but it just didn't.  It's schlocky, but just not the right kind of schlock to be entertaining."
74,4.0,"The sheer amount of one star reviews gurgling about animal cruelty is just ridiculous!

First of all there is no such thing as the ""AMERICAN HUMAN SOCIETY"" so anyone saying such an organization claims that at least 29 Milos died is just allowing themselves to be misled! The American HumanE Society has never released any such statement, in fact, they have not even reviewed Milo and Otis at all! If you want to argue with me about this then find me the review!
here is a video review from Ebert and Roeper in which they further debunks these statements:

[...]

Anyone who keeps going on and on about how such technology did not exist in 1986 therefore logically concluding that cruelty must have occurred: unless you have studied film making and the history of film making or are a professional in the industry, you cannot make such claims, you really have no proof at all except your own opinions!

For everyone crying about the bear brutalizing Otis: Masanori Hata has interviewed with journalist Margo Kaufman of Pug World and stated that the bear cub and the Otis puppy used in that scene had been raised together and were friends. In that scene they were just playing and messing around.

About the cliff: I have so far seen people describe this cliff as 200ft, 100ft, 50ft, 20ft and 10ft! People are just sitting around making up numbers! No one has any actual proof about how tall the cliff was. No one has proof about whether the cat chose to jump or was tossed and whether the cat jumped off of that particular cliff or if the image of the cat jumping was edited or whatnot. no one has proof whether cats died. people are literally sitting around, making things up working themselves up into an outraged state and then screaming about it on the internet!

For the people who say that the 'no animals were harmed' tag is missing: I'm not a lawyer for this Milo and Otis movie and I don't know what the tagging standards are for animal movies. it is possible that they did not include this tag because two animals WERE indirectly harmed/killed. The fish Milo catches with his tail and the field mouse that the owl grabs. And possibly the scene where milo is messing with he crab and his cheek gets pinched. it is wrong to assume that 10/20/29 milos died and 9-20 otises drowned just because of a missing tag. You must do actual research, call Fuji Television Network, call Columbia Pictures, call Masanori Hata, call Mark Saltzman, call the American Humane Society! Don't just rely on some nitwits freaking out on the internet and for goodness sakes don't keep propagating unverified rumors!

If you have not done research and have actual proof you should not be running around writing things like this because it will ruin the movie for other people! When I first heard 20 Milos were killed I was devastated! Imagine how many other people are being hurt and hating this movie because of rumors like this?

The only reason why I am not giving this DVD 5 stars is because I wanted to see the original 90 minute Japanese version and it is not included in this disk, nor is there a Japanese track or subtitles."
75,2.0,"It's true.  Just about everyone likes the old movie better, back when it was just called ""Star Wars.""  I hate how I can say ""Star Wars"" now and some people have to ask ""Which Episode?""  It's freaking STAR WARS!!!  It's not ""Episode IV: A New Hope,"" but STAR WARS, end title.

If and only if you own this DVD release or the 2004 release, I invite you to use your internets to google the word ""Adywan.""  You will be pleasantly surprised."
76,3.0,"After finally watching this, the quality of video is fairly decent, it's of course an improvement to the THX VHS tapes that came out back in, I think, 1996 BEFORE the special edition BS came out.

However, I'm sorely hacked how HUGE the letterbox is.  My god.  I have other versions that are older than Star Wars that doesn't have this big of a letterbox.  It's every bit as big as the letterbox from the original VHS version.

I think that is an annoyance.  This is because really this is not that much different than the VHS tapes.  It is merely a convenience for those who don't have VCRs anymore.

Yes, it's about freaking time Lucas released these original movies.  Don't give me that BS that there aren't anymore copies of the original and how Lucasfilms ""exhaustively"" searched the vault just to make the movie.  That's the biggest lie I've ever heard.

There is no way Lucas would EVER destroy completely the original copy.  Furthermore, there isn't just ONE copy of the original 3 movies existing.  Sorry, I will never believe that.  There were copies made straight after production.  It's standard for any major motion picture.

It's a good purchase for those who want the DVD version of Star Wars, but really with the exception that it is a bit better version (not as grainy) as the VHS version, it's no different.

God...that letterbox...I realize that they didn't make it 16:9.  But for crying out loud, the letterbox is unnecessarily too big.  I know they could have reduced the letterbox at least by 1/4.  Right now on my screen, Chewbacca is perhaps 16 or 17 inches tall on a 34"" widescreen TV.

I dont' care about getting 5.1 surround sound or better quality of video.  Just reduce the letterbox a bit."
77,5.0,"If you're buying this, you already know the plot so I won't bore you with a review of that. Instead, the good stuff.
An absolutely PERFECT blend of horror and comedy. I honestly cannot think of any other film that pulled it off so well. Unlike George Romero's zombie trilogy, ""Return of the Living Dead"", written/directed by Dan O'Bannon, it didn't take itself seriously. It had FUN. It never dragged, zipping you from one moment of dread to another and when it got too gory or intense, O' Bannon brought in the laughs. Not slapstick but genuine, over-the-top gags. Whether it be a hungry zombie asking to ""send more cops"" as if he was ordering pizza or the bumbling warehouse employees who, after accidentally releasing a toxic gas that re-animates corpses, find that killing zombies by destroying the brains doesn't work. When they finally exclaim ""WELL IT WORKED IN THE MOVIES!"" you know the rules have been thrown out the window.
The film works on so many levels of gore and humor and the fact that it makes fun of itself and Romero's classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" come off as more self-aware than Wes Craven's ""Scream"" films of the 90's.
The film took it's chances and could've angered fans of Romero's original by actually referring to that movie within the first few minutes, saying it was all fictional and that ""what really happened was..."" well you get the idea. In fact, O'Bannon tried as hard as possible to make his film as different from Romero's. You see, O'Bannon's zombies could RUN after you, could think and plan ways to get at you, they could TALK to you and tell you what part they wanted to eat from you......""BRAINS!""
The film's punk rock soundtrack is excellent. Dare I say ""goth punk""? Sure it fit in with the punk characters that got stuck in the horror but the tone of the songs fit in so well with the movie.
 The cast was superb, all somehow finding the perfect way to play their parts. There isn't a single 'off' performance. Frank's over-the-top ""freaking out"", Burt's calm ""this is what we're gonna do"" attitude and Freddy's realization of what's happening to his body and mind all showcase the talent that made the film work.
When one of our heroes (who's been zombiefied) commits suicide by burning himself ""alive"" in the crematorium....it's not horrific but truly sad. Actor James Karen embodied 'Frank' with such an ""every guy"" quality, you couldn't help but feel for him. Thom Mathews played ""Freddy"". A new level was added to the zombie genre. We see a young man, full of life with lots of partying left to do, slowly get snuffed out. He was exposed to the gas you see and he's slowly dying.....yet already dead. He's conscious while feeling rigor mortis setting in.....and he describes every pain to you. It's unsettling. Clu Gulager plays the warehouse owner 'Burt' (his best friend who owns the funeral home next door? Ernie. Nope, not kidding!) who seemingly dead pans throughout the entire film. While the entire film is going crazy, he is the constant throughout and you feel that if you were in the same situation, you'd want him there helping to make crucial decisions. Linnea Quigley, the ""B-movie scream Queen"" plays 'Trash'. Her infamous, FULL FRONTAL strip tease has left many of my fellow 20-something's with fond memories of their childhood.
This film parodied it's sub-genre of horror YEARS before the junk that was the ""Scream"" trilogy. It also managed to be FAR scarier than Wes Craven's poor attempts which basically amounted to a ""Boo!"" a 9 year old attempts on Halloween. Dan O'Bannon, the film's writer/director (partly responsible for the classic ""Alien"") created a film that, in every way, perfectly blended horror and humor. I'm not saying it's the first, I'm saying it's the first at *doing it right.*
 O'Bannon saw the genre in a way most could not. Treat it's subject with respect yet realize, this is incredibly silly. O'Bannon's script is self-aware yet understands it's fictional world is very real. We get the humor, the film's characters aren't so lucky.
The film goes the opposite of what you'd expect in such a subtle way. The hapless humans are caged in places normally associated with the dead (a funeral home, a medical supply warehouse) whereas the dead are free to roam around in the land of the living. Subtle. This is NOT a ""dumb"" film at all (as some uneducated people might mistake ""zombie"" films for.) It's an ironic, horrific, campy and witty take on a classic horror genre. A film I can watch over and over again and never get bored.
As for the DVD itself, MGM has remastered the film from the original negative ensuring a pristine print. The sound has not only been remastered but some sound FX have been ""enhanced"" or completely redone by O'Bannon. The soundmix is in mono which is prefered by O'Bannon. Both full screen and widescreen versions are available. An audio commentary is on the disc featuring O'Bannon and production designer William Stout. Other extras include a featurette called ""Designing the Dead"", a stills gallery of the movie's artwork and the theatrical trailer. Great movie, superb video/audio and some decent extras all for a LOW price!
MGM has said if this disc sells well, a ""director's cut"" will be released.
 After almost a decade of being unavailable, the dead have come back to life!"
78,1.0,"There were so many bad things about this movie. The acting was Horrible! The film quality was so bad, and it was freaking Boring!!"
79,5.0,"This is the first episode and a great start to the series!

Cliff Robertson  plays Allan Maxwell, a radio station engineer for KXKVI who is using all the power of the station for his own purposes of discovering something important. Even though his family feels that he is wasting his time on something dangerous, Allan is convinced that he will be successful. His hard work is paid off when he is able to establish contact with an alien being. He communicates with the alien and they talk about human features, death, and God. However, Allan has to leave the station to attend a party on his honor, and tells the new DJ Eddie Phillips (played by Bert Metcalfe), not to turn the power up in any way. But, Eddie wants his voice to be heard everywhere, so he turns up the power. Due to this, the alien is transported into Earth, where it unintentionally starts creating chaos for the citizens of that town.

The main reason why I liked this episode so much is because it gives a simple message: Don't feel scared about something that is new to you; instead try to understand it. Instead of freaking out by the alien, he decides to communicate with it, and finds that it is harmless. If everyone followed this message (in general situations) even in today's world, we probably wouldn't be having so many problems! Anyway, the special effects for the alien were really good and effective, especially for that time. Cliff Robertson played well as Allan Maxwell.

This entire episode is very interesting, and in the end, it makes you wonder how you would have reacted in such a situation (if one ever came up).

To quote the Galaxy Being: ""There is much you have to learn. You must explore. You much reach out."""
80,5.0,"Why can't they make movies like this anymore ??? ... seems like every freaking movie coming from Hollyweird lately has enough profanity that it makes movies unwatchable - I'm sorry - but - my wife & I have NOT been to a movie since the last James Bond flick came out just because of the nonsense language ... so ... I highly recommend this movie as it's clever - very well written & just a good all around well done movie - the remake - All of Me ... yip - profanity - so I can't recommend that one - this one is wonderfully ""clean"" & just a good all round movie ..."
81,5.0,"Holy freaking crap! I cant believe this is on DVD. This is one of my Favorite childhood movies and storys. If you even remotely like this type of story i recomend the book also! This movie has some of the best classic animation i have seen to date. When i watch this movie, i find myself just staring into the backgrounds which were created with such care and finess. They detail is simply rediculous for the time it came out. The story revolves around a mouse and her family, yeah yeah, its been done before. But this story is a bit deeper then your average kids movie. It really gets you into it, and when the movie ends you are just Itching for more. Fantastic Movie! 5 Stars all the way!

Now as for the dvd and features... well, whats a feature? you might as well just have a vhs, the picture is mildly grainy, like it was a direct copy from vhs, well, a little clearer then that, but still. And theres not a single feature at all. The only ""feature"" on the whole dvd is that you can hit next chapter and have it jump forward.. thats about it."
82,5.0,what can I say its Pink Floyd the cd and the movie are freaking awesome ive always loved it always will
83,2.0,"They've been showing a lot of the Bond films on the Encore channels for the past two months, so I've had a chance to watch almost all of them over again.

YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE has to be my least favorite 007 of the Sean Connery entries.

And Connery looks completely and thoroughly bored for the entire film.  The ""Little Nellie defended her honor"" lines has to be the flattest reading he's ever done.  But nobody cares: it's Sean and he's Bond.

Here's a double feature that might be fun: watch this film and then PARADISE, HAWAIIAN STYLE with Elvis Presley.  Then go around the room and ask for everyone's opinion: which one looked more bored for an entire movie?  James Bond or Elvis Presley.  Could be a whole new party game here.

Some scenes play like they should've been in the dozens of superspy knock-off films of the Sixties: Bond is caught and tied to a chair, menaced by a hot redhead with scalpels--but he seduces her into releasing him, they take off in an airplane, she betrays him and jumps out with a parachute, he frees himself and manages to crash land the plane--WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

The Japanese settings are cool (you can always depend on authentic locales for a Bond film), but the scene where they turn Bond Japanese is laughable: do you really need a surgical room to glue fake eyes onto him?  Can a 6'4"" Scotsman really pass for a Japanese fisherman?

The volcano set was impressive, and it was interesting to finally see the face of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (and his cat freaking out), but this is never the one I pick when I feel like catching a Bond flick.

Connery would come back to play 007 again, largely for laughs, in the campy DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (still a good time), and then in 1983's NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN, because...well, he could."

87,5.0,Classic Costner movie. A freaking win when it comes to the cast and acting.
88,5.0,"Amazingly, I'd never watched this. It's got a sometimes predictable plot, but it's so well done that I didn't mind. Also, as old as this film is, it may have pioneered some of the plots, lol. The characters were likeable and somehow most of the ""main"" characters each got enough screen time for you to care about them. Near the end, it was hard to keep track of who was who when everyone had similar uniforms and the action made it hard to see who it was. Best actor in the group for me was the young Richard(Dickie)Dawson who was freaking adorable as a kilt-wearing Canadian."
89,2.0,I bought this based on memories of wonderful things but it ended up being a disappointment. It has its moments but not a classic. Morticia is freaking awesome though.
90,5.0,"I never really grew up watching the original series, I was familiar with the show every so often catching reruns and the occasional Halloween marathon of episodes.

if you're like me then you were obviously a fan of the motion picture based on this series.  The movies overall enhanced the sense of black humor to the proceedings, and there is still that sense of black humor in the TV series, but bear in mind that it was a TV series from the 60s, and while some things might be somewhat tame or even dated by today's standards, there are others that are quite daring for its time and overall still quite enjoyable today.

for example, it was something of an unspoken rule that a husband and wife on television could not sleep in the same bed or even display any outward affection for each other.  On this show, even though I do not think they've ever shared a kiss, it was quite clear that Gomez and Morticia had a very healthy marriage, in hearing their pet names for each other, seeing them dance together or touch each other affectionately, or in seeing Gomez passionately kiss Morticia's arms up and down whenever she spoke French, it was damn obvious they had a VERY healthy marriage.  But it was also a very effective symbol to married couples, that the passion doesn't necessarily need to die down after two people have gotten married.

Also, the lifestyle of the family in the fact that their interests and hobbies may be seen as abnormal by societial standards, it does give a clear indication that the Addamses weren't afraid to be themselves and more often than not considered the norms and practices of 'ordinary' society to be abnormal.

After all, it's not everyday your child comes running home from school crying her eyes out because she heard a story at school of a dragon being slain by a knight in shining armor.

And let's not beat around the bush, if you're feeling a bit stressed out by life's problems, what better way to relieve stress than to stand on your head for a few hours, or maybe blow up a few model train sets?

Such is the beauty of this show, and why we enjoy watching the Addams clan in all their wonderfully weird and eccentrically entertaining exploits.  I've waited for this show to come out on DVD, and it's about freaking time too.  :)"
91,3.0,"So what happens when you draw two masters of cinematic horror together to each provide their own, particular take on a couple of Edgar Allen Poe stories? Two great tastes that taste great together? Not exactly...but it is kind of fun. Originally titled Due occhi diabolici (1990), and then later called Two Evil Eyes (1991) for the American release, is comprised of two hour long segments. The first, titled ""The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar"", was adapted and directed by George A. Romero (Night of the Living Dead, Martin), and features Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Creepshow), Ramy Zada (After Midnight), Bingo O'Malley (Knightriders, Creepshow), and E.G. Marshall (12 Angry Men, Tora! Tora! Tora!). The second, titled ""The Black Cat"", adapted and directed by Dario `Visconti of Violence' Argento (The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Suspiria), features Harvey Keitel (Reservoir Dogs, The Piano), Madeleine Potter (Slaves of New York), Sally Kirkland (Fatal Games), Martin Balsam (12 Angry Men, Psycho), and John Amos (The Beastmaster, Die Hard 2), probably best known to 1970s television fans as the no nonsense patriarchal figure James Evans, Sr. from the series ""Good Times"".

The movie starts with a short dedication to Poe, including a shot of his grave (or, at least a reasonable facsimile), just so we, the audience, are aware the material featured in this film was stolen...er, I mean, adapted from the works of Edgar Allen Poe. After this we kick into the tale titled ""The Facts in the Case of Mr. Valdemar"". Adrienne Barbeau plays Jessica Valdemar, an older, still highly attractive woman who is currently scheming with her sickly husband's physician, Dr. Robert Hoffman (Ramy), to bilk the her dying husband Ernest (O'Malley) out of as much money as they can, by using hypnosis to get him to sign important documents and such. Well, things go slightly awry after the old codger croaks sooner than expected, so the pair put him in cold storage, namely the freezer in the basement (who's up for some ice cream?) until they can see their plans all the way through. Only thing is, the geezer died while still under hypnosis...so what? Well, it also seems now, besides being a Popsicle, he's stuck between two worlds, that of the living and that of the dead. After Ernest starts vocalizing his predicament and freaking everyone out, Jessica decides to take matters into her own hands, which raises the question how can you kill what's already dead? The next story, titled ""The Black Cat"", features Harvey Keitel as Roderick Usher, a photographer who specializes in still life, often working with the local police documenting gristly crime scenes. Anyway, one day his live-in, witchy woman girlfriend Annabel, played by Potter, brings home a black cat. Well, turns out Roderick and the cat don't get along, as the cat has an unnerving habit of sitting and staring at Roderick. Soon the cat goes missing, Annabel is inconsolable, and Roderick is less than sympathetic. After a bizarre medieval dream sequence, one in which Roderick is punished with a sharpened pole inserted into a very uncomfortable place, the couple's relationship deteriorates quickly, not helped by Roderick's love for the drink, eventually leading to Annabel deciding to split...and split she does when Roderick comes home with a snootful and takes to her with a meat cleaver. After a bit of creative dry walling, Roderick conceals his crime, but the cat, which has since returned, sees all, and remembers even more...

Of the two tales featured here, I enjoyed Argento's more...both include better than expected production values, strong performers, and solid source material, but where Romero's piece seems a little tired and, well, trite, Argento's piece is a bit more substantial, flowing, and visually entertaining (not to mention visceral). I can't help but wonder if perhaps Ms. Barbeau taking one for the team by popping her top would have helped Romero's story...it couldn't have hurt...as far as the story itself, it's sort of similar to that segment titled ""Something to Tide You Over"", featuring Leslie Nielsen and Ted Danson, from the 1982 film Creepshow, as both included a re-animated corpse slumping around, seeking vengeance from those who wronging it prior to it becoming a corpse. The effects are excellent, but the adaptation lacks the punch I was expecting. There did seem a half-hearted effort to create something meaningful between the two main characters, specifically in terms of the pair seeing each other at their worst, and the subsequent effect this had on their relationship (murder's always been a turn off for me), but it never really developed into anything noteworthy. Seems like George had a couple of novel ideas, ones that he then filled in the rest of the story around. The bit at the end was definitely fresh, with the apparitions and the lighting, but not worth the price of admission. E.G. Marshall and Tom Atkins make limited appearances as a lawyer and a police detective, respectively. Argento's piece, on the other hand, comes across a bit stronger, despite the fact it includes an outlandish dream sequence, a tactic I generally despise, as it usually comes off as an effort to pad out the running time or introduce some crucial aspect to the story in a ridiculous manner. This one's set during medieval times, as we see a lot of people running around in ratty clothes, bad hair, and even worse teeth...oh, and look, there's a little person (is that the correct term nowadays? I'd say dwarf, but I need no blowback from the various midget/dwarf support organizations out there). Everyone knows a dream sequence just isn't a dream sequence without a little person, clad in strange garb, running around and cackling like a little a-hole...if you feel this way you should see the film Living in Oblivion (1995), but I digress...one of the reason's Argento's piece comes across as well as it does is because his eye towards hideous detail, his focus on vivid imagery, and his willingness to draw the audience's attention towards nasty, unpleasant things we might normally steer away from...overall the performances are solid, but I had a hard time swallowing Keitel's stereotypical beret wearing, pretentious, jazz listening, booze swilling, bohemian artist type character. The funniest bits for me were after the fact, as he tries to explain the subsequent absence of his girlfriend to the neighbors and her friends (apparently she was well-liked). Keitel's character was about the worst liar I've ever seen. The story flowed along nicely, and ended with a few, gruesome and welcomed twists.

The picture quality, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic, on this Blue Underground DVD release, is very sharp, and the audio excellent. There are a few different audio tracks to choose from, including Dolby Digital Surround EX, 6.1 DTS - ES, and Dolby Digital Surround 2.0. As far as extras, it depends which version you purchase (there are two). If you buy the single disc version you'll get a theatrical trailer, a poster and still gallery, and biographies for the directors. If you get the double disc version, you'll get what I've already mentioned plus four featurettes. The first is titled `Two Masters' Eyes', and it's basically series of interviews strung together, lasting about a half hour, followed by a bit about Savini's effects (12 mins), At Home with Tom Savini (16 mins), and lastly Adrienne Barbeau talking about George Romero (5 mins). There's some interesting stuff in the two disc version, but not interesting enough for me to recommend to someone to pony up the extra cost over the single disc version...at the end of the day both versions feature the exact, same film.

92,5.0,"As is becoming more common, Amazon drops the ball. The film's streaming is NOT widescreen but a pan and scan. So miss half the movie. And I freaking paid to rent it. Getting tired of being treated like crap as a customer. No rentals for the future for quite a while. Further, I rarely rent from Amazon since they raised their prices to 3.99 and 4.99 and even more for 50 year old films. Great way to price yourself out of a market. Amazon's fault as well as the films owners/distributors who won't negotiate reasonable and marketable viewing/access fees."
93,4.0,"Steve Martin hit his stride with this '90s remake.  Of course I completely understand the melt down and the freaking out about the money. $250/ a head in '91-was a lot of money.  Then I was freakng out because the little boy that played his son looks like the exact replica of the little boy in Signs--but how could that be those films were more than a decade apart.  Did a quick search and found that the two actors are brothers.  But they could pass for twins when they were younger.  Anyway, back to the movie.  This a good film about a father learning to let go of his little girl and his checkbook."
94,4.0,"I advise you, if you're the readin' type, to go unearth H.F. Saint's novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-an-Invisible-Man/dp/0689117353/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of an Invisible Man</a>, the source material for this movie. It's a better read than this movie is a better watch. Having said that, John Carpenter's adaptation is a pretty dang watchable thriller with a neat sci-fi hook. Carpenter directs it, and that alone is a tremendous selling point. It's got Daryl Hannah in the height of her babeness. Not only is she gorgeous but she plays a strong character that's fleshed out more than the typical love interest. Was Chevy Chase the best actor for this role? No. But if you'd ever wondered whether Chevy can pull off a dramatic role, well, this is as close as he gets.

It's a modern interpretation of H.G. Wells' classic horror tale. This one hews closer to Chevy's tendencies. As such, he plays Nick Halloway, an indifferent San Francisco stock analyst who's a bit of a wiseacre and whose bad timing places him in a research facility in Santa Mira, there to attend a lecture. Courtesy of a magnificent hang-over and seeking some shut-eye, he sneaks away to some out-of-the-way corner. But there's the calamitous coffee spill in the control room triggering a ""random, freakish event"" that renders bits of the building invisible. And Nick wholly invisible. Strange things tend to happen in Santa Mira. Look it up.

This retelling is more chase thriller than horror, and I think it suffers some from it in how it resonates with you. The film could've done with more of the poignancy and sense of tragedy that would've been more palpable were it on a horror platform. Oh, sure, the story explores Nick's sense of isolation and the psychological trauma of being invisible, of the absolute absence of acknowledgment from everyone, of being seen. I imagine, after some time, one begins to question one's own reality. See, there should've been more of that in the movie.

The special effects - optical married with digital - are wicked good for its time (1992). I enjoyed the, er, sight gags. We're made privy to some marvelous visuals - the cigarette smoke filling up Nick's lungs or that somewhat icky shot of Nick's food being digested. One thing that may have messed the movie up some is that, in certain scenes, we, the movie audience, can see Nick even though, to the people in the movie, he remains invisible. Maybe it was in Chase's contract that his mug must be onscreen for a certain percentage of the time. But in the 1933 version, Claude Rains kept unseen for most of the movie, and that was eerie and truly effective and drove in the thematic point.

I like this movie, stumbles and all. The Hitchcock element introduces itself pretty much right away, mostly because Nick couldn't keep his head down and his trap shut, and, so, cue the flabbergasted witnesses. But, now, here's the rogue CIA operative (Sam Neill) come sniffing around. Neill is a sinister, relentless presence, his every move, his every word shouting to the world how shady he is. Throughout, he and Chase engage in a series of tense cat-and-mouse face-offs with Chase's character each time evading capture only by the skin of his teeth. Chevy, while no Harrison Ford from The Fugitive, makes a surprisingly credible action hero.

I know this movie isn't held in high esteem by plenty of people. Reportedly, Carpenter loathed this movie. And it's certainly nowhere near Carpenter's best pictures. But Memoirs... is probably my third-favorite Chevy Chase movie, after Foul Play and Oh Heavenly Dog. Yes, over Vacation and Fletch and Spies Like Us - don't get mad. Maybe it's because of the quirk in seeing a more restrained Chevy. I think he's quite good, although, being Chevy, he couldn't resist throwing in the occasional deadpan one-liner, never mind that he's supposed to be freaking out, what with being in an alarming state of molecular flux and all. And call me a sucka but the thing that tied it all together for me was the love story. It got me invested right away, and, yes, it was poignant... and mature. Chevy is muy sympatico with his leading lady. As mentioned above, Daryl Hannah is able to, for the most part, sidestep the damsel-in-distress pitfalls. Alice Monroe (Hannah), who produces documentaries for the Smithsonian, has considerable personality. She knows her own mind. And, in banter with Nick, she gives as good as she gets.

- Alice: ""Boy, how am I gonna tell my mom about this?""
- Nick: ""All the dirty parts I'd leave out. Just tell her you met a guy, like him a lot, could be serious, he's transparent.""
- Alice: ""Are you Catholic?""
- Nick: ""No.""
- Alice: ""That could be a problem.""

Ha."
95,1.0,"I'm not sure where to begin with this weird movie. I was just curious to see how weird it really was,and dang I found out that it's pretty freaking weird. The story is about how Satan sends his demon to earth,to try and turn all the children against Santa Claus. The film has very bad acting,with unknown actors and actresses. You can tell they dubbed the dialouge in English,so it was probally made in another country. Mexico,I think. It's just a bad Christmas film,and it would be very disturbing to kids. It's just very strange. Although there are some funny moments. Especially when Satan tells the demon that he'll be punished by being forced to eat ice cream if he fails in his mission lol But overall,the movie is really bad....unless you wanna have a good laugh or two. If you want a REALLY good laugh,pick up SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS instead,and leave this one alone."
96,4.0,"This is a pretty solid movie from the late 50's produced by the king of monster-making, Toho Co.
In fact, this movie would've been perfect, but the monster scenes seemed to be lacking the kind of charisma that Godzilla brought to the screen.  As for the human scenes, they're perfect.  By perfect, I mean they're entertaining in a very campy way.  In fact, it was actually the human scenes that carried this movie through with its camp-soaked dialogue.  I'll provide some examples:
Ex. 1) Towards the beginning of the movie, members of the mining team have sent out a search party to the deepest tunnel they had.  As they're walking through, one of the men begins to talk:
""Smells down here.  Kind of sour and warm.  I don't like it!!!""
Ex. 2) After one of the bodies had been found floating in the water, the narrator chimes in with this eulogy:
""Yoshi was dead when they carried him from the mine.  But he didn't die from drowning...he had been killed.  More than killed - he had been slaughtered like an animal!!!""
Ex. 3) At the conclusion of the movie when the two Rodan get covered in lava, and burn to death, the narrator begins talking again:
""I wonder if I, a 20th Century man, could ever hope to die as well.""
LOL
In any case, there are also some funny situations:
Situation 1) Some military men spot a giant caterpillar on a nearby hill, and immediately open fire on it with their pistols.  The caterpillar then kills two soldiers and tosses them down the hill where an entourage of people are standing around.  A doctor, who had seen everything, shoves everyone out of the way, kneels down to both soldiers, examines their wounds and proclaims to everybody that ""all the wounds were done by that monster!""  (nah!!!  I'm sure they had no clue!)
Situation 2) A search party is investigating one of the underground mining tunnels.  As they're wading through the water, one of the men starts crying for help as he gets pulled down under the water.  A man standing nearby immediately fires his pistol into the water where the first guy was previously standing.  (I guess gun safety wasn't fashionable in the 50's)
In any case, the human scenes were very entertaining.  I never once got bored by any of it.
As for the monster scenes, they were solid.  But that's it.  It was missing something special.  I think a monster vs. monster scene was needed, but that's just my opinion.  I guess I just never got pulled into Rodan's charm whereas Godzilla is freaking awesome (overall).  Don't get me wrong, though...Rodan is pretty tough.  He flies at supersonic speed.  And the wind generated by such speed causes cars to fly through the air, and trees to get ripped out of their foundations.  But still, he was missing that something special.
Overall, it's a solid monster movie.  And for $5.99, you'd be silly not to check this out."
97,4.0,"Seems like people either love or hate this particular entry into the Hammer Dracula line of films.  I, myself, enjoyed it very much, and would recommend it to anyone interested in the vampire genre.
Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1969) has Christopher Lee reprising his role as the ultimate blood-sucking creature of the night, which is kind of strange as in the last film, Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966), he was destroyed...or so we thought.  The film takes place a year after the last film, as Monsignor Ernest Muller (Rupert Davies) visits the small village near Dracula's no empty castle to see how things are getting along.  Well, things aren't getting along too well as the Monsignor finds the church empty and in a rather poor state of housekeeping.  Finding the priest at the local bar, he learns that the villagers believe that while Dracula may be dead, his castle projects an aura of evil, casting a malignant shadow of evil on the town.  The Monsignor decides the only course of action is to trek up to the castle, say a prayer of exorcism, and place a fairly large cross at the doorway, expelling the curse forever.  Taking the priest with him, the two begin a long and arduous journey up the mountain, but, as they near the castle, the priest balks from fear, and the Monsignor continues on alone.  He reaches the castle, says the prayer, and places the cross (the result of both actions cause a rather freakish lighting storm...good thing he rid himself of that big, metal cross).  Meanwhile, the priest, who remained behind, starts freaking out, and begins to stumble down the mountain, trips, cracks his head open, and lands on and cracks a pool of ice, one which contains the body of Dracula, and begins to bleed onto the ice, to which the blood revives the dark, yet frozen, one.  Upon waking, Dracula takes the weak-willed priest into his service, and returns to his castle only to find his entry spoiled by the cross affixed to the doors.  This angers him, as his house has been defiled, and being a creature of evil, seeks revenge on whoever did this.  Good thing he's got the priest to fill him in on the details...
The Monsignor leaves the village to return to his home, which he shares with his sister and her daughter, Maria (Veronica Carlson), soon followed by Dracula and his new little buddy.  We also get to meet Maria's boyfriend, Paul (Barry Andrews), who works in a local bakery/bar/hotel (interesting combination, to be sure), but is only doing so until he can complete his education, and move on to bigger and better things.  Anyhow, Dracula moves into the sub-basement (the sewers) below the bakery/bar/hotel, setting up his coffin and such, and begins with his plans to exact vengeance on the Monsignor and his house.  He learns of the Monsignor's niece, and sees a perfect opportunity to carry out his goal...does he exact his revenge?  Can anyone stop this monster once and for all?
Directed by Freddie Francis, who won academy awards for cinematography for his work on Sons and Lovers (1960) and Glory (1989), Dracula Has Risen from the Grave is certainly stylish, oozing with atmosphere and providing a good deal of suspense.  Christopher Lee provides an excellent performance, despite his overall lack of dialogue.  The settings are very suitable for this kind of film, enhancing the performances, and certainly add to the overall presence of oppressive evil throughout.  Not really embraced by the critics when it first came out, with claims that the gore was a bit much, now it seems rather understated to the 21st century viewer.  The film does proceed slowly, but the pacing seems methodical, all building up to the thrilling climax.
Warner Brothers provides a crisp, clean looking wide screen print here, but very little along the lines of special features, including only a theatrical trailer for the film.  I am appreciative that this film finally made it to DVD, as Warner Brothers, in general, is pretty stingy about releasing their catalog of films to this format, and even stingier when it comes to enhancing their releases with special features, falling back mainly on recycling ones released for the laserdisc format.  If you are interesting in seeing the other films in this series, look for Dracula, Prince of Darkness (1966), Taste the Blood of Dracula (1969), Scars of Dracula (1970), Dracula AD 1972 (1972), and The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973).

98,5.0,"The only reasons I posted 5 stars for this movie is 1) I love Stephen King and if it wasn't for the 2nd stipulation I would have probably only given it 3 stars (which stinks because I love Stephen King and I HATE it when they ruin one of his books) and 2nd - it scared my kids so bad that they won't watch it to this day and they're 32 and 30 years old! (they were 8 and 10, if that, at the time :) )  I TOLD them not to mess with my movies - bad thing to say although if I'da said go ahead and watch them if you want, they'da still watched 'em anyway so it didn't matter.  But the fact that my 32 and 30yo sons can't put on their big boy pants and watch the movie without it freaking them out makes it worth the 5 stars for me!  I love it!  That'll teach 'em not to listen to their mom when she says leave it alone.  Dad doesn't like these types of movies so it doesn't matter to him.

So if my little story doesn't help you decide to watch the video, that's fine.  But I still give it the 5 stars even though I feel it's only worth 3 for the actual watchability of it.  I'd suggest watching it but don't expect a movie of the quality of ""The Shining"" or ""The Stand"" or even ""Langoliers"" (which, if you haven't watched it WATCH it - that's one I legitimately give it 5 stars with no reservation!"
99,2.0,"In 1984 Stephen King gave the world a reason to fear the children of Nebraska by writing Children of the Corn. Usually kids run around causing minor mischief pissing off a few parents here or there. However these kiddies are a bit different. Instead of the normal path, they form a murderous cult taking out every adult in sight. This is a concept that no doubt would reduce Santa to jif causing him to then swing his FTL's around over his head in a clear plastic bag. Since it has a good cult following the Sci-fi channel thought it must be a good idea to do a remake. Usually the remake idea never follows through well as was the case with Children of the Corn.

In this version we have a couple, with their marriage on the rocks, taking a little road trip. As they cruise through the cornfields of Nebraska they plow down a kid who runs across the road. Obviously not helping the marriage counseling process. Now they're freaking out and notice the kid's throat was slit and decided to get all Tommy Boy on him by throwing him in their trunk. As they come to the next town they soon find a pack of little punk kids of supernatural sorts and are forced into battle. After about a half hour into the film it really starts to go downhill. The main characters acting gets way to corny as he challenges the kids using his military experience. It's quite hilarious to watch this guy get chased down by some kids as young as 7, not all being male.

So in conclusion, the remake had nowhere near the effect the original had. There were some legit moments of enjoyment and even a couple laughs along the way. Unfortunately there wasn't enough to keep you interested. Even from a strictly B standpoint it couldn't work. Now we don't want to be too critical so have to  give some credit being that it was a sci-fi channel picture that was a cut above most. Compared to their usual disasters like Grizzly Rage or Mega Snake this one ranks high on their list. As far as a recommendation we can only say feel free to check it out when it's on t.v, but please don't spend $20 some odd dollars. Do like Santa would do and save it for a lap dance."
100,5.0,"Can I just be honest here and say that I'm not a huge fan of Pasolini's films. I have seen Accatone, the gospel according to matthew which was pretty good, and mamma roma which wasn't bad either. For some reason I could never truly appreciate his films until I saw Salo and realized that he was brilliant. But that was like once in a blue moon. Now by chance I saw Teorema and was instantly impressed. It's definitely freaking awesome and what's most interesting is that most of the acting is based on body language. It's very effective!

The storyline you may think as out of date but i feel it stands the test of time. How many moments have we had where there's one certain experience that forever changes our lives for better or for worse. In this case, it's one person who deeply affects the ""rich"" family.

It's well worth your time to catch this."
101,5.0,"My mother brought this movie home for ""Movie Night"" back when I was 12 year old.  We laughed at her and tied making fun of Windwalker, but at the end of the night, I was a good freaking movie.  Now that I am approaching 40 years old, I bought this movie and watched it with my kids.  It is definately not a big budget, sweeping ""epic"" along the lines of Dancing With Wolves, but it is a small budget/studio success story.  If you like Native American films, you will like this."
102,4.0,"While I thought Hexed (1993) was an entertaining feature, there was a slight bit of disappointment for me in that with a title like that for a film, I half expected there to be some supernatural elements involved within the story, but there wasn't...I will say this, though, whatever disappointment I may have had over the title in relation to the film vanished once Claudia `Ivanova' Christian (The Hidden, Maniac Cop 2, ""Babylon 5"") made the scene...homina homina...written and directed by Alan Spencer (""Sledge Hammer!""), the film stars, along with Ms. Christian, Arye Gross (Soul Man, House II: The Second Story).  Also appearing is Adrienne Shelly (I'll Take You There), R. Lee Ermey (Full Metal Jacket, Fletch Lives), Ray Baker (Silverado, Total Recall), Michael E. Knight (""All My Children""), and the late Norman Fell (Airport 1975, The End), probably best known as his role of the skeevy landlord Mr. Roper on the television sitcom ""Three's Company"".

Arye Gross plays the character Matthew Welsh, a hotel clerk who desires more from life than that which is his current lot, so much so he makes up all kinds of outrageous lies about his life, perhaps in the hopes some of them will come true (as the movie begins we see him arriving at the hotel on New Year's Eve dressed in a tuxedo, acting all snooty and mingling with the guest during a party before getting busted).  When the news of a special guest, a European super model named Hexina (Christian), gets around, Matthew immediately starts telling his co-workers about a bogus past relationship he had with the woman, to which no one believes him because everyone knows he's a rotten, stinking, filthy liar.  Anyway, certain circumstances present themselves in such a way that allows Matthew to impersonate an individual Hexina has come to town to visit, but has never met, leading up to a wild night of the boudoir boogie, capped off by Hexina trying to pierce Matthew's skull with a large carving knife.  Turns out the guy Matthew's impersonating is a blackmailer, one who's got compromising information about Hexina's past (she ends up being as big a phony as Matthew, but a hell of a lot more attractive), and she was only trying to throw a scare into him, or so she says...Matthew spills the beans about his real identity and then helps Hexina track down the guy he was impersonating, who Hexina ends up killing because it turns out that, along with being one of the world's hottest supermodels, she's also a homicidal lunatic, and will do anything to protect her secrets.  From here things go from bad to worse for Matthew as the bodies begin to pile up and the police, including Detective Ferguson (Ermey), see Matthew as the prime suspect, (it doesn't help that Hexina keeps planting evidence supporting this notion).

If you're familiar with the type of comedy featured in Alan Spencer's late 1980s television series Sledge Hammer!, starring David Rasche, then you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect here, the main difference being here things are slightly more raunchy as there's a decent amount of profanity along with some nudity, two elements that obviously wouldn't fly on network television.  If you're not familiar with the television series then imagine the humor from the Naked Gun television series and films, only a little darker.  The jokes here range from sort of lame to pretty funny, but the main problem, at least as I see it, is there's about as many present as there was in a half hour episode of Sledge, stretched out here to fill an hour an half film (I won't even get into trying to compare the comedic ability of Arye Gross to David Rasche).  The funniest bit for me was when Matthew, in an effort to perpetuate his story about having had a relationship with Hexina, takes headshots of himself and pastes them onto pictures with Hexina, eventually trying to pass one off on his co-workers as the real deal...suffice to say they look ridiculously fake, capable of fooling perhaps a mentally challenged three year old child.  There's not much of a story here as what's present seems here more just to prop up the gags than anything else.  I've never a big fan of Arye Gross and his receding hairline, so I had a hard time getting behind his character specifically because he was sniveling, little liar who scammed his way into Christian's character's pants and spends the rest of the time freaking out in lame fashion...maybe there's some jealously on my part seeing as how he got to appear with her sans her clothes, but beyond that I never felt like he was leading man material.  He comes off more as a supporting character, and an odious one at that.  As far as Ms. Christian, she seemed the dominant character in the film, and generally a lot more fun to watch (I hardly noticed Arye Gross when the two appeared together in a scene).  She does appear nekkid a couple of times, but there's no full on frontal, only a full on behind shot and some quick side shots.  This, along with the profanity, is what garnered the `R' rating.  R. Lee Ermey makes a good showing as a police detective, along with showing he can do humor, and Michael E. Knight appears as Matthew's condescending, slimy, a-hole superior Simon, a role which I really enjoyed as the guy was such a skeevy weasel I couldn't help laugh when he was on screen, terrorizing Gross' character.  Given his penchant for antagonizing the main protagonist in the film, you know something suitably bad will happen to him (and it does), so enjoy his screen time while you can (the scene where he's checking out Matthew's apartment really made me laugh).  One thing that sort of puzzles me is why Alan Spencer didn't just make a Sledge Hammer! feature film instead of this, as I think it would have been much better received, but whatever...all in all this movie is probably best left to Sledge fans, guys who've got a thing for Claudia Christian (I happen to be both), and/or people who can appreciate dark, silly humor in general.

The picture, presented in widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1), comes across clean and clear, and the Dolby Surround audio sounds decent.  The are some special features available including English, Japanese, and Spanish subtitles, three deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a director's commentary track for the film, a four minute promotional featurette for the film, and a theatrical trailer.  Also included are previews for other DVD releases like Little Black Book (2004), 50 First Dates (2004), The Sweetest Thing (2002), D.E.B.S. (2004), and Stripes (1981).

103,2.0,"OK, I loved the first movie. The Highlander (1986) is probably in my top 25 favorite movies of all time. Somehow the producers for Highlander 2 convinced Connery to reprise his role as Ramirez (probably the $3 million for 6 days works did the trick!).  Re-uniting Christopher Lambert and Connery had POTENTIAL.  Unfortunately, this potential was destroyed by a horrible script, ridiculous story, horrible new characters and poor acting. In short, they screwed this up BIG TIME.  In this edition of the DVD, many of the special effects have been digitally changed and remastered.  Although this pretty cool, it's still just putting lipstick on a pig.

What I hated:
* Really stupid is the plot line where Katana (Ironside) suddenly wants MacLeod dead after he's spent 500+ years in ""exile"" on earth. At this point in the film, MacLeod is in his 80's and at death's door anyway.  How do you expect us to believe this load of garbage?  I guess the creator's thought that if the audience were stupid enough to believe the Ramirez can come back from the dead after getting his head chopped off in the first Highlander, than the audience will believe ANYTHING.
* The movie had the look and feel of a bad comic book from the 1930's yet the year was 2024.  What the hell is that all about?
* Why did they have to show us backstory of the immortals (who they are , where they came from etc).  It ruined the mystique of the original movie!  Dumb decision on creator's part.

* Michael Ironside's character aka General Katana - Mulcahy circa 1990: ""Hey Michael, this is what I want you to do to prepare for the role of the bad guy in this film.  go watch the original Highlander and pay close attention to Clancy Brown as the Kurgan.  We want you to copy that performace. Yeah, be like the new Kurgan or someting. Yeah, that's the ticket.""  Ummm, didn't work fellas.  I freaking hated Michael Ironside in this movie. Bad, bad, bad.

* Virgina Madsen, as Louise Marcus, was the one who really killed this movie.  Her character was laughable at best and her acting was an embarrasement.  I was hoping that she bought the farm early in the movie.  Unfortunatley, we have to suffer from her performance to the very end.

* Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb aka the two idiots from the Planet Zeist that come to kill MacLeod.  They were hilariously bad but even worse, once MacLeod chops off their heads (and this becomes immortal again - wha wha what?) he his a little boom boom with Lousie Marcus, whom he met like 5 minutes earlier.  To the Director:  please delete this scene when you do the Super Special Director's Cut.

Final Thoughts:  I picked this DVD up in the bargain rack at Walmart for 5 bucks.  It was worth it to me becuase I laughed out loud numerous times when I viewed it.  Plus, there are tons of special features which were actually interesting.  In parting, it is true, there can be only ONE, and this is NOT the one. BUT, if you can pick it up for 5 bucks and you want a good laugh, Go for it!"
104,5.0,"This movie was seriously freaking awesome! I have always loved the X-Men movies and I knew that at the end of wolverine in Japan when he ran into magneto and Prof. X in the airport that they were going to put on a great movie for us. This movie had it all!!!!!!!
The young Prof. X puts on a heck of an emotional performance. It was beautiful seeing a lot of the old cast. I still am angry at Anna Paquin's character for getting that shot that takes away her mutant abilities early on in the series, because she would've been great in this movie meeting up with her old boyfriend and frenemy.
I love Wolverines character. And I love the young Eric/magneto. Even Mystique I absolutely adore learning what made her tick!
There's so many great scenes in this movie and so many great messages. I've always wished that I had a mutant ability. Mutant  and proud!
I wonder what they are going to come up with next. Because it's obvious Prof. X and magneto are getting up there in age and they do not have Logan's ability of not aging. There was one sad part where the character of Mistique found out what happened to her old gang  the red Devil guy, The fairy girl that could spit fire balls, the ice crystal girl, etc.
I truly love everything about this movie and series. That is why I have a gush fest going on here."
105,5.0,"Even though the original ""V-The Miniseries"" aired over 20 years ago, I still find myself watching it over and over again. Yes, I recorded it from broadcast TV years ago, and wore out those tapes, and, yes, I then purchased both ""V-The Miniseries"" and ""V-The Final Battle"" when I found them on VHS. I have since bought both of them in DVD format, and will definetely buy the whole series when it comes out this month on DVD.

 Many people were not aware that ""V-The Miniseries"" actually had a ""conclusion"" miniseries air a year later. While the original was awesome (with then-unheard-of special/make-up effects that totally outshone other shows/series of its time), I was very disappointed when it ended the way it did... Which is why I was thrilled when ""The Final Battle"" was later aired on TV. I also enjoyed the series that followed. However, although the series never captivated me as much as the previous miniseries did, I still will definetely add it to my DVD collection.

 Even many people who were not sci-fi fans enjoyed these miniseries, as there are some definite parallels between the aliens coming to Earth (and trying to defeat the humans in the manner they did) and the Holocaust (and the propoganda ""war"" and virtual enslavement of the Jewish community that the Nazi regime created). Although I do remember some people freaking out over the idea that something like that could happen in the ""present day"" (of course that's the early-80's).

 Overall, I highly recommend watching the entire thing (both ""V-The Miniseries"", and ""V-The Final Battle"") together, or else you miss so much. I have to admit that some of the acting lagged (although I really did like Michael Ironside's character), but the plot and the overall quality of the movie more than made up for it. Some people have complained that the DVD release is a ""fake widescreen"", in that they cut off the top and bottom of the film to make it that way, but if so, I didn't really notice it. If you've never seen it before, you'll really enjoy it. If you've seen it several times, you'll really enjoy seeing it brought back to life in its new format!!!"
106,5.0,"I don't know why I decided to get this movie. To say that I rented it on a whim would even be understatement. In fact, this movie was prehaps my most random find ever, and what a find it was.

Mei, age 4, and Satsuki, age 8, are two (very) energetic girls. They just moved out to the country to live in a rickity old house, without a telephone, under a camphor tree. Some people said that the house was haunted, but really, a lot of black soot just hang around there (very similar to the soot in Spirited Away). The girls' mother is in a hospital (presumably with spinal tuberculosis) and their loving father, a professor (I presume), lives with them.

Mei meets a troll. Now, this ain't your big ugly Lord of the Rings troll or the mean, sly under-the-bridge troll: this is Totoro- the single coolest creature to ever be painted onto the silver screen. He is adorable, yes freaking adorable, but tough looking, and his tail, oh man, what a tail. It is difficult to transcribe into words how much I love Totoro and want him to be my neigbor.

The animation is amazing. Nothing short of it. Just like in Spirited Away, some of the paintings look like very beautiful nature photographs. Totoro looks awesome. The girls' emotions are captured perfectly with the pen and easel.

Now, typically, I hate kids in movies. They whine complain and say stupid things or act more mature than the adults. These children do neither. They act like real kids. They have real emotions and real problems. They have vibrant imaginations, but realistic problems. In other words, no movie I have ever seen before, better portrayed children.

Get this movie."
107,5.0,"This is one of the funniest movies out on the market today.  Let me start by that.  Oh, yeah, before this review begins:  WHY ISN'T THIS ON DVD YET!!!!!?  WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!!!?
Now, back to the review.  This is a movie that is GUARANTEEDto make you laugh until it hurts and you are on the ground, laughing so hard that your crying.  This is also a very underated movie that should've gotten a lot more recognition.
It's about a Christmas gone straight to hell.  Denis Leary plays a theif who is fleeing from the cops when a robbery has gone wrong.  He takes a couple hostage, hoping to hide out in their home and stay away from the police.  Well, he's about to find out that he's going to wish the cops had caught him, because the couple he has taken hostage are bitter, angry, and always yelling at each other.  Gun or no gun, this couple will fight and argue until Hell freezes over.  Leary does his best to try to calm things down, but he just might lose his sanity before the night is over.
Denis Leary steals the show, spewing some of the funniest lines ever heard.  He is presented as the foul-mouthed, anger-filled comedian we all know and love.  Kevin Spacey is also very funny in this movie, and this was before he was famous.  The script is very original.  This is a holiday classic that should be on everyone's list.
What are you waiting for?  A freaking invitation?  Go and see this movie already!  You won't regret it.  This has to be one of the funniest films I have ever seen.  An orignal work of art, if you ask me.  I can't wait for this to come out on DVD, but for now, I guess the VHS will just have to do.  ""The Ref"" is a hillarious, uproaring, tongue-lashing, anger spewing, one-way ticket to hell...and you're going to want to go a second time!"
108,4.0,"The definition of ""strange"" is ""something which is different from what is usual, normal or expected."" The definition of ""macabre"" is ""involving death or violence in a way that is strange, frightening, or unpleasant; having death as a subject : comprising or including a personalized representation of death.""

Both these words apply to THE WICKER MAN.

I'd heard rumors and whispers about this movie for years; I'd even read Christopher Lee's warm words for it in his autobiography, but I didn't watch it until this year, and I admit that about halfway through I was ready to press STOP and give up. The movie was slow, eccentric, bizarre and at times, borderline ridiculous; then, all of the sudden, the eccentricity began to ravel into a feeling of increasing unease and menace, a sort of ""everyone is in on the joke except the hero, and it's a very black joke indeed."" By the climax I was watching mainly to see what the hell would happen, and once it did...well, not since the original PLANET OF THE APES have I been so jarred by a movie's ending.

THE WICKER MAN is the story of a British policeman named Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) who flies out to the remote, clannish, half-forgotten Scottish island of Summerisle, to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison. Almost immediately upon landing he begins to suspect the tight-lipped islanders aren't telling him everything, but his frustrated investigation rapidly yields one piece of very disconcerting information: on Summerisle, Christianity is dead and Celtic Paganism is the one true faith. Howie, a devout and somewhat self-righteous Christian, is revolted by this, and by the wanton sexuality of the island's female population, most noticeably the gorgeous Willow MacGregor (Brit Ecklund). Encountering the island's de facto ruler, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), Howie gradually begins to suspect that Rowan Morrison may not have been murdered as he first suspected, but may in fact have been kidnapped preparatory to some Celtic ritual of human sacrifice. Determined to save Rowan's life, he searches the island from one end to the other without success, before deciding on an even more radical plan of action: he will infiltrate the ""cult"" by masquerading as one of them. Only then will he discover the answer to the question that brought him to Summerisle and has now placed his life in jeopardy: what the devil happened to Rowan Morrison?

As I said, I found the first half of this movie to be heavy going. There is a lot of bizarre dialogue and a lot -- I mean a LOT -- of singing. A lot of what I saw seemed weird for the sake of being weird and I didn't understand what the hell the point of all of this discomfort was. Only my loyalty to Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee kept me going, but once I crested Mount Weird, I began to see that like Rowan Morrison, I was being led somewhere...somewhere very freaking nasty, and all the nastier because the bad guys in this film don't see themselves as bad at all. Quite the contrary....

Obviously I am not giving you hard details here, because I can't describe the movie very accurately without giving away the store. What I can say is that Edward Woodward delivers a possibly career-best performance as a devoutly Christian cop whose entire sense of right and wrong, sane and insane, and hell, even up and down, are attacked from the moment he lands his seaplane by the quiet little island -- at first subtly, then more and more blatantly until the audience wonders just how much power the law has on an island which seems to be a law unto itself. This is a film that crumbles the self-assurance of its hero by degrees, inflicting a slow nonviolent torture on both him and the viewer, until exploding into a climax so jarring, so disturbing, and so outright horrifying that it took me hours to recover.

And isn't that exactly what you want from a horror movie?"
109,4.0,"What in the world am I watching? that's what I kept thinking to myself through this film. I've heard about the wicker man a few times in the past, but never saw it. Now that I'm diving into more 70's and 80's forgotten stuff, I wanted to check this one out.  Nobody told me this was a freaking musical! Folk music at every turn, songs about men springing their trees and weird stuff like that! Now I'm not saying I didn't find it entertaining,I did. but WOA this thing is a whole different kind of ballgame. This is NOT a horror movie at all. Yeah Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt are in it, but don't buy this thinking it's Hammer . Just keep an open mind...Way open...and it helps if like John Denver music."
110,1.0,"I love del Toro's movies, but this was a major disappointment. Apart from a few nice visuals, this film has no redeeming quality. Every scene is predictable, badly acted, badly filmed, and not even remotely scary.

Furthermore, this movie features possibly the worst child actor in history of the world cinema. I'd imagine that a young girl (5? 6?) who's just seen her grandpa come back from the dead looking like a corpse would be freaking out, or show at least SOME sort of emotion. This child's face and body language were only a tad more alive than a plastic manequin, including the scene where she splits a man's skull open with a walking stick. For me, that drove the final nail into the coffin of this movie.

Skip this one, and see The Devil's Backbone instead."
111,3.0,"As I write this review, there are at least ten, separate DVD releases for the film, The Invisible Ghost (1941), some double features, some stand alone releases, which is usually a good indicator that the movie has fallen into the public domain, meaning the original copyright for the film has since lapsed, and now anyone can broadcast or release the film, if they have the means.  The most famous case of this is Frank Capra's It's A Wonderful Life (1946).  Ever wonder why it's shown on every stinking channel all hours of the day and night during the holidays?  Well, it is a classic, but also none of the TV stations that broadcast it have to pay a penny to anyone for showing it...but I digress...written by Al and Helen Martin and directed by Joseph H. Lewis (Pride of the Bowery, The Mad Doctor of Market Street), The Invisible Ghost stars Bela Lugosi (Dracula, White Zombie), in one of a number of poverty row films he starred in during his `exile' from the major studio system.  Also appearing is Polly Ann Young (Murder on the Yukon), John McGuire (The Prisoner of Shark Island), Clarence Muse (Huckleberry Finn, Show Boat), Terry Walker (Dangerous Lady), Betty Compson (Mr. & Mrs. Smith), Ernie Adams (Pride of the Legion), and George Pembroke (Bluebeard).

As the film begins we see Charles Kessler (Lugosi) sitting down to dinner alone...or is he?  He's seems to be having a conversation with the empty chair across from him (he even tells the butler to serve the empty chair first)...nutty, perhaps, but then we learn this is an annual event, marking Kessler's wedding anniversary, only Mrs. Kessler (Compson) is unable to attend due to the fact she ran off with another man some years ago, leaving behind Charles and their daughter Virginia (Young), and died in a subsequent car accident, or so is the common belief.  Well, turns out she ain't dead, but secretly stowed away in the cellar of the gardener's shack...why?  I had a hard time understanding (and I saw the film!), but it has something to do with her having amnesia.  Since her leaving there's been a rash of unexplained murders, which only happen at night, of the household staff (strangulations), but little in the way of clues as to the murderer.  Virginia's boyfriend Ralph (McGuire) makes the scene, just about the time the current maid gets it, who he apparently had a past history with, and now he's on the hot seat, fingered by the inept authorities for her death.  His brother Paul (also played by McGuire) shows up, and another person dies (the gardener), proving that, while good help may be hard to find, it's even harder to keep...from getting killed!  Things eventually come to a head during a dark and stormy night as those left try to get to the bottom of things...

There really isn't much of a mystery here although it seems like the film was touted as such within the promotional material, as we know who the killer is fairly early into the film, along with the motive.  Another thing the film does not have, despite the title, is an actual ghost, which was disappointing as I do like a good ghost story, but whatever...given how much we know early on, there seems to be little in terms of the story to keep the audience interested, but the movie does have a few things going for it, like creepy atmosphere and Lugosi himself.  There's a scene in the film where Lugosi's character's in the maid's room, and the camera is positioned in such a way that it looks like he's coming at the audience.  He has a smile on his face, but it's not of the `Let's be friends' type...no, it's more of the sinister `I going to throttle the life out of you' type.  This, to me, was the highlight as few could pull off this kind of thing as well as he did.  Another interesting aspect with regards to the film was that of Clarence Muse's character of the African American butler Evans.  I was half expecting some sort of goofy, buffoonish, caricature prevalent in films about the time, but that wasn't the case here.  His character was actually a capable one, lacking any speech impediments, one that seemed to garner a certain amount of respect despite his position within the household.  Actually, Muse was quite an accomplished individual, holding a law degree, and thought of as a pioneer in the black theater movement.  As far as John McGuire playing the dual roles of the brothers Ralph and Paul Dickson, there wasn't, as far as I know, any mention of them being twins, but I think this was done because it was probably cheaper to just have one actor play both roles.  The one aspect that really stuck me as odd was the fact that while there were a number of murders in the house, no one within the house seemed all that put out by the fact a murderer was running around.  I don't know about you, but someone gets murdered in my house, I'll be commencing to freaking out...the characters seemed not so bothered that household servants were being knocked off (and the murderer may be lurking about), but more so by the inconvenience of having to fill another, vacant position.  Also, the story is filled with aspects that are the way they are only because they're written in the script that way, and not because they developed naturally.  All in all the good canceled out the bad, so I was left feeling pretty neutral by the end.  Had the movie not had Lugosi, I wouldn't have even bothered...I haven't seen all of Lugosi's poverty row films, but of the ones I have seen, White Zombie (1932), Bowery at Midnight (1942), and The Devil Bat (1940) are among the better ones, in my opinion.

This Roan DVD release features a decent looking, fullscreen (1.33:1) picture, presented in its original aspect ratio.  The print does have plenty of flaws, but it is watchable.  The Dolby Digital mono audio comes through well enough.  There are a couple of extra features on the DVD, including a Cast & Credits listing, and text relating a little about the films background, which is also the same material print on the back of the DVD case.  As I said, there are at least ten different DVD releases of this film, and I couldn't speak towards the quality of these other releases, so buyer beware.

112,5.0,The movie was very entertaining and those uniforms were freaking awesome!
113,4.0,"I will admit that I did not read the book, but if your shocked that it's not as good as the book then you haven't watched many book adapations.
(not to say I haven't been [upset] about book adaptions before however)
Then you got people complaining well it's a christian movie.  Well don't look it as that way, cause even a person who Totally does not believe in the bible can find the storys in the bible to be the best storys ever written.
(I am christian though)
then you got christian's saying that this is so untrue etc.  well most christian ministers will tell you exactly as this movie told you.  BUT weather you believe it's a reality or not it don't matter just listen to the freaking STORY! people will go and watch a movie with the fakest storys possible and no one complains.  But yet when something TRIES to cling to a reality saying something is gonna happen, people cannot accept it as a story and they then wanna use that against certin people (christians)  I am fine with all religions and even thoughs that have no religion, But just focus on the story!  IT is NOT an action movie! it is not a Bruce Willis movie.
This is not the best movie in the world! AND THANK GOD no hollywood junk here.
The acting is not the best (not the worst either) BUT Sure as heck alot better then that Hollywood junk, and besides that not all great movies need good acting. I AGREE I judge acting too, but not on a movie such as this.
But I sat down as a request of a friend and for the first look at the opening and such I was waiting for the point and ahhh I wasn't into it at all.
The movie came along and then showed it's story!
and I will be honest, it's a GREAT MOVIE! The story is really good! you also have a stephen King Feeling in the air plane scene.
You have a ""good"" Feeling ending.
I think this film did very well.
although as I said this is not judging by the book.  NOW! if you wanna judge it by the book then your probaly best not seeing any movies made from a book again.
but in anycase thoughs are your opinions and this is mine.
I say watch this movie."
114,3.0,"This is a painful yet highly effective introduction to the world of incredibly bad movies.  The best tape out of these three is something that will make you say, ""Is this a movie??  It can't be.  No movie can be this bad.  This must be something else.""

But no, these are real movies.  It's just that you don't hear much about their theatrical release history, which makes sense, because they're so bad.

Let's start with oldest of these three movies, Glen or Glenda.  This is a movie that attempts to grab your attention with the first-ever sex change operation (which was a current event at that time) before it segways into a movie about transvestites.  Why a transvestite movie?  Because Ed Wood, the man responsible for the movie, was a transvestite himself.  He wanted people to understand why he was the way he was.  The movie does accomplish Wood's desire in a way, but it's so bad that going any more than halfway through the final print is darn near impossible.  The story just stops in the middle and random music and footage arise to combine in such a wrecthed manner that the audience is hypnotized to instantly press the nearest ""off"" button they can find.  So only half of what Ed Wood wanted to show actually comes across.

Fortunately, Ed's films do get better.  Bride of the Monster can actually be viewed all the way through, but just barely.  Not much happens in it.  I think it's supposed to be one of those movies that shows us how taking science too far is ultimately destructive.  Also, it seems to put a lot of emphasis on the unsurpassed danger of lying on top of a completely immobile fake octopus.

Plan 9 From Outer Space can actually be watched more than once.  That doesn't mean it's good, but it's actually not PAINFUL painful like the others.  It's just mildly painful.  It takes the destructive science theme from Bride of the Monster and brings it a step further, saying man will destroy the universe by finding a way to explode rays of light.  The ""Plan 9"" of the title is actually an attempt by outer space aliens to stop man before this explosive carnage happens.  But all that doesn't seem to grab your attention when Ed won't even bother doing a second take after a man nearly falls over trying to pick up a freaking newspaper.

I highly recommend this as a supplement to Tim Burton's 1994 biography of Ed Wood.  Why?  Because you actually get to see the REAL footage that Johnny Depp acts out in the Burton movie.  So this set of tapes is very educational, but gosh, the movies are ever so bad."
115,2.0,"The Sherlock Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett is probably the most faithful adaptation of the Great Detective's adventures... but it still has a rotten apple or two.

And the rottenest apple is the TV movie ""Sherlock Holmes - The Last Vampyre,"" an incredibly and painfully loose adaptation that is more confusing than mysterious. Brett and Edward Hardwicke seem a bit baffled by the fact that they're even in this story, especially since their characters have little effect on ANYTHING.

Holmes (Brett) and Watson (Hardwicke) are approached with an odd problem: a small village is currently being plagued by mysterious deaths and hardships. The villagers believe that the newly-arrived John Stockton (Roy Marsden) is a vampire, descended from an evil family that their ancestors slaughtered long ago.

Holmes, of course, poohpoohs the idea of vampires because... well, he's Sherlock Holmes, and he doesn't buy the undead. But he's intrigued by the case, so he and Watson head out to the country.

There they find that Stockton is staying with the wealthy Fergusons, who are falling apart -- the baby died of sudden pneumonia, and the wife and son seem to have fallen under Stockton's spell. Now Holmes must unravel the TRUE cause of these deaths, before even more people die.

""The Last Vampyre"" is sorta-kinda-maybe-based on a short story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle... and if you squint, you can see bits of it. Only bits. The actual plotline is drastically changed, unimportant characters are added (I do not care about the maid's love life!), and little seems to actually happen.

Instead, it's mostly just Holmes and Watson meandering around, asking questions and accomplishing little. It's like they wandered onto a strange Hammer Horror movie -- mysterious deaths, a crippled kid intrigued by a slutty maid, marital trouble between the Fergusons, and the superstitious commonfolk freaking out over a suspected vampire. NOTHING HAPPENS. Definitely not detective work.

Also, the vampire angle is... strange. It seems to be suggested that Stockton actually IS a vampire of some kind, and has some supernatural powers -- even though that is NEVER a part of Sherlock Holmes mysteries. When the movie ends abruptly, without Holmes explaining anything, we're left wondering what exactly just happened here.

It's a credit to Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke that they manage to make this part of the story watchable, because the characters almost feel like an afterthought in a bad gothic soap opera. They almost compensate for the mediocre acting from most of the actors, who are either over-the-top (Marsden) or sleepwalking (Richard Dempsey).

""Sherlock Holmes - The Last Vampyre"" is probably the worst entry in Jeremy Brett's venerable run -- a confusing, bloated mess where Sherlock Holmes himself feels like an afterthought."
116,5.0,"I really enjoyed this movie the first time i saw it... which happened to be this year. The only reason i saw it so late was because no one would give me a straight answer as to what it was about. Finally a co-worker who is also one of ""the best f-ing cash-man's that ever lived"" told me what it was about and coerced me to buy the movie. I freaking watched it that night, even though i had final in my social-psych class the next day. I tryed to study for a while, but the movie took me in, and reminded me so much of how work was for me. I hate customers, but what am i going to do about it. The thing Randal says about working would be great if there were no customers is soo true. Another thing this movie points out is how many things can happen in one day, its amazoning; i've never seen such a sequential movie like this before.
One thing i'm glad he left out was that alternate ending, it would have made the movie so bleak, and alot less likely for people to get into. It would have really dragged the movie down if he kept it in."
117,5.0,this is such a great freaking movie!  In my opinion this one was the 4th finest new jersey saga film.  The dialogue is witty and very sarcastic (randall is the best) and the black and white filming really puts an interesting spin on the tone of the film.  This movie follows two convenience store clerks throughout one of the worst days of one of their lives and paints caricatures of all the a**holes in society that we would love to have shot.  funny funny stuff.
118,2.0,"What I want to say is that I really, really tried to love this movie, OK? I made a real effort. LOL.

Now, I watched Episode 1 more than once, so I didn't hate it. Each time, as with viewing any film multiple times, certain things would stick out or grab me more than others. Some aspects of the story, certain special effects or visuals, the music, dialog, specific characters, etc.,whatever, would be more prevalent, more on my mind, more in focus.

Anyway. Alright, the two things that I could not accept, that just to me are virtually impossible to ignore are:

1. Jar Jar appearing in the movie __as MUCH as he does__.
2. Darth Maul appearing in the movie __as LITTLE as he does__.

Also --and maybe this is #3-- would definitely be the way Darth Maul dies. Nope, sorry do NOT, can not buy that. Look, he just stands there. Go back and watch it if you'd like -- Darth Maul stares at Obi Wan with a frown on his face, sees Obi Wan looking over to the side staring at a light saber, and then watches as the young Jedi flies up from the shaft -right in front of him- and then comes down on his(Maul's) other side. OK, watch it again if you feel this is nit picking at all. It's absurd, __especially since Darth Maul is portrayed, in the few scenes he is in, as a total bad a**!__ What was Maul doing? He literally just stands there and then after Obi Wan lands he slowly turns around and doesn't even make a move.

Back to #1 and #2: I know, I understand Jar Jar is for the children. Fine, I got it. But, man, we all could have done with a bit less of that character. Also, they coulda toned it down a couple of times -- as for example when they are at the dinner table. You know the scene.. I thought, OMG, ""he's actually ruining the movie"". But I would have been fine with Jar Jar if he had a smaller role. #2 What the *****? Remember those AWESOME PREVIEWS with Maul in them looking so freaking bad? He was barely in the movie and instead a retarded children's comic relief imbecile was the star.

Now, look, I am familiar with the tendency, ESPECIALLY for fans, or what would be better described as SUPER-FANS to rationalize away the flaws, ample flaws, of these films. I am also aware of the common tendency to be overly critical of the movies. So, I hope that I am not simply coming across as overly critical here. All I wanted to bring up is that in watching this movie a bunch of times I could let slide a lot of stuff, but not everything.

Hope you enjoyed my two cents and let's hope future Star Wars stories are better, and are told better as well. Lucas created something special, something that I think grew larger and is greater than his ability to handle. God I wish he'd let Spielberg direct."
119,5.0,man this movie brings back childhood memories love this movie freaking classic back when cgi wasn't the main thing and movies were more passion imo
120,3.0,"I don't want to piss the NS fans out there but I don't see how good this is?  I mean I have to agree with one reviewer, this is one of the coolest animes but I didn't think it was a masterpiece.
The story was alright but not big!
The animation was great but not excellent.
The action was great.
Over all it was an alright Ninja flick.  Though I think this film is a little overhyped.
Also I have a problem of people saying ""OH THERES A RAPE SCENE!  OH!
Gimmi a freaking break its not like you see what going on!  Even though you have the sence of whats going on it's still stupid how people make a big deal that you see like a 2 minute rape scene which you barley see anything but a nipple shot.  Jeez.
Now I must say the violence is over the top.  Especially when one guy gets both his arms ripped right off. EEWWWW thats gotta hurt.
Over all I thought this was an alright flick I guess.
Check it out for yourself and give your opinion on it."
121,5.0,"If you are watching this movie with the dwarf in the Red Room, you obviously love it.  It's Lynch at his best.  Surpassed only by Mulholland Drive as the most ""fun"" of his movies.  Morphing pictures.  Smeared lipstick.  Ray Wise at his most menacing. Grace Zabrinske freaking out for no reason. Mind-controlling music.  Need I say more?

For all those who are looking for the movie to make ""sense,"" then I suggest renting back episodes of Rizzoli and Isles or Monk and call it a day."
122,4.0,"Naturally, it's Twin Peaks fans that will get the most out of this film coz that's the audience this film was made for.  Sure, any fan of David Lynch will watch this movie whether they've seen the show or not, but it'll end up being confusing.  Even though it's a prequel to the series' events, it's made for those familiar with the plotlines from the show.  Characters will appear in one scene and will never be seen again, leaving those unfamiliar saying, ""who was that and what the hell did he have to do with anything?""  Not to mention Laura's killer not being a secret at all .  Even some fans were let down by this one coz many were expecting answers and probably ended up with more questions than anything.  Typical of Lynch though, eh?  The movie is definitely Lynch all the way.  It has the same slow, dreamy feeling of most of his films.  Of course it's full of oddball characters who's only purpose is to say goofy things and act weird.  But among all this strangeness, there is a story.  With an R rating, you get the feeling that this is how the series might have played out if Lynch wasn't bound by the restrictions of network television.  The first 40 minutes or so focus on the investigation of the girl murdered one year before Laura Palmer.  The investigators are played by Kiefer Sutherland and Chris isaak, who seem right at home in Lynch's FBI world next to characters like Agent Cooper, Albert Rosenfield and Gordon Cole.  Once that's done, we jump into Laura Palmer's last few days.  My problem with this is the fact that Laura comes across as extremely unlikable.  She's always screaming, snorting coke, screwing someone or freaking out somehow.  It makes it difficult to work up any sympathy for her considering you kept hearing in the series how loved she was by everyone in the town.  I do realize that it was said that in her last few days she began to act strange, and a reoccuring theme throughout the series was that she had a dark side.  I guess it does make sense that in her last few days the dark side would be at it's peak, but even with that said, she's still kinda irritating.  Also, the appearance of Agent Cooper(the star of the series, but more or less a cameo in the film) seems kinda forced, like he was required to appear coz it's a Twin Peaks movie.  His character had nothing to do with anything until Laura Palmer died, but in this film they try to work in some kind of psychic link/premonition thingee with him and Laura that doesn't seem to work so well.  Most fans won't care about this though coz they get to spend a little more time with their favorite FBI man.  Supposedly Lynch had to leave over an hour of this film on the cutting room floor.  In doing this, many characters from the show were completely deleted from the film.  Fans have been demanding these lost scenes for years now.  I don't know if these scenes would really clear anything up, but they'd certainly be fun to see.  Lets hope it happens.  All in all, an interesting movie if you've seen the show, and a confusing and seemingly pointless movie if you haven't."
123,2.0,"Jason Voorhees is believed to be dead, but his murderous rampage lives on. He's able to transfer from body to body, but each host deteriorates at an incredible rate and he has to switch frequently. Meanwhile, Steven goes to meet Diana one night, who happens to be his ex-wife's mother. She has something very important to tell Steven. You see, Diana is the sister of Jason Voorhees and Jessica, Steven's ex, is his niece. Steven and Jessica have a baby named Stephanie, as well. According to Creighton Duke, a bounty hunter, the only way anyone can kill Jason is by destroying his heart and it has to be done by a blood relative. Not only that, but he can also be reborn by transferring into the body of another Voorhees. So after Diana is killed in a scuffle with ""Jason,"" that only leaves Jessica and Stephanie. Steven has no choice, but to protect his family even though he's believed to be the one who killed Diana and has the police hot on his trail every step of the way.

For a Friday the 13th film, the acting in this is surprisingly good. It still has a few actors that make you groan, but the actors who get the most face time are decent and get the job done. In fact, I probably would've rated this a few points higher if it wasn't for a few factors. The main one being that Jason is a worm. That's right. A freaking worm. Not only that, but he's like this demonic worm thing that the worms in Dreamcatcher would probably find attractive. If they hadn't tried to give Jason this supernatural explanation and had something else in its place, this would have been a lot better. Jason, like the actual Jason with the hockey mask, is really only in the film for maybe ten to fifteen minutes tops. So that hurts the film, in my eyes. They also made Jason make all these weird noises this time around. He was wheezing, breathing heavily, groaning, and grunting. It didn't fit the character. He was generally silent up until this film and is again in Jason X. So...what the hell? It's a disappointing sendoff overall for a film labeled as The Final Friday. I guess it wasn't completely pointless. We did get the Freddy Vs Jason tease at the end, which wasn't really followed up on for ten years. But I digress...

Filmed in Black and White, it depicts what could happen in a ""do as you are trained"".  Henry Fonda gives such a convincing role as the President of the United States and Larry Hagman, man, ""JR Ewing"" really comes through with a masterful performance in this movie, playing the role of interpreter for the President.  The movie was filmed concerning a fictitious runaway, rigid, military machine following orders no matter what the circumstances are which leads the world to the brink of destruction, a topic I always worried about as a kid.  Excellent movie....Walther Mathau also delivered on an excellent role as played.  Glad I have this in my collection."
129,5.0,"wow. the toxic avenger. what an amazing freaking movie! if there is one film that defines 80's cinema, i feel that its the toxic avenger. the film is about a nerd janitor named melvin who is constantly harrased by  everyone at the tromaville health club were he works. he receives the most torment from 4 hit and run drivers, one of whom tricks melvin into dressing in a tutu and meeting her at the pool were everyone is waiting to laugh at him. melvin is chased through the health club before jumping out a window and landing in a barrel of misplaced toxic waste. this transforms him into the toxic avenger or toxie for short. its now toxies job to fight crime in tromaville and get revenge on the 4 creeps who transformed him into a monster. the toxic avenger is a very,very entertaining film that althoughis full of violence and sensitive subject matter, is still very funny. the best parts of the film are toxies fights with the deranged criminals of tromaville. his first fight is against 3 drug dealers who are about to kill a cop. another cool fight scene is against 3 insane freaks robbing a fast food rersaurant. besides these 2 fight scenes, the rest of the film is wildly enjoyable. gore hounds will be pleased as toxie smashes heads, tears limbs, gouges eyes and rips out the guts of every sadistic criminal he comes across. one infamous scene is were the 4 hit and run drivers run over a young boys head. even though this scene is pretty intense and disturbing, its not done to disturb the audience and the rest of the films violence is done in an over the top fashion. if you haven't seen the toxic avenger then trust me, you won't be dissapointed. my only complaint is that toxies revenge onthe 4 hit and run drivers should have been as gruesome as the rest of the films violence. they ran over a little kid and laughed about it! they should have been torn to peices, but they still get whats coming to em. the toxic avenger is one of my all time favorite films and i'm positive that once you see it you'll love it. get tromatized!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

A movie about a bunch of overweight kids taking over after their fat-camp is sold into the hands of a crazed lunatic is enough reason to watch, and while it's not the funniest or clever done comedy it's a great kids movie with enough laughs for us adults to enjoy along with them.  Plus, that blob thing is just too freaking cool!"
131,4.0,"THE STUFF bills itself as a horror film. In the first ninety seconds of the movie, an old man stumbles across a strange, white goo bubbling up out of a snow bank. Using old man logic, he eats a dollop of it, and finding it tasty, suggests to a friend that they mine it and sell it as food. Naturally. It turns out that The Stuff is both sentient and addictive, and The Stuff spreads as one of America's favorite snack foods.

I'm tempted to say that the movie is a satire on the mindless consumerism of capitalist culture (especially as it was manifest in the mid-eighties when the movie was released). There's almost no doubt that this kind of morality was on the filmmaker's minds -- there's a lot of fun poked at commercials, and there are at least half a dozen scenes where characters discuss the evils of The Stuff with big, name brand ads (Marlboro, McDonald's, and Mobile gas stations) featured prominently in the fore- and background. Aha! People are too crazy about hoarding ""stuff"" the movie seems to be saying in a message that's about as subtle as clown shoes.

The problem is that the plotting and story are so haphazard and chaotic that the satire is lost in sheer stupidity. The movie is more senselessly frenetic than a Prodigy music video played at double the speed. I'm pretty sure that the editor must have been on an heroic amount of coke, because the pacing and cohesion of the scenes is tissue thin. Characters appear out of nowhere. Events occur rapid fire with a sporadic sense of timing. Establishing shots are nearly nonexistent.

The really weird thing is that there's very obviously the mood that this is all supposed to make sense. Our protagonist -- a business spy/saboteur named Moe (played by an actor who -- very literally -- uses the exact same facial expression to convey everything from lust, horror, anger, fear, and relief) -- makes wild, logical leaps in fractions of a second, and the audience is expected to understand intuitively his train of thought. Like a five year-old kid trying to explain the plot of a Harry Potter film, the film obviously knows in its own mind what it's going for, but its execution is not just spotty: it's blotchy. It's the narrative equivalent of a Pollock painting. There's no telling what events lead to what causes, nor the motivation behind anyone's actions. And that applies just as much to The Stuff itself. The whole film is truly baffling.

So why four stars? Because it's freaking hilarious. If I thought for a second that this level of humor was intentional, this film would get five stars from me. And even though I'm a connoisseur of the B-, C-, and D-grade of MST3K style viewing material, I still rarely find a film that's as cheesily satisfying as this one. From the very first frame, when the old man inexplicably starts lapping up the strange white bubbling goo, you know this movie has no idea what it's doing, and the very fact that thousands of dollars and man hours were spent in bringing it to your screen makes it even sweeter than the eponymous dessert treat. The fact that it sincerely THINKS it's making sense -- and in a dark and insistent way -- makes its lunacy all the more poignant, adorable, and hilarious.

If you're a hardcore horror enthusiast who brooks no substitutes, stay away. But if you have a sense of humor about the world today, and if you're looking for a goofy film to riff on with your friends, and ESPECIALLY if you're searching for a wild card film to play on a Halloween party eve with some soused compadres, you can't do much better than this misguided, eighties treatise on consumer culture and pasty-white after-dinner treats."
132,4.0,"After the success, and then the crushing failure of temperence and Prohibition, I guess the Fun-Must-be-Bad-for-You crowd went after something they thought they had a little better chance at banishing-- or at least demonizing, and eventually legally prohibiting. When this film was made, pot was still legal, although it was an, um, hmmmm, exotic pleasure that wasn't familiar to most middle class whites, who were happy with their scotch, thank you.
I seriously doubt that Reefer Madness had much to do with the success of the anti-weed campaign, however. In fact, it may have set it back a few years. This movie is so stupid that the first time I saw it, I assumed it was a parody. Anyway, I hope the VHS is good quality; me, I own a 16mm print.
Obviously no one who worked on this film has ever been high. Or even drunk. Heck, I doubt anyone who worked on this film has ever spun around in a circle until he felt dizzy. My favorite part is the hardcore addict sucking on his doobie like a dying emphysematic sucking on an oxygen tube, all the time shaking and giggling at a private joke.
I won't give away the ""plot,"" such as it is, but the nice middle class kids here are doing things after a couple of tokes that would drive most heroin addicts to the nearest methadone program.
By the way, that reefer, if you didn't know it, is a gateway drug to listening to jazz music, and implicitly to association with such low-lifes as dealers, addicts and musicians. (An' mebbe dem culored people as well.) This movie is everything that's wrong with didacticism.
But it's so freaking silly, that everything it says is an antithesis. If this film is racist, then racism must be wrong. If the film looks down on jazz, then jazz must be pretty cool.
Don't watch this alone, however. You need a friend to keep assuring you that you aren't hallucinating."
133,5.0,"This is an amazingly realistic feeling historical drama. It seems like the director really went out of their way to show not only the glamorous bits, but also the kind of grubby parts of life in the 19th century. You see shots of sheep, mud, and poor people through out. The costuming is just freaking amazing, beautiful, but still look like they've been worn (especially the navy uniforms).

The two leads are wonderful as are many of the supporting actors (love the wicked sister and slimy cousin!)

This has less glamor than some newer productions but much more heart."
134,5.0,"In ""The Brothers McMullen,"" the three grown (Irish-American) sons of an alcoholic, hilariously stupid, complete bozo of a father reunite and Do The Bonding Thing.  All three have female-related issues and problems to rival those of, for example, the president of the United States from 1993 to 2001 -- what was his name again?  AAANY-who, they are all forced to live under one roof for a few weeks, and must come to terms with all kinds of things.  This movie is not ""Terms of Endearment,"" however.  It is funny, irreverent, and light-hearted without being fluff.
The generation portrayed in this film is, in a lot of ways, the first generation of Irish Americans in their particular family to be coming to terms with the manifold social issues pertaining to the great American melting pot.  One brother is having huge problems with the stringent demands of the Irish brand of Catholicism, which are uproariously exacerbated by his relationship with a nice young Jewish American Princess, who wants him to move into her house with her extended family, and go to work for her daddy in the garment district.  The second brother seems to be unable to understand how nice it can be, and how worth fighting for, to have a college-educated, intelligent woman (a standout, very cool performance by Connie Britton [probably my favorite performance in the movie]) as a wife.  The third brother (Edward Burns) is sort of the stereotypical Irish ne'er do well writer, who drinks too much, and fears commitment like the Black Death, but who has inexplicably attracted the unwavering love of the flabbergastingly bodacious Maxine Bahns...  Anyway, I myself had an interesting viewpoint on this movie.  Want to hear it?  Well too bad, I'm going to tell you anyway.  Watching this movie, I felt like what might have been a child of Mike McGlone's character and his non-Irish girlfriend from the first part of the movie.  I saw this with my Irish American father and a couple of his brothers...  It's sort of sad in some ways -- they expect me and my siblings to have a visceral understanding of many of the jokes about Catholicism, Irish drinking, etc.  As the first generation in my family to be a good old American mutt, of mixed ethnicity, and having grown up in your standard white bread suburb, (okay, a Boston suburb, so mostly Irish, but still..) there were many things in this movie I couldn't have a personal reaction to.  The movie speaks to the sociological issues of a family at a particular stage in the acculturation process in becoming Americans -- and a very early stage at that.  I don't mean to make too huge a deal out of this, but the fact is that the Mike McGlone character -- by leaps and bounds the most conscientious brother -- is facing some very real problems in this movie, in terms of possibly giving up Catholicism, etc.  Not that becoming neurotic and freaking out about them is such a hot response, but at least he is aware of them.
But moving on -- this is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by a bunch of guys with their buddies, over a case of Guiness, yet can equally be appreciated by women.  No one would call this a chick flick, but women can enjoy it.  As a matter of fact, because there are no explosions or car cases, or, on the other hand, no weepy emotional scenes, this movie can actually be enjoyed in mixed company, sort of like ""Jerry Maguire"" or ""Beautiful Girls.""  Anyway, I enjoyed this a lot, and I recommend it to anyone.  Two thumbs up."
135,5.0,"Dr. Caligari presents the viewer with a frightening vision of the world through the lens of German Expressionism.

I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It's truly fascinating. And, it really (really) is an art film, since it purposefully and strikingly exhibits the new art of the German inter-war milieu. So, be prepared for an other-worldly excursion into the ""total work of art,"" or Gesamtkunstwerk, of this monumental and influential film.

This film is best seen at night, alone, and with the modern soundtrack which is available on the fully restored version. If the DVD you're watching does not have (a) choice of two soundtracks (traditional music and much-scarier modern track), (b) tinted inter-titles set in a surrealistic (actually expressionistic) font, and (3) is fairly high quality, then send it back and get the restored version. The quality and completeness of silent films are a major factor in experiencing the art form as it was meant to be experienced. The modern sound track in Dr. Caligari makes the film much more accessible for modern audiences (the eerie effects in the modern track heighten the feel of the film for the modern viewer) - try both tracks, you'll see.

It's surprising how frightening and impactful this film can be. You will have dreams about it, I promise. These between-the-wars German films are riddled with creepy foreshadowing for us in the present, who know what was about to happen in Germany.

Anyway, I think the film is best viewed with NO NOTICE. You don't really want to know the plot (the meaning of the end of the film can be interpreted in radically different ways - keep that in mind when it happens). Only one note - artistically the German Expressionist movement is worth reading about after you see the film - you'll notice the theme of ""death and the maiden"" woven into this artwork. Also, this film is the direct ancestor of films like ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and a lot more - you'll recognize the Expressionist look in many presentations in television and film.

WARNING - I would NOT show this film to children. It's very subtly and psychologically undermining - you'll be thinking and freaking about this thing for months to come - such a thing shouldn't be experienced by children - it's an adult, art film (no, not that kind) made for adults."
136,4.0,"A nice Thursday evening spent with the third member of Sid army inspired yet another 90's B horror review from the North pole's ultimate B enthusiast. It's been a few non-review weeks due to a surplus in orders thanks to this whole Christmas in July non-sense. Obviously we all know Christmas only comes once a year baby! Yet we've been hard at work filling Santa's orders, but have found a little down time again now that July's coming to a close. What better way to celebrate then with a 90's B horror starring Ally Sheedy and Lance Hendrickson? It's an extremely odd pairing but comes together nicely like red hots and knock off M&M's from sizzler eaten out of your sweat short pockets. The film is truly the type of B we look for in every sense. In so many ways it was so awful which is what makes it so perfect. We all know the old adage ""it's so bad it's good."" This is a motto we've centered our lives around.

Man's best friend starts out with news reported Ally Sheedy who sneaks into a animal testing lab to expose the cruel experiments. During her search she comes across a giant, very friendly pooch named Max. As she's telling Max ""c'mon baby you know your the girl of my dreams"" Lance Hendrickson burst in full of rage like he's hunting down Pumpkinhead. Since Andrew Clark wasn't there to wrestle Lance so freaking bad, they had no choice but to high tail it out of their with the dog close by. What Ally doesn't know is this dog's a scientific freakshow compiled with genes from every animal on the planet. He can run as fast as a cheetah, blend into things like a chameleon, has the strength of a bear, and can climb trees like a ring tail lemur. This is a dog you don't want to F with. Obviously the dog goes mental and eats a cat, kills a mail man then burries him under the deck, clips Ally's boyfriends breaks...then later kills him, and kills the scientist. However you really pull for the dog the whole time, poor bast**d never saw it coming.

So to sum it up, Man's Best friend is some top choice grade A meat in the 90's B horror field. Sure it was laughable and never even close to scary but that's what a true good B consists of. The film had so many parts that made you feel as if you were watching a kids movie, especially when they played a B cover of puppy love while Max tried to score with the neighbors dog. It would then switch gears from playful to straight up insane in the blink of an eye. Completely all over the place in the best way possible. For the movie snobs this film will simply not be in your comfort zone. It's not scary and not enjoyable unless you can kick back and enjoys it's Bness. But honestly, if you're expecting to be scared by this movie you've already got a nice stocking full of issues."
137,2.0,"While the art is beautiful and the story is interesting, The english voice acting cast really ruined this film. Their tones were so flat and didn't convey the slightest hint of emotion. They sounded as if they were bored out of their freaking mind and it ruined the movie for me."
138,5.0,"Alright here is the Deal Guyver 1 the 1st movie was alright. But Guyver 2 Dark Hero is a BIG STEP UP!! It is a great movie. Acting is somewhat kinda iffy sometimes. But good non the less! I was dissapointed that Guyver III wasn't in the movie. I mean I figred sence they did the 1st one they would bring more people from the original anime adult cartoons. Over all freaking 5 stars its one of the best movies out there. I say buy this and buy the DVD Set for the Anime version I kinda think it's better than the movies. And if you are pleased with Dark Hero and all 12 episodes, then get the 1st live action Guyver movie."
139,1.0,"This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life! Video Renters Beware, you wouldn't want to rent this movie because of how stupid it is. It was so freaking boring and stupid I wouldn't even want to pay attention to this movie one more time! I HATE it!"
140,5.0,"Rate the X files? This needs a rating? Cmon son, it's the freaking X files. Awesome show."
141,3.0,"I was glad to see Apple finally release the 1995 Beatles Anthology set on DVD recently. The whole collection is packaged neatly into a tidy five CD box set.
The picture could have been remastered a bit better however, the quality is grainy and not as sharp as I'd hoped. The sound quality is done fairly well, but I found it most irritating that whenever the program cuts to song, the volume literally doubles! Either you hear the spoken dialog in whispers, and hear the music at a comfortable level, or else you hear the spoken dialog, while having your eardrums blasted with intercuts of song! We love their music, don't get me wrong, but turn the freaking volume down guys!
I also feel that the Anthology in general spends FAR too much time focussing on the Beatles' earliest days. Most Beatles fans would have rather had more attention spent on the Beatles' latter years and material, when their artistic merit was at its peak. The scratchy, raw, early tracks should have been treated as ""bonus material"", not the main course in my opinion. As it is, two of the five disks in the set, [the first two], I'll most likely not watch very much.
What would have been nice is an extra CD of every Beatles ""video"" (they called them ""promo-clips"" in those days), in their entirety, uninterrupted. This would have included such ""videos"" as ""Lady Madonna"", ""Strawberry Fields"", ""Penny Lane"", Paperback Writer"", ""Rain"", ""Hey Bulldog"", ""Revolution"", and more...I think, as Beatles fans, we're all pretty sick of watching these legendary Beatles ""videos"" as badly digitized, low-res, downloaded MPGs - right fellow fans?
I can onlly give this set three stars. It could have been better. I expected more. It's still a must-have for all Beatles fans, but I wanted the ultimate and sadly, this isn't it."

144,5.0,"This is a really creative and talented way to show Eddie Murphy's total skills.  He sings, he acts he's freaking hilarious.  This movie is laugh out loud funny and I think it's a must see for anyone above the age of 14 lol."
145,4.0,"This is basically a sci fi version of ""the classic western ""High Noon"", set  on a space mining colony.  Nice companion piece to go with ""Alien"". Also a great movie to inspire sci-fi role playing gamers. The art direction really puts you in the story, even though Connery's performance here is uneven and sometimes wooden. The supporting cast, especially Peter Boyle as the heavy, are great. The sense of a man alone without backup, against heavy odds, is really well-communicated. He's a bit miscast as the sherif, but he's Sean freaking Connery, so you don't question it."
146,3.0,"After rewatching COBRA after an interval of many years, I didn't know whether to rate it one star, because its so ridiculously, God-awfully silly, stupid and over-the-topor to rate it five stars for that exact same reason. So I compromised and gave it three.

Marion Cobra Cobretti would hate me for that. He doesnt like compromise.

In fact, Marion Cobra Cobretti doesnt like much of anything, except chewing on matchsticks, driving his 50s muscle car, and mowing down criminals like a drunken redeck knocking tin cans off a fence with a machine gun. Who is Marion Cobra Cobretti, you ask? Well, if Clint Dirty Harry Eastwood and Charles Death Wish Bronson had a baby, and that baby was Godfathered by Arnold Commando Schwarzenegger, the answer would be Marion Cobra Cobretti, the head (and seemingly almost the only member of) The Zombie Squad, an LAPD detective unit called in when wishy-washy nonsense like Miranda and the Bill of Rights fail. And at the films opening, Cobra (Sylvester Stallone) is called in to deal with a psycho who has just shot up a grocery store at Christmas. This displeases Cobrettis immediate boss, wishy-washy Monty (Andrew Robinson), who knows where Cobretti goes, a litter of spent shell casings and bloody corpses will follow. But F Monty and those bleeding heart liberal reporters, because the truth is that crime is a disease, and Cobra is the cure  so he tells the psycho before first stabbing and then finally riddling him with bullets. Afterwards, the reporters ask if this killing had any connection to the Night Slasher case. Monty says no, which of course means that there IS a connection to whatever the hell the Night Slasher case may be, and that the Cobra will soon discover what it is.

(Behind those mirrored shades lies the investigative savvy of a Sherlock Holmes, believe me.)

But who is the Night Slasher, you ask? The Night Slasher (Brian Thompson) is the jut-jawed leader of a gang of homicidal maniacs who go out every night and viciously murder Angelinos with sharp or blunt instruments, evidently for the hell of it. He spews nonsense about creating a new world by slaughtering the weak but really, hes just evil scum  precisely the sort of scum Cobrettis .45 ACP slugs were made to splatter all over downtown Los Angeles. And when the Slashers gang drops the ball (or rather, the axe) by leaving a witness alive to one of its random slayings, the ball gets a-rollin. See, ole Slasher has what you might call an unforgettable face  it screams I AM THE NIGHT SLASHER, ASK ME ABOUT MY DISMEMBERMENT SPECIALS. So naturally he wants to locate this witness, a model named Ingrid (Bridgette Nielsen at her most horror-movie hapless) and hack her into chum before she can finger him. And Cobra, see, he doesnt want this, so you just know the two men  Slasher n Cobra  are gonna butt their sweaty, furrowed brows.

What follows is the sort of wanton mayhem only the 1980s, mingled with Stallone, could possibly produce. People get impaled. Vehicles get wrecked. Millions of bullets get expended. And Sly grates out stone-faced one-liners while setting people on fire. Seriously, the last twenty or so minutes of this film feature a freaking WW2 movie level of violence, with what seems like hordes of motorcycle-riding psychos testing out the dubious theory that leather biker jackets can stop submachinegun rounds, and Bridgette Nielsen reminding us why her career lasted about as long as a Viagra erection (four hours if you believe the commercials). But don't sweat it, folks, because what would traumatize you for life is just another day in the life of Marion Cobra Cobretti, a man so tough he slices his pizza with scissors!

COBRA is either a great awful movie or just a greatly awful one. Stallone, not exactly known for the subtlety of his worldview, is essentially remaking DIRTY HARRY here  even going so far as to cast two men who were in that film, Robinson and Reni Santoni  but the fact is, as iconic as Sly is, hes no Clint Eastwood, and no amount of burning gasoline, spent gunpowder and roasting human flush can mask the stench coming off the crappy acting, horrible writing and submoronic plot of this film. The difference between a hugely entertaining bad movie like COMMANDO and one which causes you to hold your head in your hands and make feeble groaning noises is subtle, but its there, and COBRA too-often strays into the latter category, probably because Sly, unlike Arnold, did not know at this stage of his career the secret of how to make fun of himself and boast at the same time. But if you're in the right mood  bloodthirsty, silly, 80s-nostalgic  you will probably enjoy the antics of Marion Cobra Cobrettiat least until you can lay your hands on a copy of RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART TWO."
147,5.0,"The good news is that this is one of the most frightening horror movies ever made. The bad news is that it was supposed to be a musical comedy. (Bad comedies are painful, bad musicals are worse, and combining the two, then adding in liberal sexual innuendo involving an eighty-five year old former sexpot is agony.) But Sextette is never boring. It can't be...there's virtually a new TERROR around every corner!

This unbelievably misguided project from director Ken Hughes and screenwriter Herbert Baker takes Mae West's 1926 play SEX and reimagines it as a romance between the 85-year old West and 32-year old Timothy Dalton. And while Mae and her latest hubbie (future James Bond star, Dalton) lounge around their palatial honeymoon suite, Mae reminisces about her past conquests while a roster of escapees from the Hollywood Squares stumble through.

There's the always-confused Ringo Starr as a Stroheim-like director; leather-skinned George Hamilton as a pinstriped gangster; Alice Cooper in a permed `Barry Manilow-style' wig and tuxedo; Keith Moon as a foppy fashion designer; plus Dom DeLuise, George Raft, Regis Philbin, Rona Barrett -- the list of has-beens and never-will-be's goes on and on ...and on!  Meanwhile, the viewer gets to grind their teeth at the loose excuse for a plot, in which the U.S. government begs Mae to spend a night with one of her ex's, a Russian bigwig (Tony Curtis), in order to save diplomatic relations.

But the show really belongs to its octogenarian leading lady, (who at this point in her life must have been giving her corset-maker hazard pay), in her final and most astounding screen role. The most bizarre thing about Sextette is that it pretends that its star is still in her twenties! and has her firing off racy double-entendres that will make every viewer nauseous with their quasi-necrophilic implications. The star is filmed in such soft-focus that one can barely make out her face. She shambles across the sets like she's about to fall over, and when she recites trademark zingers like, ""I'm the girl who works at Paramount all day and Fox all night,"" (Say it out loud), she seems to have forgotten what they mean. The most horrifying exchange comes when she caresses her breasts provocatively, causing Dalton to embrace her and break into an ear-melting rendition of ""Love Will Keep Us Together.""

YES! Just when you think it's as cheesy as it could ever possibly get, the entire cast breaks into song and dance, and you remember it's also a freaking musical! You haven't lived until you've heard Dom DeLuise creaking out a cover of the Beatles' ""Honey Pie""? Other low lights have West crooning ""Happy Birthday"" while pawing a 21-year-old youth in a gym full of Olympic bodybuilders and lip-synching another standard to which she appears to have forgotten the words. And we'll bet you thought AT LONG LAST LOVE was interminable!...

The whole mess ends with West singing ""Babyface"" (astonishingly, she's referring to herself) and sneaking onto Dalton's yacht for a really sick-making seduction scene. We'd like to tell you that the movie has a happy ending, (if having sex with an eighty-five year-old woman qualifies as ""happy"") but the viewer's side of the experience is something far less pleasant.

Sextette is a jaw-droppingly Bad Move We Love that separates true worshipers of heinous cinema from the fainthearted. It is defiantly one for the record books, and most certainly not recommended for viewing on an empty stomach."
148,5.0,I didn't read the book but thought I understood the concept before watching the movie.  It's just freaking creepy.  Loved it!  Highly recommend it!
149,5.0,"As an author who likes to look for little gems that delve into the creepy, I found Cry of the Cat to be a good Goosebumps film which packs in a few scares along the way.

In the film, Allison, a rising actress, is in the middle of filming a B-Horror movie called Cry of the Cat. At one point, she becomes annoyed after a mechanical malfunction occurs on the set. As a result, the filming crew is sent off on lunch break while repairs are made. While on her break however, she accidentally runs over a cat with her bike, but is unable to locate its carcass after the collision. She eventually tracks its owners down and discovers that the cat she ran over isn't like other cats. In fact, the one she hit is called Rip, a mutated cat creature which was created at the hands of a mad scientist.  Allison is skeptical at first and blows the story off when she hears it.

Back at the studio, however,  Allison is confronted by Rip several times as she continues to film scenes for the movie. After being scratched by him and freaking out on the set, the director begins to believe that Allison may need to be replaced by a more stable actress. When she tries to explain that it's Rip  causing her to behave erratically, nobody believes her. They think she's an overly ""dramatic"" actress. Worried that she could be fired from the film, Allison tries to carry on despite her fears over Rip.

Eventually  she's let go from the film.  But she and her co-star come up with a plan to stop the cat by going back to the place where Rip was created. Twists and turns occur while they encounter Rip yet again until the film comes to a conclusion, I won't spoil it for you.

Well I have to say that this was a pretty good story for a Goosebumps tale. Let me explain why. For one, it actually creates a creepy atmosphere throughout the film which helps set the mood. True, the story centers around a film crew filming a horror movie, but that only helps to accentuate the horror Allison is going through as she's terrorized by Rip.

The other element I found interesting was the primadonna attitude the film crew had with one another while they were on the set. Everyone seems to think they are the best thing around since the invention of the wheel. It's played out numerous times as they banter back and forth about calling their agents or ripping on how they hate working on the film. It's actually quite humorous, but it also reinforces the belief that most people have when they think of folks who work in Hollywood. That alone makes the film a little more interesting from a social aspect.

Allison's struggle of dealing with Rip while worrying about being fired works well too. It creates a whole new crisis for her which gnaws on her both physically and emotionally. At that point, you actually start to feel sorry for her character.

As for the acting and special effects, well this is a Goosebumps production from the 90s. However, I felt the acting was decent considering the target audience which was 8-12 year olds. The special effects were wanting, but again, we're talking about the 90s and the audience isn't supposed to be teens watching a slasher film. So the special effects are appropriate if you consider that aspect.

Overall I'm giving this film 5 stars. I think it pushed the limits for tween horror at the time but still managed to bring an interesting story to life. The characters worked well too for the most part. I almost wish they had made a Cry of the Cat 2. It would have been interesting to see Allison in another encounter with Rip. But this film is one of the better Goosebumps films overall in my opinion and is worth a watch if you liked Goosebumps back in the day, or if you like light horror stories in general. Worth a watch or possible purchase."
150,1.0,"I am die-hard fan of the original Sailor Moon and the Manga, but the English version, just sucks. Here is the
 list of complaints......
1. The voices. THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS, THEY HAVE THE VOICES OF TWENTY AND THRITY YEAR OLD WOMEN. Plus the nature of the voices dosen't suit the characters at all. Usagi(serena) sounds like thiry year old woman. Ami (Amy) also sounds like a thirty year old woman. Rei (raye) sounds like she has a permanat frog in her throught. Makoto (lita) sounds like she has a congested nose. Minkako (mina) sounds like another thirty year old women. Luna sounds like a freaking old english granny *shoot me* Also Marmoru or Endyimions (darien or prince darien's) voice sounds like a ten-year-old when he is supposed to be a collage student.
2. Sever and usless editing. Every episode has so many pointless edits it is not even funny. Ever heard of putting for ages so-and so-. The scene where Prince Endyimion is stabbed is taked out. Also the last English episode was originally one episode in Japan. They said that the senshi(scouts) were taken to the Negaverse, but the die. And this makes it seem like they are going on a vacation. The original entrence and exit songs are replaced with the English stuff which is awfull. Kunzite's (malachite's) death was...., there is no word to as how stupid it was
3. Music. This DVD has absolutely no qualiy in music, what-so-ever. The theme songs is just a bung of little girls singing 'she is the one named sailor moon' over and over and over and over again; it drives me crazy. They sing the same song the the entrence and exit songs, which drives me nutts too.
4. Unlike original this version is just plain boring after a while. In the original this is non-stop action, yet here it is lets-take-our-time.
Actually I could go on for hours with how much is wrong with this DVD. I am a die-hard anime fan, and with dubbing in English this seris was dubbed very poorly. There could of been a lot more effort into making it have much better quality. Don't waist your hard earned money on this peice of junk."

Anyways ya rent it~"
152,4.0,"""Emma"" was made during a spate of Jane Austen films and miniseries awhile back, and thankfully (except for the fiasco called ""Mansfield Park"") all of them have been fantastic. Gwyneth Paltrow provides some droll comic relief as the title heroine of the movie ""Emma,"" proving that yes, she CAN act quite well.
Emma Woodhouse (Paltrow) is on a matchmaking rush after she successfully pairs her former governess to a rich widower. Convinced that she can make a good match for anybody, she sets out to pair her penniless, sweet-natured pal Harriet Smith (Toni Collette) with someone more elevated than a prosperous young farmer, such as the eager young minister, Mr. Elton (Alan Cumming). Problem is, Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma, not Harriet.
More romantic complications ensue when a charming bad boy, Frank Churchill (Ewan McGregor in a bad wig) comes to the area and seems to be interested in Emma -- until Emma decides to pair him with Harriet. Emma's good-natured meddling continues unchecked, until it threatens her own happiness and her unspoken love.
""Emma"" is probably the frothiest of Austen's novels; there aren't any big scandals or anything like that.  Embarrassment is the big opponent in here, but Douglas McGrath has a good sense of how to use the droll humor to best advantage. This is definitely a comedy, except for one or two moments near the end; even there, it's amusing when Emma wails ""I love John! I hate John!"". The only source of humor that falls flat is Mrs. Elton, who is too overdone in her vulgarity and stupidity. Bit of a cheap laugh there.
Gwyneth Paltrow seems very in-her-element as Emma, managing to be cute and fumbling without ever making Emma seem precious or stupid. Ewan McGregor may hide whenever he sees his performance, but he's pretty good as Frank (and fans of his should definitely see him sing a duet with Paltrow -- he has a wonderful voice). Toni Collette is sweet as Emma's rather naive younger friend, Denys Hawthorne endearing as Emma's hypochondriac dad (he's kind of weird, but likeably so), Alan Cumming annoying as the juvenile Mr. Elton, and Greta Scacchi does a great turn as Emma's kindly mother-figure. And Jeremy Northam steals the show as Mr. Knightley, the barb-tongued aristocrat with a kindly heart and a genuine affection for Emma, even though her romantic prodding makes him nuts.
There are a few points in the movie where it does seem a little too light and frothy, but fortunately most of the time the direction stays in sync with the storyline.  The lighting, the costumes, the music -- all of them are cute and lightweight. Kids can watch this as well as adults, since there are Disney cartoons that are more offensive than this. (But younger kids will be bored out of their skulls, probably)
""Emma"" is a great film for anyone in search of a genuine comedy with lots of laughs and no stupid gags. Definitely something to watch, especially if you like hearing Ewan McGregor sing or Gwyneth Paltrow freaking out over a failed matchmaking."
153,5.0,"Skip all that balderdash about Edward G. Robinson's 'Little Caesar"" as being ""iconic"", ""genre-defining"", or ""prototypical"".

It's a great movie, made about gangsters when that problem was a fresh, topical, current one. ""Ripped from the headlines"" is exactly the truth here.

Robinson's performance is flat-out one of the greats of cinema. His ""Rico"" lives and breathes on screen like few others from the early days of sound film.

Remember, this is a sweet little Jewish gentleman from Turkey, playing a mercurial, merciless Italian mobster.

You'd never know.

His rise from gas station robber to gangland king is, yes, the standard story you all know by heart. But I could not for a moment take my eyes off Rico. The cockiness, the menace, the desperation...the rat-tat-tat delivery of the lines mimicking the tommy gun sound so new to film during that era.

Douglas Fairbanks looks elegant in his role as the partner who wants to get out of the ""biz"". The other bad guys have great ""faces"" for their roles, but to be honest, most of them display a ""staginess"" or artificial quality that only makes Robinson more real, more alive.

The transfer does have some spots where it looks like a film from the 30's, but to be fair, there are many more reels that look pretty freaking sweet...just gorgeous, with crisp details and smooth grays.

The short (17 minute) doc does a great job of placing the film in a proper perspective, and fully enhances your appreciation for the film. The ""Warner Night At The Movies"" again is outstanding, with a newsreel featuring the girlfriend of the murdered gangster ""Legs"" Diamond, a nice short featuring a young Spencer Tracy,and a black & white cartoon that characterizes that time period. There's also a trailer for a film where Robinson doesn't play a gangster, which is kinda neat.

Five stars? For the DVD? Oh yeah...easy."
154,4.0,"...this is Steven Seagal at his Steven Seagaliest. What do I mean by that? It's perhaps the silliest of his early films plot-wise (apart from his directorial debut abomination On Deadly Ground, anyway), it shows him at his most invincible (getting away from multiple bad guys while on a hospital gurney), it's got some of his best lines (""This is for my wife. *beep* you and die!"") and he's at his most over-the-top I-can-do-everything-I'm-Steven-freaking-Seagal throughout.

Basically he's an undercover cop whose family gets blown away early on after he discovers a deep mob connection involving a Senator (William Sadler, kind of wasted here). And Seagal (as ""Mason Storm"", one of his best names) is blown away too - except he lives, in a coma, somehow hidden completely away from public knowledge despite being in a regular hospital, for 7 years. Then he comes to in the presence of uber-babe Kelly LeBrock (Mrs. Steven Seagal in real life for several years) and starts trying to escape the baddies, find his old friends who can help him get the dirt on the Senator out in public, etc etc. Along the way he finds time to show off his knowledge of languages, a Seagal trademark (Chinese here), demonstrate lots of martial arts, show his Buddhist teachings (promptly to be ignored when it's time to do some killin'), and generally do plenty of bad acting and ass-kicking.

It's not really a ""good"" movie, even by low-budget action movie standards it's hardly great, but if you're a Seagal fan (and what conscious human isn't?) it is one of the must-sees; only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-for-Justice/dp/0790740834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out for Justice</a>&nbsp;is more fun overall I think, and that one actually IS a (pretty) good movie, with Seagal's acting being pretty close to competent, a great villain, and good New York location work.

DVD NOTE:  Seagal's movies have been endlessly repackaged in 2fers, 4-packs and the like; obviously there's no reason to spend boucoup bucks on just this one alone.  It's most often been put together with SS' previous (and first) film ABOVE THE LAW, as in this package:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steven-Seagal-Collection-Above-the-Law-Hard-to-Kill/dp/B001T21R5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steven Seagal Collection: Above the Law/Hard to Kill</a>&nbsp;which seems like it might be your best bet at the moment I'm writing this (April 2011)."
155,5.0,"The word ""hell"" is spoken in a G rated Disney movie. Strange art style. Dark and serious tones. For kids! I grew up with the old style Disney where the bad guys were horribly frightening. I think this movie takes the cake. Prince Phillip stabs Maleficent through the heart! Disney Movie!

Have you seen the steelbook version? It is freaking beautiful. Oh yes, I will have it. I am crazy enough to pay that much but this is one, if not THE one, of my Disney favorites."
156,5.0,"This was a fanfreaking tastic badly made movie. The kids (10 and 8) and my wife all watched this and everyone laughed, hysterically. The best possibly are the police men who disappear in the sand, the shot of them looking at the camera, throwing their arms up and then falling, PRICELESS. The appearance of all brainwashed people lags between a hangover and wicked constipation, another hysterical review.

The actual martians, not the leader in the orb, are easily spotted by bad costumes and their zippers as they run in the ""tunnel""

BEST OF ALL, weatch out for smart kids who figure out saucers ans alien weapons in mere seconds...look out Mars!!"
157,5.0,"The German Blu-ray looks great; its a very noticeable improvement over the DVD.
I think Lost Highway is easier to understand then people think.
In interviews with David Lynch, he talks about the OJ Simpson murder case, how, in his mind, OJ was indeed guilty, and what he must have to create in his mind to live a normal life after such a violent and horrific act.
Lynch also said, the film is very much about psychogenic fugue (now known as Dissociative fugue).
So, taking what Lynch said, and reading about the symptoms of Dissociative fugue, I have come up with my own interpratation of the movie.
The first shot we see, is Fred Madisons (Bill Pullman) fugue (Latin for flight) as he drives the dark highway. The film has begun even as the credits roll, and Fred has already killed his wife and lover.
The entire film, save for the opening shot, and last scene where the cops have caught on, and are in hot pursuit, is happening in his mind.
The video images represent reality, something Fred wants to escape from; they show the evidence of his guilt. Fred re-interprets reality and invents identities. He wants to remember the events the way he likes to, not necessarily the way it happened.
All of this, the whole story in the film, is taking place in Freds mind, as he flees the scene in his car.
Fred is in a fugue state, until he slowly realizes, bit by bit, that he really did kill and dismember his wife.
So in the last scene, Fred is caught, and being chased by police, in real time. Freds fugue state ends in him completely freaking out, he is a monster, he can no longer escape into his idyllic Pete fantasy.
The last shot is the total mental breakdown of Freds mind.
Anyway, until something better comes along, thats how I read Lost Highway. Its actually less complex then I thought on my first viewing."
158,3.0,"The other day, on a whim, I decided to watch THE BLOB again after an interval of about 35 years. My first and only viewing of the film had come as a very small child, but oddly enough, I remembered much of it vividly and had the impression that it was a classic 50s horror movie which had helped launch the career of the then-unknown Steve McQueen. This turned out to be partially true. It did put McQueen on Hollywood's map, and it is a classic 50s horror movie -- of the distinctly B variety.

THE BLOB begins with Steve (McQueen) and Aneta (Jane Martin) doing the most American thing possible in the 50s -- parking in lover's lane in Steve's convertible. They witness a shooting star crash in the nearby forest, and, going to investigate it, discover someone has beaten them to the crash site -- a reclusive old man who foolishly poked the protoplasmic mass at the bottom of the impact crater and promptly watched it ooze over his hand. Taking the man to the local doctor (Stephen Chase), the lovers take off, thinking the episode over, but as it turns out the Blob has only just begun its rampage. Turns out it grows larger the more protein it consumes, and if there's one thing the anonymous little town McQueen lives in has plenty of, it's meat: recluses, doctors, nurses, mechanics, projectionists, theatergoers, and your little dog too. Putting this together much faster than anyone else is Steve, who spends a lot of time trying to convince the local constabulary that a monster is loose in the town; unable to make much headway he recruits his fellow teenagers, who rally to warn the townsfolk. By then, however, the Blob has grown to monstrous proportions and is threatening to consume everyone. Immune to gunfire, acid, electricity and fire, it keeps growing, and apparently has a sense of irony, for it eagerly sacks a midnight screening of some horror movies before trapping Steve and Jane in a diner. A way must be found to stop the monster before it grows too large to contain, and Steve has an idea, but will he able to share his theory before he's the Blob's next meal?

THE BLOB was an independently-made movie and obviously suffered from budget constraints. The writing is stiff, the acting is all over the place (the extras are all laughing and smiling as they flee The Blob) and even for the time the effects are not particularly good. And despite its modest length and extremely simple plot the film feels very slow, due to long boring and needless sequences which are everywhere in the movie and act as a constant brake on its pace, when what we really want to see is the Blob eating people. On top of this, the movie seems to be more interested in its 50s-era theme of ""teens vs. authority"" than the actual story, which is ""teens vs. The Blob."" And don't get me going on the theme song! Sounded more like a freaking Beach Blanket Bingo song than that of a horror movie.

On the other hand, the movie does have Steve McQueen, who even at his most inexperienced had that odd charisma that allows him to draw your attention even when he's staring vacantly into space, and I appreciated that one of the Blob's early nemeses, Doc Hallan, is a fully-drawn character the audience cares about, which is the last thing I'd expect to find in a horror movie, much less an old B horror movie. And the Blob is an interesting, even a unique, sort of monster. It has no intelligence, no personality, no motive other than to eat -- sort of like a college student who just smoked a big fat blunt. You can't sympathize with it, and you can't hate it. You just want to be elsewhere when it shows up.

In the end, I sort of wished I hadn't rewatched THE BLOB, because I remembered it as faster and scarier and all-around better. It's a classic B-movie, it undoubtedly set the scene for many future imitators, and I laughed out loud at the fact that it may feature the original horror movie trope of tropes -- the scene where the teen hero and heroine try to convince the bumbling sheriff that yes, there's a monster on the loose. Unfortunately it's too slow and boring to be really enjoyable. I don't mean to dismiss an iconic flick, but if you're in the mood for a proper monster movie from roughly the same era, you'd be better off watching THEM. At least it doesn't end with a question mark."
159,5.0,My family loves the Blob.  It's just scary enough to allow my toddlers to watch without freaking them all the way out.
160,2.0,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did but despite giving it every chance I could I just didn't like it. Now before all the fan boys get their panties in a bunch, i like 70's horror and Italian horror, that said this movie was objectively awful. The only saving grace for this movie was the gore effects which were actually pretty freakin awesome. The rest of this movie was just a trainwreck. The acting was literally the worst I have ever seen, the dubbing was terrible, the plot was nonsensical, the decisions made by people were insultingly bad, everything except the gore was bad.

First of all, the police sergeant or whatever in the beginning was the worst acting and dubbing combo Ive ever had the misfortune of seeing. Also this town looks to be a fairly heavily suburban east coast town that has its own psychiatrist and looks to even have townhouses and apartments, yet they expect us to believe it doesnt show up on any maps? Come on, seriously? Also at the end the police know the dead are coming back to life and theres a portal to hell that needs to be closed but they decide to say hey ""lets let the freaking psychiatrist, the reporter, and some crazy chick handle it."" what? Also the maggot scene drags on forever and the ""actors' don't seem to mind or even really react at all to having just been spreyed down with literally millions of maggots. they act completely normal afterwards. What? And then to top off the crap cake the ending was the most try hard, no sense making, stupid pile of crap Ive yet seen.

All in all don't watch this movie if you can avoid it, it took me 3 tries to get through and almost 4. The gore parts are pretty cool though so its hard for me to just say stay away no matter what but just know it will be a hard slog."
161,2.0,"What do you get when you put Steve McQueen in a Drive in Horror movie? Well quite simply you get this ""The Blob"". The blob, a story about a meteorite that crashes on earth and lets out a deadly gelatin, and guess what?, yes its hungry, and yes it gets bigger if it eats more...oh such unpredictability, no?

While this movie is no masterpiece, it is however a fun flick to laugh at. Practically the acting is very Low budgety. You can tell the actors are not taking the movie seriously in any way....I mean come on it's a freaking 50 ft piece of jelly...how serious can you get.

Its funny seen the future ""A"" actor being in this silly mess. Most of the time you can tell he can't hold his laughter...I don't blame him. If it surprises you the acting..Wait until you see the conclusion of it...it's so ridiculous.

I honestly would wait to catch this on Amc or TCM; there is really no need to buy it. Unless you are an avid fan of 50's monster movies. The movie is available in 2 editions. A bare bones DVD and a Criterion Collection DVD...why Criterion released a special edition is beyond me. But as I said this is just a movie to poke fun at. A much superior remake was released in the 80's.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5"
162,5.0,"I grew up watching horror films. I saw them too young and too many - and Michael Myers still scares the crap out me even when the film has nothing but crap left in itself. Writer Kevin Williamson clearly shares the same nervous fondness for the genre as myself (and clearly, many others) do - he has managed to make a movie that is both genuine scary movie and arch parody of scary movies. It's the film's very self-awareness that makes it different from all the rest. Instead of following the time-honored horror rules that it so carefully details, it leads them - the virgin is immune from death, we are told, but what if she gives it up! oh heavens that wasn't supposed to happen!

The movie begins with Drew Barrymore and goes somewhere totally different - and by the end you are so amazed that they took you there so adroitly, so smoothly, and yet with so many geniune yuks, you want to see it again! At least, that's how it was for me. The characters mock the very archetypes they end up playing - and they weave in and out of Red-Herringville with smooth abandon. A groovy cameo by the Fonz himself (as the high school principal) is a nice nod to we who have grown up freaking out that Freddy will come in our sleep. Watch for funny horror cameos and winks here and there.

My favorite moment involves parallel action between the characters' viewing habits and the reality all around them. I don't want to give anything away but it involves a van, Jamie Kennedy, and Jamie Lee Curtis. It sums up what I love about Scream. It's smart, but it's not too smart - it hands you some information and hides other information - it dances around, pointing you in the direction it wants, but upon repeat viewing it doesn't suffer like movies like The Game do.

Grab some friends, a big bowl of popcorn, check all the locks in your house...and obey all the rules! This movie makes 'em and breaks 'em! Woo hoo!"
163,5.0,"'Fire Down Below', or as I like to call it 'On Deadly Ground Again' because both films have identical plots, stars Lord Steven as an undercover EPA agent out to stop an evil country singer, Kris Kristofferson, from dumping toxic waste in Kentucky. Now, before I go any further, would anyone actually care and/or notice if evil country singers were dumping toxic waste in Kentucky?  I think not.  Most of those buck-toothed, barefoot hillbillies wouldn't even notice.

But I digress, The Lord goes undercover as, get this, a freaking carpenter to smoke out these so-called evildoers.  Seagal fixes at least fifty hillbilly's porches throughout the movie.  He hooks up with some long-in-the-tooth broad who killed her brother but he doesn't care because Steven likes killing people too, so its a match made in heaven. His Majesty is totally sweet here, he kills everbody, snaps approximately ninety wrists, kills Randy Travis(thank god) and wails on a guitar.  Totally sweet.

Steven Seagal is awesome."
164,5.0,"2047. Space exploration is still in its infancy where there are more mysteries than discovery. Man's attempt to reach the stars and beyond is at the cusp of this space horror opera in which Dr. Weir (eerily played by Sam Neill), has created a device to jump through space-time and reach distant points in space in a matter of moments.

Problem is, his pet project, in the form of a space exploration vessel, the Event Horizon, disappeared off the grid in 2040, only to reappear 7 years after the fact, the ship weather-beaten and crew dead, by means gruesome and unfathomable. A rag-tag crew is assembled to assess the lost ship and to gain knowledge of its missing years. When they arrive, they find a ghost ship with no idea as to what happened to the crew other than something out of Dante's Inferno. The bigger question: what exactly is the object that Weir has created and what has it brought back from beyond the stars?

Even Horizon is highly underrated. It combines classic science fiction with horror at is best and most memorable and chilling. Is it graphic and gore-filled? Absolutely. That's part of the point and the smoke and mirrors thrown in our faces will fool some but not all of us. The gore is good, solidly placed for maximum effect but never overdone. We get the expected slasher theme but under it, it's a psychological thriller. You're asked to think and not given the clues right away. You're forced to participate with the characters as they realize what is happening. That's how insidious it is, the subtext and the in your face gore. For most horror slasher films, it's all sensory and zero interpretation where the viewer isn't asked to contemplate anything...just watch, not think, and be grossed out. With this film, there is a PLOT--and that will seriously confound many. Everything meshes beautifully. It's disturbing but with a razor sharp edge and not at all meaningless.

What makes this movie even more effective is the unconventional cast, a group of talented actors who almost seem miscast in a horror film. You don't see talented, gifted actors like Sam Neill, Lawrence Fishburne, Kathleen Quinlan, Jason Issacs and Joley Richardson in a horror movie, let alone together. The secondary cast are also solid, and the entire whole complements each other. You're immediately grounded with all these characters, artfully depicted throughout as well as effortlessly acted, and you feel for them. They get in your head. They are not nameless objects of bloody fodder but meant to matter, to convey the overlying message that what you think you know of your worst fears, is waaaaayyy past simplistic but of the stuff your imagination could never dream up on a bad day. It is not meant to question anything other than to tap into those base fears, to heighten the inherent dread of idea of hell itself. That's it. At its core, the philosophy is to scare. And they director and writer knew that they did us a favor and gave us much more. More importantly, it works. The devious, intelligent and unexpected plot, the smart direction, the frenetic and claustrophobic set and everything in between is in perfect harmony.

I own this movie. One of the few on my shelf. It's worth the money. I've watched it several times and I still flinch. I won't watch it unless someone else is with me. If I'm alone, and I want a good scare, I watch with the lights on and then have to watch something warm and fuzzy and opposite of what I've just experienced. You think you'll manage just fine. Sure, tell yourself that. Watch it alone, at night and then tell me you weren't freaked out. I know, I've heard it before. You've watched them all and none of it's surprised or even made you blink but be forewarned. Event Horizon will crawl right under your skin, sit there and then scare the everlasting crap at you.

An that, I think, is freaking AWESOME!"
165,5.0,"Event Horizon in my opinion is one of those under-appreciated classics (if something from the 90's can be considered classic). It works heavily on the psyche without showing too much. I fondly remember seeing it in the theaters in my high school years, and girls in my physics class freaking out at the very mention of an ""event horizon"" in class."
166,5.0,"The complaints against this movie just aren't fair. Some are saying it's too violent, too gruesome, but it simply isn't that gruesome. Yes, there's blood and gore, but it's not gratuitous, and during the most horrific scenes (the ""living autopsy"" near the end comes to mind) were censored. And, as a history lesson, this movie was massively cut and edited because test audiences felt the film was too violent in its original form. The director, Paul Anderson, constantly laments in the special features that he was forced to cut the parts he really wanted to keep in, and also that the film was made before special features existed, so the extra footage just doesn't exist anymore. It's a tragedy, because a director's cut of this is screaming to be released. Sadly, it will never happen.

This film is ultimately an attempt at a new approach toward sci-fi horror, by making the primary enemy the ship, the Event Horizon, itself, the antagonist, instead of some space monster. The Event Horizon never speaks; its only interest is in trapping Laurence Fishburne and his crew on the ship, and then returning back to Hell (literally) from whence it came. This results in an almost Paranormal Activity-style horror-fest, loaded with sequences in which people on the ship hallucinate or relive their own traumatic personal experiences. For all intents and purposes, this is a psychological thriller, as almost nothing that happens on the Event Horizon is genuine, but is instead caused by the people onboard as a result of their actions, as a response to their terrifying hallucinations.

Laurence Fishburne as Captain Miller here is really a treat. Miller isn't your average main character by any means, and Fishburne goes the extra mile to really make him special. His portrayal of the trauma-plagued but determined Miller is exceptional. His crew rounds out the cast very nicely, with excellent performances by everyone involved. Smith, Cooper, Justin, Weir--everyone does a bang-up job in their respective roles, which are varied and entertaining to follow. Everyone seems to have a backstory that is warped and abused by the Event Horizon, and the results are harrowing. Even Sam Neill as Dr. Weir is a real treat, as Neill isn't exactly known for playing the bad guy in films; but, like Javier Bardem, somehow pulls it off miraculously as a genuinely malevolent being. The difference is that Neill doesn't start out as a bad guy at all and is just a member of the crew, but later becomes the equivalent of Satan Himself due to the Event Horizon's influence on him, causing his raw hatred and resentment to manifest into pure chaos, thus dropping all good he once had and turning him into pure evil. Neill pulls all this off with a rare finesse that keeps him from being a generic villain, but someone who is genuinely tortured and influenced to destroy his own moral code for his own desperate purposes.

Perhaps most noticeable about this film is its style and incredibly advanced CG work. Don't forget, this was a film made almost 13 freaking years ago, in 1999, before DVDs even existed and special effects were insanely expensive to create (one brief opening shot of the Lewis and Clark above Earth took nearly one-freaking-third of the entire film's budget, according to commentary, due to the unreal number of constraints and problems involved in creating it to look as it does--did I mention computer animation wasn't exactly Avatar-grade at the time?). The film has a very unique style all its own, beginning and ending in peculiar fashions that are highly uncommon ways to begin and end a film. It's a treat, for sure, and the high-octane twist ending is not something anyone could possibly see coming, and yet still makes perfect sense in the context of the film.

One last thing I'd like to mention is that what really drives this film isn't the horror or the special effects, but the interactions between the characters that ultimately leads to utter insanity, along with a heroic sacrifice near the end that one normally wouldn't expect. Every character is unique, almost all have entertaining backstories that are later turned against them (often causing their deaths while hallucinating, almost like a Freddy Krueger-style dream from which you don't wake), and the film is just constructed wonderfully, with ultra-rapid-fire pacing and an undeniable style all its own.

No one's ever made a film like Event Horizon. The complaints it's being given just are not fair, and it really is one of the most entertaining sci-fi horror films made science Alien. Very highly recommended, especially given the current going price. Unfortunately, it's extremely unlikely there will ever be another version, as a director's cut is impossible and nothing else can be done to add to the film. Regardless, this is a cult classic for a very good reason."
167,3.0,"I first saw this flick in the cinema with a couple of friends, and for the first hour or so we were riveted to our seats! There are some great freaky moments here, and we found ourselves glancing at one another, wide-eyed and muttering things like ""Man, this is intense"".

Unfortunately the film loses its way a bit for the last half hour. It seems to resort to drawing from Hellraiser for its inspiration, and this doesn't quite come off.

There are great visuals in this flick. They are the real stars, and to watch this one alone is a cool idea, if you're into freaking yourself out!"
168,3.0,"After rewatching COBRA after an interval of many years, I didn't know whether to rate it one star, because its so ridiculously, God-awfully silly, stupid and over-the-topor to rate it five stars for that exact same reason. So I compromised and gave it three.

Marion Cobra Cobretti would hate me for that. He doesnt like compromise.

In fact, Marion Cobra Cobretti doesnt like much of anything, except chewing on matchsticks, driving his 50s muscle car, and mowing down criminals like a drunken redeck knocking tin cans off a fence with a machine gun. Who is Marion Cobra Cobretti, you ask? Well, if Clint Dirty Harry Eastwood and Charles Death Wish Bronson had a baby, and that baby was Godfathered by Arnold Commando Schwarzenegger, the answer would be Marion Cobra Cobretti, the head (and seemingly almost the only member of) The Zombie Squad, an LAPD detective unit called in when wishy-washy nonsense like Miranda and the Bill of Rights fail. And at the films opening, Cobra (Sylvester Stallone) is called in to deal with a psycho who has just shot up a grocery store at Christmas. This displeases Cobrettis immediate boss, wishy-washy Monty (Andrew Robinson), who knows where Cobretti goes, a litter of spent shell casings and bloody corpses will follow. But F Monty and those bleeding heart liberal reporters, because the truth is that crime is a disease, and Cobra is the cure  so he tells the psycho before first stabbing and then finally riddling him with bullets. Afterwards, the reporters ask if this killing had any connection to the Night Slasher case. Monty says no, which of course means that there IS a connection to whatever the hell the Night Slasher case may be, and that the Cobra will soon discover what it is.

(Behind those mirrored shades lies the investigative savvy of a Sherlock Holmes, believe me.)

But who is the Night Slasher, you ask? The Night Slasher (Brian Thompson) is the jut-jawed leader of a gang of homicidal maniacs who go out every night and viciously murder Angelinos with sharp or blunt instruments, evidently for the hell of it. He spews nonsense about creating a new world by slaughtering the weak but really, hes just evil scum  precisely the sort of scum Cobrettis .45 ACP slugs were made to splatter all over downtown Los Angeles. And when the Slashers gang drops the ball (or rather, the axe) by leaving a witness alive to one of its random slayings, the ball gets a-rollin. See, ole Slasher has what you might call an unforgettable face  it screams I AM THE NIGHT SLASHER, ASK ME ABOUT MY DISMEMBERMENT SPECIALS. So naturally he wants to locate this witness, a model named Ingrid (Bridgette Nielsen at her most horror-movie hapless) and hack her into chum before she can finger him. And Cobra, see, he doesnt want this, so you just know the two men  Slasher n Cobra  are gonna butt their sweaty, furrowed brows.

What follows is the sort of wanton mayhem only the 1980s, mingled with Stallone, could possibly produce. People get impaled. Vehicles get wrecked. Millions of bullets get expended. And Sly grates out stone-faced one-liners while setting people on fire. Seriously, the last twenty or so minutes of this film feature a freaking WW2 movie level of violence, with what seems like hordes of motorcycle-riding psychos testing out the dubious theory that leather biker jackets can stop submachinegun rounds, and Bridgette Nielsen reminding us why her career lasted about as long as a Viagra erection (four hours if you believe the commercials). But don't sweat it, folks, because what would traumatize you for life is just another day in the life of Marion Cobra Cobretti, a man so tough he slices his pizza with scissors!

COBRA is either a great awful movie or just a greatly awful one. Stallone, not exactly known for the subtlety of his worldview, is essentially remaking DIRTY HARRY here  even going so far as to cast two men who were in that film, Robinson and Reni Santoni  but the fact is, as iconic as Sly is, hes no Clint Eastwood, and no amount of burning gasoline, spent gunpowder and roasting human flush can mask the stench coming off the crappy acting, horrible writing and submoronic plot of this film. The difference between a hugely entertaining bad movie like COMMANDO and one which causes you to hold your head in your hands and make feeble groaning noises is subtle, but its there, and COBRA too-often strays into the latter category, probably because Sly, unlike Arnold, did not know at this stage of his career the secret of how to make fun of himself and boast at the same time. But if you're in the right mood  bloodthirsty, silly, 80s-nostalgic  you will probably enjoy the antics of Marion Cobra Cobrettiat least until you can lay your hands on a copy of RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART TWO."
169,1.0,"I've had the misfortune of seeing this movie twice. The first time, I expected an intense psychological thriller that would bend my mind over and prison-rape it. Instead, I was subjected to an utterly pointless and disgusting two-hour-long bloodbath. Some years passed, and after considerable professional therapy, I was able to put this bad memory behind me. Then, a little while ago, the sci-fi channel ran this movie. Not having anything better to do, and wondering if this movie was really as bad as I remembered, I watched it again. I have the following things to say about it:
(1) The set designs are freaking AWESOME. The acting is dead-on. The special effects are gorgeous. There are some genuinely creepy scenes, too. Basically, everything about it rocks except the plot. If you're looking to see some beautiful environments littered with corpses and splashed with blood, then this is the movie for you.
(2) The plot is stupid. A ship accidentally goes to Hell, then returns to our universe with a little chunk of Hell still attached to it... somewhere... maybe in those tunnels that use circuitboards for wallpaper, or in a secret compartment under the captain's chair. Anyway, there's a little souvenir from Hell on the ship somewhere, and it basically causes the crew to have such horrible hallucinations that one by one they either commit suicide or tear their eyes out because dammit, they're tired of seeing dead people's guts all over the place! Of course, the guy who built the ship is secretly in love with it, despite the fact that it's trying its hardest to kill him, so he starts yammering on and on about how the ship wants him to be its new crew (even though this ship very clearly does not like having ANY crew). And so on and so on until everyone is dead.
You know, actually, this movie could be very entertaining. Just get a bunch of friends together on the couch, split a six-pack or two, and MST the hell out of it, pun intended."
170,5.0,"Well, this review is long overdue, as many folks have asked me to follow up after my review of the ""Original Christmas Classics"" set, so here goes. First up though, I want to say that this ""Classic Christmas Favorites"" set from Warner Home Video (2008) IS supposed to have the classic stop-motion version of ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"", and NOT the live-action remake starring John Goodman. Apparently, since a lot of folks have complained about this, it seems many people have gotten this set with the wrong version. Amazing, since the original is clearly featured on the packaging. All I can do is speculate here that Warner had tons of those live-action DVDs lying around and were trying to get rid of them, ha, but maybe it was just an innocent but careless mistake. Regardless, as another reviewer has suggested, you can simply call Warner Customer Support, and they'll send you the correct DVD, and if you're lucky, they won't even ask you to send the other one back (which means you get a freebie, which is pretty sweet). I don't want to steal that other reviewer's thunder since they originally posted about this, so simply locate their review for the phone number.

Now, if you were lucky and got the RIGHT ""Year Without a Santa Claus"" disc, you SHOULD be very happy, as this is an excellent set loaded with classic holiday specials, and even some extras!

Disc 1 features one of the all-time greatest animated programs, the 1966 holiday classic ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"". This Chuck Jones directed masterpiece, overseen by Dr. Seuss himself, with the voices of Boris Karloff, June Foray, and Thurl Ravenscroft, is a Christmas MUST. Now, I actually like the Jim Carrey version, but it is no substitute for the original. If you are shockingly unfamiliar with it, this is the story of a grouchy, green creature who hates Christmas and decides to dress up as Santa Claus and ""steal"" it, essentially coming down chimneys and taking everyone's trees, presents, food, and decorations to dump off a mountaintop out of pure spite. That is, until he discovers there is more to Christmas than gifts, noise, and gluttony. A true worldwide favorite, and this version shouldn't be too scary for kiddies, ha.

Also on Disc 1 are, count 'em, three other Christmas specials, plus the bulk of the set's bonus features (since most are about the Grinch). The other three specials are all from those holiday maestros, Rankin and Bass, the guys who brought us the original Rudolph and Frosty TV classics (found in the ""Original Christmas Classics"" set). Here, we have ""The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold"", ""Pinocchio's Christmas"", and ""The Stingiest Man In Town"". These three are all entertaining, but a bit more forgettable (story-wise, at least) as Rankin/Bass holiday specials go. ""The Leprechaun's Christmas Gold"" (1981, stop-motion ""animagic"") isn't that much about Christmas and could easily have been written as a Saint Patrick's Day special. Perhaps that was the original idea, and they just fell under network or reputation pressure to work-in the Christmas aspect. I don't know, but basically it's a fun little story about leprechauns and a young sailor trying to prevent a banshee from stealing taking their Christmas gold. Some folks have complained that its a story that doesn't have the Christmas spirit, as the banshee requires the gold to stay alive and the leprechauns are just being greedy by not giving it to her, and I can see the point of such complaints, but if you are able to look past that and just enjoy the rarity of a leprechaun story, it's entertaining enough. ""Pinocchio's Christmas"" (1980, stop-motion ""animagic"") is similar to Leprechauns in that it could have just been a Pinocchio story, but they worked Christmas into it. The special is basically a series of Pinocchio-type adventures started by Pinocchio wanting to buy Geppetto a Christmas gift. Like in the original Pinocchio story, he is tricked repeatedly by the Fox and Cat, ends up in the hands of a mean puppeteer, etc... If you like Pinocchio stories, you'll like this one. And finally, ""The Stingiest Man In Town"" (1978) is Rankin Bass's rather straightforward, traditionally animated version of ""A Christmas Carol"", AKA ""Scrooge"". As I understand it, it's a remake of a live-action musical version from 1956, but this special is told by a B.A.H. Humbug, a literal bug (voiced by Tom Bosley), which I doubt was the case in the live-action Basil Rathbone version. The wonderful extras on Disc 1 are, as I mentioned, all Grinch-related. There's that wonderful ""Making-Of"" special that I remember seeing on TNT, hosted by the always hilarious Phil Hartman, whom we all greatly miss. There's also a featurette on the music of the Grinch (Songs in the Key of Grinch), a nice Seuss featurette (Dr. Seuss and the Grinch - From Whoville to Hollywood), text bios, an actual commentary track with voice actress Jun Foray (Cindy Lou Who) and Animator Phil Roman, and what are described as pencil tests but simply appear to be three production art drawings from the special.

Disc 2 is the much talked about ""Year Without a Santa Claus"" disc so many people have been getting the wrong version of. If your set holds the correct version, the featured special will be the old ""animagic"" (stop-motion) version from Rankin/Bass, 1974. This program is one of the big Rankin/Bass holiday classics to most people, most famous for the Heat Miser/Snow Miser musical number. Personally, for some reason, this one never was a tradition for me, as I just don't remember it being aired yearly as a kid. When I was an older kid, it would get multiple airings, but I never caught it. I guess I never really sat and watched it until I got this set. It's a cute and original little story, but for me it's no Rudolph, Frosty, or Santa Claus is Coming to Town. I can see myself possibly forming a new attachment to it though, but I digress. ""Year Without a Santa Claus"" is about Santa catching a cold and not wanting to go out on his yearly rounds one Christmas, long ago. The real problem, though, seems to be that Santa has gotten the impression that people no longer really care if he visits or not. Mrs. Claus considers making the rounds herself, but instead sends two elves on a mission to find proof that people still believe in Santa and care about him coming on Christmas Eve. This leads to other complications in which Mrs. Claus must try to make a deal with the Miser Brothers to allow it to snow in a place called Southtown to restore the belief in Santa Claus there. Lots of great music and fun in this classic special, to be sure. And that's not all of the great stuff on Disc 2. There are two more specials AND some bonus features!

The other two specials on Disc 2 are ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"" and ""Nestor, The Long-Eared Christmas Donkey"", both in the ""animagic"" medium. The first is, for me at least, a true classic. I loved this one AT LEAST as much as the original Rudolph. Clearly, he was Rankin/Bass's little star/hero, and in this unforgettable New Year's special from 1976, Rudolph is sent on a mission to find the missing Baby New Year, Happy. Rudolph must find little Happy in time for the new year, but also before the monster-bird Eon the Terrible finds him first! Yeah, Eon was actually pretty scary when I was a little kid! This one is full of neat characters and fun adventure as Rudolph and new friends that he meets along the way search over a cluster of magical islands that represent past years. This is the special that introduces the whale, Big Ben, with the big clock in his tail, and the camel, The Great Quarter Past Five, with the big clock for a hump, ha, along with the caveman, One Million, the Knight, Sir Ten-To-Three, Seventeen Seventy Six, Father Time, and even the three bears! Father Time is the storyteller, as Rankin/Bass always seems to have one of those, and is voiced by Red Skelton (looks like him too). As for ""Nestor, The Long-Eared Donkey"" (1977), you may not have heard of this one before, or you may easily confuse it with other specials, but Nestor (narrated by Roger Miller, playing a donkey descendant of Nestor) is the story of a little donkey with ridiculously long ears. Need I say more? Yes, it's like Rudolph or Dumbo, a character made fun of for a physical oddity that pays off in the end. It's not the best or most original special, but some may appreciate this one at least for its focus on the Nativity Story, as Nestor ends up being the donkey that carries Mary to Bethlehem. You may take issue with that if you are a big ""Small One"" fan, like myself, but, oh, well. Nestor is a cute little critter too, so there's that as well, and we get to see Santa and co. gathered around a manger display in the end, which is lovely if you'd like to see Santa acknowledging the true meaning of Christmas in a special for a change of pace. On to the bonus features of Disc 2 though. There are two featurettes, both of which are pretty nice. One is ""We Are Santa's Elves"", which is about Rankin/Bass (with emphasis on Year Without a Santa Claus, I'd say), and the other is ""Stop Motion 101"", which is all about the process of Stop Motion Animation. Good stuff!

Disc Three holds two more great holiday specials. In fact, these are two favorites of mine in particular. Both are traditionally animated and from Rankin/Bass. I generally prefer their animagic stuff, but these and the original Frosty are the ones I make the exception for. They are simply delightful. First up is the TRUE Frosty sequel, 1976's ""Frosty's Winter Wonderland"", narrated by an animated Andy Griffith. In the story, Frosty comes back to town to have fun with the kids again (sadly, a favorite character of mine, little Karen, is not part of this story, though I've heard she can be seen in one scene and I need to check on that). However, the children notice that when they have to go in for the night, Frosty gets lonely (well, he basically tells them). So, they end up building him a wife. I always say this, but why he decides on a frozen Shelly Winters is beyond me. I'd make a snow-Elisabeth Harnois or a snow-Hilary Duff, or something more along those lines. Call me superficial (but call me). Anyway, things work out until Jack Frost gets jealous of Frosty's popularity. It's a wonderful and original little sequel from R/B, with a simple and charming story and reasonably good continuity with the first (returning voices and close-enough art, etc...), unlike the two most recent attempts at 2D Frosty sequels (Frosty Returns and The Legend of Frosty the Snowman). Unfortunately, don't expect to ever find this one coupled with the original special, since, as I understand it, WB's ownership of Rankin/Bass titles only includes the 1974-1989 titles (minus ""The Last Unicorn""). So, I just recommend getting this boxed set and the ""Original Christmas Classics"" set, as I did. Continuing, the second special on Disc Three is 1974's ""'Twas the Night Before Christmas"", and it's the tale of a town with a problem. A ""forward-thinking"" young mouse scripts an anonymous letter that gets printed in the newspaper and simply explains that Santa Claus does not exist. This, of course, offends Santa and the townspeople become concerned that he will not visit them this year. A musical town clock is commissioned to be built that will sing praises of Santa when it chimes, but the little mouse (who lives in the clock maker's own home) mucks that up as well. It's a great story of making mistakes, learning from them, and working hard to put them right, and just a delightful little Christmas story that ends with the telling of the classic poem of the same name. Both of these fine specials are a must for any Christmas Special-lover's collection.

Finally, we come to Disc 4, which holds the feature film (yes, theatrically released), ""Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July"". It's from 1979, and the great part is that it brings Rudolph and Frosty together, explained here as best-friends, with their original voices and with Frosty's wife Crystal too (voiced again by Shelly Winters). Mickey Rooney returns as Santa (whom he played in ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" and ""Year Without a Santa Claus""), and we get to see Frosty's kids as well! Plus, Jack Frost and Big Ben make an appearance! So, it's like a great crossover flick for hardcore Rankin/Bass fans! This was one of two attempts Rankin/Bass made at doing animagic feature films, the other being ""Mad Monster Party"", which I recommend for a Halloween R/B fix. The negative on this one is that, well, Christmas in July itself is kind of a bunk concept. Do you watch this at Christmas, or in July? I think I vote Christmas though. The story is pretty interesting though, and it provides a detailed backstory on Rudolph's special light. The villain is a warlock named Winterbolt, who returns to take back control of the North, but first he must defeat its new ruler, Santa Claus. He decides to do this with a storm, but feels he first must get Rudolph and his light-up nose out of the way. When he learns that Rudolph will lose his glow if he ever uses it for an act of evil, he arranges some trickery to cause Rudolph to help in a robbery without knowing it. He also manipulates Frosty and family in his further scheming to gain power. This all happens at the worst time for the Frosties, as they, along with Rudolph, are out of their cold-weather element (thanks to magic amulets) helping a circus put on a Christmas in July themed show. Red Buttons and Ethel Merman also star. Some have called this film's story a bit bleak since the major characters come into some pretty dark situations, sometimes facing ""death"" (as in, melting or losing your magic hat, in some cases), but I think freaking out about those plot elements is a bit much. Having said that, though, perhaps overall the story is darker than one might expect. The heightened drama was probably because the film was made for theatrical release. Overall, it's a good if not great story, and the big highlight is seeing the Frosties in animagic form and seeing all the characters I mentioned together in one story. For that, it's another Rankin/Bass fan Must-Own.

So, that's the ""Classic Christmas Favorites"" DVD set in a nutshell. It's a very solid collection of holiday greats I highly recommend. Get the ""Original Christmas Classics"" set first, but definitely follow-up with this one (or get them at the same time, duh). It's terrible about the swapped disc issue for Year Without a Santa Claus, but just make sure to call Warner Customer Support if your set holds the live-action version instead. They should set you up with the right one, and then you'll be thrilled with this wonderful collection."
171,3.0,"I'd just like to mention that the guy who put down ""The Best of Jeff Hardy"" left out some very important matches...

Jeff Hardy vs. The Undertaker for the WWE Undisputed Championship was freaking awesome and is considered one of RAW's greatest matches of all time!

TLC 2002 was considered RAW's ""GREATEST"" match of all time, need I say more?"
172,1.0,"I had heard alot of people saying that Alien Ressurection brought new life to the series was up there with Alien and Aliens.  Neadless to say I got a nasty suprise.  Alien 3 had it's problems but it's a freaking masterpiece  compared to this film.
While the idea of Ripley being resurected isn't  bad the cast is just terrible.  Even Sigourney Weaver and Winona Ryder do  lousy jobs.
The story gets pretty stupid also.  Once again the Aliens  manage to break free after they get one out of Ripley's clone.  However,  this time it doesn't take a while and build up a gradual suspense like the  first 3 films.  This time they seem to break out right after they get them.  Later you discover that the scientists are trying to mix humans and aliens  together into a new species.  It's never really explaned why they are doing  this; the audience is expect just to sit back and say ""well I guesse  the scientists don't have anything better to do.  There are a few  interesting action sequences but most are forgetable and the film just  isn't scary.
Alien 3's problem was a bad script.  Alien Resurection's  problem is that it is simply a bad movie."
173,1.0,"I tried watching this movie because everybody says that it is one of the greatest movies of all time, it's been on all the lists, and people say it was really groundbreaking for it's time and all that. God dammit was this one of the worst movies I ever sat through. It was soooo freaking boring. I can't believe this was only an hour and a half, it seems so long, it just drags on and on, the story is completely uninteresting, the characters are boring and unlikable (I mean really, am I supposed to find Woody Allen charming? And I never got why people treated Diane Keaton like a fashion icon) , and there is hardly any humor to be found. It was just an hour and a half of people bitching at each other. I guess for it's time it was a breakthrough, and (SPOILERS)I do like that they didn't get back together in the end, but honestly, their relationship didn't make any sense from the get-go, I mean they had absolutely zero chemistry. Now, I'll admit that this is way before my generation but I like older movies, and I would expect myself to like this sort of movie (a romantic comedy that isn't brainless and formulaic). I'm really just excited to see many other negative reviews of this movie, I now feel a little less alone in this world."
174,5.0,"But we fans of ""Evil Dead"" certainly don't care.  It's not his singing skills we're interested in.  What we want to know is this; can the man still decapitate with the swing of a shovel?  Well, of course he can!  As long as you own this or ""Evil Dead II"" you'll get to watch him do it over and over as often as you want.  For me, this is the scene that defines what ""Evil Dead"" is all about in a nutshell:
-Creative camera work.
-Spirited if not talented actors.
-Audacious, imaginative gore.
-Spook-house fun.
With one swing of a shovel, Ashley (Ash/Bruce Campbell) defines the mood of this film.  But maybe I should start at the beginning and slice this film up into little pieces.  Only then will I truly bring honor to Sam Raimi's seminal film of the horror genre.

-5 WHEELS HEAD FOR THE RICKETY OLD CABIN.
This film moves at a blindingly fast pace.  If you ever get bored watching ""Evil Dead"" regardless of what you think of it, then I don't want to be you.  About 3 minutes into the film, we get POV (point of view) shots through the woods watching our 2 couples, Ash and Linda (Bruce and Betsy Baker), Scott and Shelly (Richard DeManincor and Theresa Tilly) along with Ash's sister, Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss); the fifth wheel I eluded to, driving up to the isolated and run down cabin.  It doesn't take long for all hell to break loose after a recording found in the cellar is played with magic words in it.  The words in German are: ""Sam and Rob, Das ist Hikers Dan dee Roadsa"" translated to mean ""Sam and Rob are the Hikers on the road"".  Of course, this references Raimi and executive producer Robert Tapert who were portraying local yokels on the road leading to the cabin.  Regardless of Raimi's goofy devices, fifth wheels are usually where all the trouble begins and those magic words aren't ones to ignore the rules.  This thinnest of plots becomes one of the great scaffolds of horror ever put to film.

-WHEN SETTING THE STANDARD IS NO STANDARD AT ALL.
If there was a gorier, sloppier more audaciously violent film prior to ""Evil Dead"" I want to know what it is (because I want it!).  I believe this film set the standards for eliminating standards in a horror movie.  Even by today's ""standards"", ""Evil Dead"" can still hold its own for balls-out gore and grossness while still being a load of fun.  Though the demonic makeup is a bit goofy by today's measurements, I still admire the vision of the work.  At the very worst you see seams, wrinkles and flaws.  At the very best, it is still very creepy and grotesque.  The only standard this film didn't stretch was in the nudity department (as there really isn't any).  However, when getting raped by a tree is ok, well... ...enough said.

-SCARY?  OH YEA!
As horror films age, they tend to lose their visceral impact.  Even horror classics fail to scare people most of the time with few exceptions.  After nearly 30 years this film still holds up very well to its modern rivals.  Though more over-the-top than anything that preceded, ""Evil Dead"" could still disturb the uninitiated.  For me, few things are scarier than demonic possession.  A demon is invisible, moves indiscriminately, is deceptive by nature and is in a hurry to get your soul.  So, anyway it can get you dead is fair game.  This movie plays on all those angles to the hilt.  The big surprise with ""Evil Dead"" was the physical state possession left people in.  This took ""The Exorcist"" to a different level.  The funny and great thing is most of the actors are better at being possessed than human.  Of course, Raimi's POV camera shots might be the scariest innovation employed in this film.  Regardless, it all adds up to a nearly timeless horror experience.

-HI I'M BRUCE CAMPBELL.  YOU MIGHT REMEMBER ME FROM ""DOG SOLDIERS"".
Yea, I'm kidding.  That was a characters name in ""Dog Soldiers""; clearly a case of a director paying his respects to a horror icon.  Needless to say, Bruce is the undisputed king of camp and B-movie horror.  He's even had his ""A-movie"" cameos (Spider Man films etc.).  But this is where it all started for him.  In retrospect, he was an awful actor in ""Evil Dead"", yet he brought a sense of slapstick to horror that was both fun and refreshing.  He'll never win an Oscar (for what it's worth) but he has had a long and storied career since his initial portrayal of Ash.  Amazingly, the other actors in ""Evil Dead"" may have actually done a better job than Bruce, but they lacked his persona.  They have all become legendary for this film but have never translated that into successful film careers for a bunch of different reasons.  To learn more about this, particularly the women, a little book is included with this version of ""Evil Dead"" titled ""The Ladies of the Evil Dead"".  Boy, that's clever marketing,

-WHICH VERSION IS THE BEST?
I have no freaking clue!  The ""Evil Dead"" series may be the most reproduced and exploited horror series ever.  If you can find a series of titles more reproduced in more varied levels of quality (excluding Star Wars), then I'd like to know what it is.  Given this, I don't know if one version is more complete than another.  I have the one with the green outlined letters with Bruce Campbell's kisser poking through and the girl reaching up.  This version has the little book in it.  It's good enough for me.

-PUTTING MY SOUL ON THE LINE
As low as the budget is, as clunky as the acting gets, as thin as the plot is, ""Evil Dead"" is a landmark horror movie.  Horror films that came before could be viewed as sluggish.  Much of what came after could be viewed as derivative.  Regardless of these iconic traits, ""Evil Dead"" is just flat out entertaining.  Who cares where it came from or where it's going.  Forget my fan-boy rambling and just sit down on Halloween night and watch ""Evil Dead"", ""Evil Dead II"", and ""Army of Darkness"".  If you enjoy audacious, in-your-face, balls-out horror done on the cheap, then this will do it for you.

175,5.0,"I own this movie and I watch it quite often and you should own it to. Why?Its great! If you love horror you will love this. Not only the first in the Evil Dead series but the best. It did not have the comic trappings of the others. It did have a little humour but it was in many ways really good scares and gore done in a very creative way all on a very low budget. Its amazing they made something this good so cheap. Okay we all know Bruce Campbell(Ash)goes to stay at some cabin in the woods with some friends,his girlfriend,and his sister. They find the Necronomicon(for all you Lovecraft fans.)they then read from it which we all know is not the best ideal. Soon things are happening,scary and threatening things. The thing that makes it scary is that the woods in and of themselves are truly the land of the wild and are living with evil. One of the girls goes for a walk and some trees rape her. Okay that sounds terrible and shocking but its done pretty tastefully,well as tasteful as you can make a tree raping someone scene. It was definitely original. Soon everyone is freaking out and scared. Two of the girls are sitting down trying to see if they have any psychic abillities by guessing what card the other is holding up. A third girl is staring out the window. Soon she begins naming all the cards being held up at a fast rate,something is definitely not right going on here! Then her voice changes she turns around,her eyes are rolled back hands in claws,fangs! It is a truly scary moment the first time you watch it. Yes she is possessed by one of the elder beings from beyond time. I cant give alot away and ruin it for all of you who have never seen this but suffice to say never a dull moment from here lots of gore and lots of unique and unheard of stuff done with that gore. Yes I love Evil Dead and if you appreciate good horror you will to."
176,5.0,"I've read a lot of reviews on this seires and have seen a mixed bag. My stand is that Iria was a great seires and here's why.
First of all the animation was great, and the series was only six episodes long, so it can be watched in one evening.  Zeiram, the villan, was tough and practically unstopable, which is how a good anime villan should be.
The background music compliments the series well and at times gets stuck in your head throughout the day.  The series is light enough, in language that preteens could watch it w/o their perents freaking out.
The plot moves along at a quick pace and the action keeps you into the series.
To be fair, I will say that the dialouge dubbing could have been better, but after awhile you get used to the chopping converstaions.
Lets put it this way, Iria was meant to be an action stroy, not a character developing anime.  If you want character development, you may not like Iria, but if you want an action thrill ride with a lets shoot first and ask questions later attitude, then Iria should be to your liking."
177,2.0,Avocados??? This movie is about freaking avacados??? The acting in this movie wasn't too bad but the story was really lame. A group of feminists hide in the middle of an avacado plantation and kill any man (AND eats him) that tries to come in and pick the avacados. Watch at your own risk.
178,3.0,"Thirty Five years ago, in the age of Superfriends and Johnny Quest, there was a small TV station in Atlanta called channel 17, which was owned by a guy named Ted Turner.  Day after day my friends and I would watch this station after school and on Saturday mornings, receiving a daily fix of entertainment gems like Clutch Cargo and the Banana Splits.  It was also here that I received my first taste of Japanese culture, in the form of Speed Racer and Ultraman.

If you are the parent of a small child, whatever you do, don't expose your children to this or any show originating in Japan.  Seriously.  It will screw your child's head up, just as it did mine.  Some people may think that a show featuring a bunch of guys in cheap latex suits smashing cardboard buildings and toy planes in just harmless entertainment.  Think again.  The truth is obvious.  The Japanese, still smarting over their defeat at the hands of the allies, sought and found an insidious way to get even.  By striking at the youngest and most vunerable of us; namely our children.  You may think I'm joking here, but seriously, I'm not. This show, and other shows from Japan like Pokemon or Power Rangers, will warp your child's brain.

Ultraman is a space opera set in a dystopian near future, a nightmare world where a virtually helpless civilian population lives in a state of constant fear, as rampaging monsters, over 50 foot high, regularly appear to reek havoc on major cities.  The only thing standing between civilization and a complete social breakdown is an elite fighting force known as The Science Patrol (which sounds a lot cooler if spoken in the original Japanese).  They have at their disposal an arsenal of the most sophisticated weapons known to man.  In fact, they've allocated so much towards their miltary budget that they literally didn't have enough funds left to purchase a decent automobile.  What's most disturbing is the fact that in the near future, Japan has become fully remilitarized.

The Science Patrol's cast of main characters has been imitated in numerous ensemble action films and TV series, most recently ""Armegeddon"" and ""Team America"".  There's the elderly leader (who frequently takes orders from Hiyata rather than gives them...strange), two slightly goofy members who provide comic relief from time to time,  the hot female member named Fuji, and Hiyata, the lead charcter who is the Clark Kent of the show.

Each episode follows a basic formula.  A monster appears, the Science Patrol promptly picks a fight with it, gets in over their heads, and then Ultraman shows up to bail them out.  While this may seem like an innocent premise, there are some very dark and disturbing underlying messages.  What parents may find troubling is the xenophobia that still permeated Japanese culture at the time that this show was made.  Some of these monsters are clearly sentient beings, yet the Science Patrol rarely  makes any attempt to resolve their conflicts diplomatically.  Like the Japanese of the pre-colonial era,  outsiders are usually considered an enemy who must be dealt with in a violent fashion.  And like the Japanese military during the second World War, the Science Patrol typically find themselves in over their heads and unable to finish the fight that they started.

Ultraman himself is an obvious metaphore for the Japanese army.  Although he comes out swinging, he's unable to stick in the fight for the long haul.  If he does not defeat his enemy quickly, his warning light begins to blink.  If it stops, he dies.  I won't use this forum to debate the logic of having a warning light on your chest that tells your enemies that you are getting tired.  The light itself obviously represents the Japanese rising sun.

The most insidious thing about this show is that it encourages young people not to utilize their critical thinking skills.  In most forms of narrative fiction, be it print or film, the plot details are slowly revealed through the actions and the dialogue.  Here, a narrarator clearly explains everything to the viewer.  This is clearly a Japanese plot to make our young people stupid, and we are only now starting to see the bitter fruit that this has produced.  Just look at our elections of 2000 and 2004.  No doubt many of these voters grew up watching Ultraman and Speed Racer.  With the advent of Power Rangers and Pokemon, we have probably lost another generation as well.

But now that I'm old enough to handle it, I can view Ultraman with a fresh perspective.  So, what do I think of goofy mosters smashing cardboard buildings an model airplanes?  I freaking love it!  I must admit.  I LOVE IT!  Now that I have the collection on DVD, and will gladly embrace the horror time after time after time.

For those out there with short attention spans:  if you don't want to sit through the entire episode and just want to see ""the good parts"", Ultraman does not actually appear in any episode until the clock is between 21:00 and 22:00, without exception.

Episodes of note:

Episode 1: Not very good.  ""I am Ultraman"" is cheesy even by this show's standards.  But it is the debut.

Episode 2: Not nearly as good as Episode 16, but it is the debut of the crab people.

Episode 4: This one really freaked me out when I was 5.  The monster looking in the window.  It stuck with me.

Episode 5: Plant Monster smashes church.  Blasphemous.

Episode 8: Ultraman visits Monster Island.  Way cool!

Episode 10: Ultraman vs. Godzilla. 'nuff said.

Episode 16:  The Crab People are Back!!!  One of the absolute best!  Debut of the lazor saw.

Episode 20:  Wow!!!  Aeial dogfights!  Some of the absolute best action of the entire collection.  Ultraman amost gets his a** kicked.  A very good episode.

Disapointment:  this collection did not feature the moster who looked just like R. Shulman, from elementary school.  You know who you are, dude.  The moster with big broad shoulders looks just like you.  I was disappointed that this episode wasn't on this collection.  I was looking foward to laughing at you.

Special Effects:  I love them.  If you judge them against today's standards, you're totally missing the point.  The filmakers obviously loved what they were doing and took their craft very seriously, and it comes through.  And they do get better as the series progresses.

About the DVD transfers:  all the negative comments about the DVD quality is justified.  I don't really care that much, though.  Its not ""Lord of the Rings"", after all.  All the restoration in the world isn't going to change the fact that this is a forty year old TV show with really bad (and by bad I mean ""AWESOME"") special effects."
179,5.0,"What a great freaking deal for these movies, $29.99, REALLY?! I paid a little bit more for my set a couple of months ago here on Amazon and I wish that I had waited to save a few bucks, but still, what I paid was absolutely worth it. These Blu-rays look awesome and the movies are all great, so, no complaints here.

Everything arrived in excellent shape and the movie's picture and sound quality are BEAUTIFUL...plus, lots of great documentaries and behind the scenes info and other added features make this 5-movie set a MUST HAVE. I highly recommend it for sci-fi fans like me."
180,4.0,"Is pretty neat to find an old time favorite cult film entertaning after almost ten years without watching it. The first time I saw this flick, I thought it was one of the scariest thing I've ever seen. Then years later, it feels really good to have the same effect, even though it wasn't what I expect it. The first 30 minutes still very frightening and tense, but the rest of the flick wasn't just how I remenbered it...it gets a bit slow, but pretty good any how...this is a very low budget flick with a huge potential of freaking people out...give it a try...you won't regret it."
181,4.0,I think I recall hearing about it at some point but never saw it. Very clever and provocative about the extent the TV networks will go to see advertising. I loved the scene where Truman is freaking out and the actress pretending ot be Trumans wife turns to the camera and does a commercial... to much. Jim Carrey as usual (you will recognize some of his trademark expressions) is great and well suited to playing Truman.
182,5.0,"I freaking love this movie. I saw it with my girlfriend and surprisingly she felt the same way. The story was good and the death scenes. BTW there is one death scene that was retarded, you'll know what I'm talking about if you watch the movie. The acting was horrible too, but if you can let that go and take this as a b rated horror flick from the 80's then its a must have."
183,4.0,"If you like campy horror flicks or ""Horror comedy"", then Basket Case is right up your ally. Basket case is a film about a young man who moves into a shady apartment in New York. People who meet him find him a little odd because he is always carrying a basket with him. It is later reveled that what he is carryig is his grotesquely deformed siamese twin. When I say deformed, I mean it. It gave me the freaking creeps.(It makes terrible noises when it's mad)Well, the young man soon starts to see a cute desk girl who he meets at his doctors office. The two start to date but it turns out the his brother in the basket has some murderous ""Seperation"" issues. The production is B grade. The acting is so corny its hilarious but ""Basket Case"" still delivers enough scares to keep you interested. The beauty of the film is that it knows it's corny but it makes it's corniness one of it's strengths. If you're a fan of B horror or just horror in general ""Basket Case"" is a must see."
184,4.0,"This movie is freaking hilarious.  I'm suddenly a Jeff Bridges fan.  Plus, one scene takes place in Simi Valley, California, where I was born and raised.  How cool is that?  Did I mention that Jeff Bridges rocks in this movie?  I think I did, but whatever.  You mind if I burn a J?"
185,1.0,"My mother and I have a certain few chick flicks that, no matter what, whenever on is on TV we will stop and watch it.  The American President was one of them.  I must have seen it twenty times.  We loved it, and I considered it a truly great movie.

... then I grew up.  We watched it in my government class because our teacher was sick, and I noticed with horror... that this guy, the man we're supposed to be rooting for, is a Democrat!  He defends ACLU, he is for ""gun control,"" he cavorts around with environmental lobbyists!  How can I root for someone who stands against all of my core beliefs?  Then, not only that, the guy who shares MY beliefs, the Republican, is totally demonized.  He is old and stodgy and Michael Douglas constantly makes fun of him.  Which, I guess looking back, is the good ol' liberal way of handling people who know what they're talking about.

And THEN there's the romance.  Now, okay, widower President dating is one thing.  But President putting off going to stop an airline strike to go buy flowers for his girlfriend?  President not doing ANYTHING to assure the public that their relationship would not affect anything he did?  President NEVER giving ANY addresses whatsoever, not even when freaking bombing Libya?  And not only this, but the girl he is seeing is a LOBBYIST (environmental too, BLECH).  Whenever his cabinet members were discussing important matters, all he would ask is things like ""Do you think she likes me?""  He was more concerned with this hot redhead than matters of state.  Mr. President, what you do behind closed doors is your own business, but when you let it get you distracted when you are the leader of our FREAKING COUNTRY it gets a little out of hand.  Oh, and this girl burned the flag once.  Y'know, the American flag.  And Mr. Democrat President DEFENDS her.  We're supposed to sympathize with them.  I can't.  I tried, but I can't.  We're supposed to be like ""OMG THOSE EVIL REPUBLICANS!  Yeah, why AREN'T you a member of the ACLU?  And why WON'T you support this ban on fossil fuels?  And WHY are you arming our druglords with your evil second amendment!  FOR SHAME!""  I don't know about you guys, but I just.. can't.

I'll miss this movie, I really will.  But maybe they should have tried less to force leftist ideals down my throat, and tried harder to win me over to the love story.  And maybe made the President seem a little more than a lovesick teenager.  Like when he asks his Sec of State who talked with Sydney on the phone: ""Did she say anything about me?""  And, exasperated, he says ""No, but I'll ask her before study hall!""  That sums up my feelings pretty well.

Good thing we didn't get to the ending where I'd have to hear his little self-righteous speech.  I probably would have thrown up."
186,4.0,"This movie is freaking hilarious.  I'm suddenly a Jeff Bridges fan.  Plus, one scene takes place in Simi Valley, California, where I was born and raised.  How cool is that?  Did I mention that Jeff Bridges rocks in this movie?  I think I did, but whatever.  You mind if I burn a J?"
187,4.0,"Asia Argento is a cop on the trail of a rapist/serial killer who she follows from Rome to Florence.  Once in Florence she falls victim to the Stendhal Syndrome, a supposedly real psychological condition(it's described in detail on the second disc) that causes people to feel ill, become disoriented, hallucinate, faint or lose touch with reality when exposed to certain pieces of artwork or architecture.  While this condition may indeed exist, I doubt anybody experiences it to quite the degree Asia does in this film, as she is able to literally(in her mind) step into a painting and immerse herself in the environment the painting depicts.  These scenes showcase Dario's flair for visuals.  So, it's bad enough that she's got this Stendhal stuff to deal with, but at the same time, the killer has targeted her.  Like the killer in Argento's Opera, he becomes smitten with Asia, and isn't so much interested in killing her as he is taking her for his own perversions whenever he feels like it.  This sets off a series of events that leads Asia through a nightmarish adventure.  To give away more of the plot is to give away some of the twists.  This movie is kinda split amongst the Argento fanbase, with some on one side saying he'd lost his way and others saying it's one of the most underrated and misunderstood movies of his career.  Of course you'll have to see it for yourself to be the judge of where you stand.  Personally, I found it very enjoyable and disturbing.  Only two things really bugged me about it and they're not too big.  First off, the movie does drag a bit near the halfway mark more than it should.  Second, it's hard to build alot of sympathy for Asia's character because she's such an emotional basket case from the very beginning.  The whole film has her going through many psychological changes, freaking out, crying and doing irrational stuff at any given moment.  I realize that this is all part of the overall point, but we never see her ""normal"" to begin with, so it's kinda hard to identify with her on any level at all.  That's not to say Asia's performance is bad coz she actually plays it quite well(of course she's pretty much made a career out of playing women with psychological baggage of varying degrees).  Very well, actually.  A very interesting film any way you cut it, and a must for Argento fans.  This dvd from Blue Underground looks wonderful compared to that cruddy Troma disc we've had to suffer through for the last few years.  Disc 2 consists of various individual interviews totaling a little over an hour and a half with Dario and other crew members.  One interview is with the psychologist who Dario consulted about the Stendhal Syndrome.  This is the doctor who apparently is the world's authority on the syndrome and treats many patients at a hospital in Florence.  She also wrote the book on the subject.  This is an interesting little feature.  Supposedly 80% of the population suffers from this syndrome to some degree.  BS or not?  You decide.  Good movie though."
188,4.0,I remember freaking out the first time I watched this flick back when I was a kid...
189,5.0,"It's a freaking classic. What more can I say? Great Date Night flick, right? Highly recommended if you want those crucial brownie points. Put it on the schedule."
190,2.0,"I'm a Woody Allen fan. Yeah, I like his neurotic genius, how he writes such intellectual dialogue between real people.
But this movie was so  freaking dull. Geez. And to be in black and white too. That makes it even  duller. I was really disappointed. The story needed to be a little more  compelling. Nothing interesting seemed to happen."
191,4.0,"watched this little bargain basement horror parade many years ago while cleaning the house one very sunny afternoon. which is something I very seldom ever do. and haven't since then. that is, enjoy the bright sun while cleaning house, and especially, while watching a horror movie.

however, I recently gave it another shot late one night last week, and I must say, after a short time in, despite the gritty low-budget, and overacting to say the least, the madness becomes quite the charm.

if you like OLD-SCHOOL STYLE SLASHER FILMS, or, those grungy GRIND HOUSE/DRIVE-IN movies that, despite popular opinion, have their importance in cinema history, this basement is for you. especially if you are a fan of FRIDAY the 13th: a NEW BEGINNING. I kid you not. the movie follows that story (a bunch of quirky, colorful characters, in a half way house for the slightly insane, are knocked off, one by one, by a mysterious killer) Hell, there's even a token nice black guy, and an actress that jumps into her role with such bold zest that would give BETSY PALMER, Jason's mommy, a run for her money. this woman is a hoot! and really holds it all together. with an ending that is just as climatic as the original FRIDAY THE 13TH. with relish.

yes! there are many flaws. just as many broken plot points as the characters within. for instance, it's only a small, two story home, but yet the crazy hysterics, and gory violent murders, seem to each take place in their own universe, making it hard to map out, exactly, where, when, and how, it's all happening within in the asylum. What is clearly just poor scripting, and bad acting, comes off as rather bizarre, like a SLASHER FILM set in TWILIGHT ZONE. and the newly arrive nurse doesn't have the sense that God gave a Billy Goat, that something amiss is happening right around her. despite the fact that patients are jumping out of closets with large knives, freaking out about baby dolls, and watching her sleep while holding an axe.

It's a real Crack Parade! you're either able to pick up a pom pom, march along and get high, or, turn around and run for the hills. It's up to you if you wanna participate. And, it costs much less, but be warned, it could still be HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!"
192,3.0,"Entertaining film with a fair amount of cute, interesting observations about relationships, people and the nature of things in general. When a fellow theatergoer shushes Greg Kinnear's character, Kinnear says, ""A hot dog is singing. Do you need silence while a hot dog sings?"" Tom Hanks is his likable self, and Meg Ryan is the usual. I don't care for her and do not see why people are so stuck on her. She is cute, but she overacts in a way that just... bothers me. I think the concept of this picture arrives at a timely moment when many people are finding themselves meeting via computers and using technology to aid in their personal lives, which grow busier and busier as technology grows more pervasive. It also comes at a time in history when the concept of the bigger and cheaper chains overrunning the small, independent businesses is commonplace. Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, an independent bookstore owner who struggles when Hanks's big mega chain bookstore, Fox Books, opens around the corner from Kelly's store. (Ironically Kelly's railing against the homogenization of the world parallels the way movies of this nature are made. The industry is so obsessed with making a profit that they will reuse the same story over and over and the public is gullible to buy it over and over). In person, the pair have an adversarial relationship. Online, not knowing that they are speaking to each other... not really knowing who they are speaking with, they basically fall in love. Meanwhile both have relationships in real, non-electronic mail lives... Hanks with the incomparable indie darling Parker Posey (he splits up with her after they have been stuck in an elevator and she starts freaking out because she cannot find her Tic Tacs) and Ryan with a splendid Greg Kinnear. It is a feel good movie above all, although the important issues of online communication AND corporations ruling the world are serious issues that can be debated in some other venue. Also nice... Dabey Coleman as Tom Hanks's father and also Jane Adams for only moments as a tv host-interviewer who captures Kinnear's heart during an interview. (The keen indie movie follower and Frasier fan will know Adams as Niles's plastic surgeon girlfriend Mel. They will also recognise her bit part in Wonder Boys as the pregnant waitress Oola and as the down on her luck character who never quite wins in the disturbing Happiness)."
193,5.0,Amazing how much I related to this movie. It was freaking funny!
194,5.0,"okay so here's the deal:

payback is based off of a book called ""the hunter"" by richard stark (donald westlake). it's dark, gritty and awesome. the original idea for the film was a lot like the book. but the studio got squeamish and re wrote the whole thing, so we got the original ""payback"": a quirky dark comedy about crime.

payback straight up is what the movie was originally supposed to be and it's way closer to the book! so before you watch it know that. it's not very funny (although it still has it's funny moments to be sure!), it's not supposed to be cute and porter is more dark and not such a good guy in this version. again, that's how the source material is, it's a dark book!

i love both versions, but i may not have if i hadn't read the book.

so consider reading it before you decide this version of the film is terrible. i watched the original cut, then read the book, then watched this. so if you do that you get the best of all worlds: a fun dark comedy (payback), a dark gritty book (the hunter), and a lively film that is a fairly true adaptation to the book (straight up).

amazon has the terrible habit of considering different editions of a product the same thing, so all the reviews for the original payback (which, as i've said is a totally different film) are being lumped together with the reviews for payback: straight up! this is probably one reason people are freaking out and so disappointed. people who haven't seen either hear that payback original edition is a funny crime movie with some grit and read reviews for it on the straight up page and end up with that one. then they're shocked at how dark it is. and people who know they want payback original edition have the same problem. then there's probably people who heard how funny the original is and read reviews on it's page about how dark and serious straight up is so they don't buy it at all! silly amazon. wonderful site, but some of these mistakes are just ridiculous and probably cause loss of profit for amazon and affiliates.

finally i'll say: a ton of people are SOOOO appalled by the fact that porter smacks around his wife at the beginning. let's examine this: porters wife shoots him FOUR times in the back, takes all his money and runs off with his partner, leaving him for dead, choking in a pool of his own blood in a parking garage. he barely survives and makes it back home months later.

i'm very much against violence against women, heck i'm against violence period, i spend lots of my time reading buddhist scripture, meditating, and finding ways to get rid of bugs that invade my space without hurting them. but when i'm watching a movie about a sociopath thief/killer i don't imagine he's a wonderful husband. that being said, maybe we're lucky all he did was smack her a couple of times?

if he was a really nice, regular guy and he hit his wife for nothing but looking at him cross eyed then by all means be VERY appalled. the audacity of a film writer to make such a character! my word! but come on people, sociopath thief/killer, VERY p*ssed off (And justifiably so) smacks his wife around. why are people surprised or offended by this?

oddly enough, not a single reviewer thought it was wrong that she shot him four times with the intent to MURDER him. they just watch him gurgling in his blood and eat their pop corn, they take a sip of soda as mal kicks him as hard as he can in the gut even though he's already laying on the ground dying, but he smacks her months later in response to this and the popcorn falls on the floor as they stand up in outrage, the soda is spat out and it's just the worst thing ever. i don't get it. attempted murder with a gun causing severe internal injury with months of recovery is small potatoes but responding to that with one short outburst of violence that did no apparent damage beyond maybe minor superficial injury (like the emergency room people would just tell you to go home because you're fine) is over the line. okaaay...

and her reasoning for shooting him? he cheated on her! his reason for smacking her a few times? being shot four times, robbed, and left for dead... i'm at a loss."
195,4.0,"When I first heard that Mike Judge had a movie coming out a few years back, I was not interested.  Nothing against Beavis and Butthead, but it just didn't seem like someone responsible for that could come up with a live-action movie that would really stand out to me, and the fact that it started from a tiny cartoon that was so exceedingly simple that it probably could have only been funny for the minute in which it took place.  By the time it was out on video, something convinced me to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did.  This movie is a joy to watch, and it never ceases to keep me laughing even after seeing it multiple times.  Judge has changed very mundane facets of the working life into hilarious scenarios: from driving to work amidst traffic to theme days at work, he caught it all.  Basically, it's freaking hilarious!"
196,5.0,"This is definitely my favorite comedy of all time.  A combination of extremely irreverent humor, graphic sex jokes, and poking fun at evil.  This movie is epically freaking hilarious!!!  The first time I saw this, I thought I was going to stop breathing I was laughing so hard.  I don't like this show anymore but I will always love this movie, and for anyone who the proper sense of humor, this is a requirement for your collection!!!!"
197,3.0,"Back in the summer of 1999, The Blair Witch Project was a huge deal. The commercials for it claimed that this was a true story, with the movie being what was filmed by three people in the woods who were never found. They were very careful with the marketing for this movie, and nearly everyone you talked to about it was convinced that it really was found footage. Even the official website had articles and police reports regarding the incident. Once people saw the movie, and the credits started to roll, it was clear that it -was- just a movie. Still, I cant think of many other horror movies that got as much attention as The Blair Witch Project did. There were a lot of plans for the franchise, with several alternate movies, including one from the witchs point of view as she followed the filmmakers in the woods, and a few others. Luckily, we only got one sequel. Had this movie come out recently though, Im sure wed have 6 in the span of 3 years and even a prequel.

I was 14 when the film came out, and I gotta be honest- I made fun of the movie for a long time after watching it. I thought the whole thing was dumb; that the movie was just three kids shaking a camera around, swearing more than the average stereotypical sailor, and freaking out over dumb things. A few years passed and I watched it again to remember how bad it was, and I started to appreciate the movie for what it was. This was the first real big found footage movie, doing a lot of things right that 99% of other found footage movies even today don't get right. You felt like you were right there with the kids, who didn't know what the heck they were doing in those woods, getting more tense as time went on. I just watched the movie again tonight, to try and get more in the Halloween spirit (especially after the trash I watched last night), and I feel the same as I did a few years ago. Its a movie everyone should see once, but its definitely not for everyone. Most people will either love it or hate it. It all depends on what you like, and what scares you.

Everyone should know the story by now- a young woman named Heather is doing a project about the Blair Witch, and she goes into the woods to film her documentary with her friend Josh and a more experienced recording guy they recently met, Mike. Theyre packed with food, tons of backup batteries and film, a tent, rain gear, everything. Theyre ready to head out to the woods and film whatever they can. Things start out easy enough, with Heather interviewing local townspeople, asking them what they know about the Blair Witch. It turns out that the witch may be connected to a child murderer who used to live in the woods they're going into, and some locals claim to have seen mist or dew moving around and forming in certain spots by the river. Nevertheless, the group head out and enter the woods. On the second day of filming, things get weird, with strange noises being heard outside their tent, and they also start to find things like piles of rocks that must have some kind of meaning. As time goes on, they start to lose faith in one another, once Heather admits that she got them a little lost. Its not long before everyone wants to get out and back home. Given that this is a found footage film, and you already know they were never foundits clear that they don't make it home.

I should give a fair warning to anyone who still hasn't seen the movie- this is one of those horror movies that leaves a lot to the viewer. If you're the kind of person who HAS to see whats going on, or HAS to know exactly what something is or means, you should stay away from this one. A lot of people I know were very dissatisfied with the ending too, despite being invested in the movie from start to near-finish. My 14 year old self was too, though now I kind of like it (although I still think it could have been done better). What I like about the movie now is how much it feels like it really is found footage. Its not all shot on a single camera, and the lack of crystal clarity with the picture quality gives it a gritty look, like a VHS tape, giving it a little something extra in the visuals. Because only one person has the audio recording gear, dialogue and ambiance is all over the place, especially near the end. This is a movie thats shot by amateurs in the woods in the mid-90s, with a large portion of it happening at night when they wouldnt be able to see much, and thats exactly what you're seeing too. Keep that in mind. These are regular people, not survival experts, not expert martial artists, not soldiers, but regular college kids. Theyre terrified of whats out there, and of not getting out of the woods. With how much they argue and how scared they get, its hard to not feel bad for them. Its hard to say much more about the movie without spoiling anything, so Ill just say that, even though I think the movie is just ok now, I still like to read about it on various sites to see if there are any answers to the many questions people have about it.

Since the films release, weve seen an ungodly amount of found footage movies, especially in the last 5 years. The only notable ones Ive seen are Rec and to an extent, Troll Hunter. The problem with a lot of recent ones is that they show too much (a problem with horror movies in general lately). Blair Witch may have shown too little, but its the suspense that gets you more than anything. Just give it a shot- its short, moves along quickly, and may leave you wanting more.

Have some mashed potatoes ready when you watch it too."
198,4.0,"The Blair Witch Project:

I remember when this movie was first being previewed before it came to theaters...  Everyone was so hyped to see it, including myself!  I went the first week it opened, with my boyfriend at that time...  We were all excited, and couldn't wait to be terrified by this awesomely scary movie...  And I remember walking out of the theater thinking ""WTF?  That wasn't scary.""  We both felt robbed of our money and our time...

That said, I have since watched it at home and will say that it really does tend to be scary.  At the time when it was released onto VHS, I lived at home with my parents whose house was out in the country, with forest on two sides.  I got the VHS and watched it one night when I was home alone.  And finally, I felt a little of the terror that this movie was supposed to induce.  The forest, at night, is a scary place.  Especially when you're lost!  So, yeah, I can totally imagine freaking out if while lost I seemed to be traveling in circles all the while creepy stuff keeps happening around me!

So there you have it: the creep factor is there for this movie, you just have to watch it in the right setting.  This movie manages to be scary without a lot of blood and gore, which is great in my opinion.  For what this movie is, I say it's well done.  Just don't watch it in the middle of the day and expect to feel its full effects."
199,1.0,"I remember still being a young pup in college, wanting to see this; I had to practically beg my co-workers on my knees for someone to go with me to see this, but they all bowed out! I should have taken their advice...

  I received this as a VHS copy for Christmas later on, and I can't believe how freaking stupid this movie was! All it was was about 3 nimrods cussing like sailors out in the forest, and then the witch kills them. Probably not since the Wizard of Oz have I cheered on the actions of a witch!

  I don't know what horrible movies you have seen in the past that you would recommend others to kindly stay away from (this movie is second only to ""The General's Daughter"" in my book""), but please, please, please do not watch this if you have never seen it before!"
200,2.0,"I give this film 2 stars because it has one great idea.  Unfortunately, it lost a lot in the execution.  For one thing, real documentarians do not film every petty disagreement, and watching argument after argument gets a little tedious.  Second, the characters are not sympathetic in the least.  They act stupidly (one throws away their map?  Why?  Good question) and do little besides swear at each other.  Some scenes, such as the much imitated ""God I'm so scared"" scene could have been effective  if we had been able to develop any sympathy for the characters. Finally, although being lost in the woods is a frightening situation, we are supposed the believe they are really afraid of some gothic horror menace.  Said horror is kept off screen, and when done well this can be very effective.  In this movie, it is done poorly, and thus it looks silly.  We have the characters freaking out over a pile of rocks and a tree with stick figures hanging on it.  I mean, come on, STICK FIGURES!  I can only attribute this movie's success to America's starvation for innovative entertainment.  This starvation has led the American public to eat dirt and call it classic cuisine."
201,1.0,"This movie is considered one of the worst movies ever made, and for good reasons. A stupid plot, atrocious acting, and laughable special effects. This shark somehow holds a grudge against the protagonist of the first 2 Jaws movie, Martin Brody, apparently because he ""killed its friends."" Lol. Also, how does a shark travel from New York to the Bahamas in 3 days? (Also it was following a boat the entire time) Better question: Why would it feel hate against a human being? Better question: Does Ellen have some kind of psychic link to the shark? Because whenever the shark attacks someone Ellen knows, she gets a feeling of dread, which is kooky-talk. Why does the shark roar? Sharks don't have lungs or vocal cords. Why is the tagline for the movie ""This time, it's personal"" when in Jaws 2 a character (I forgot her name) told Roy ""Sharks don't take things personally."" ??? And why is it set at winter time?! And the way Martin Brody died. Oh my Jesus. Roy Scheider was smart enough to say no to the last 2 Jaws movie, so they killed him off in the most ridiculous way possible. Apparently he died of a heart attack because of the fear of the shark. I don't know about you, but when I kill 2 sharks as awesomely as Martin did in the first 2 Jaws movie, I wouldn't be very scared of sharks either. The editing is also choppy. Just a bunch of cut out footage and a bit of squirming from the actors and a little fake blood and that's literally every death in the movie. They even sped up footage of Ellen's hands reaching for the fridge! Why was that necessary?! And don't get me started on the special effects. The green screen is just terrible. I can do a lot better with a freaking iPad. And the shark is out of the water most of the time. In the last confrontation with the shark, you can actually see the mechanism propelling the shark forwards. (Also, in the scene, Michael Caine was attacked by the shark, somehow survives, and goes in the water and emerges, with a wet shirt. In the next shot, his shirt is completely dry. Magic?) And how does impaling the shark make it blow up?

Whatever. I bet Roy Schieder is rolling in his grave right now, and he died years after this godawful atrocity came out. Only buy it if you're looking for some laughs or if you're a critic who wants to rip this movie apart."
202,5.0,"this is a nice movie about first falling in love.
Freddie Prinze and Julia Styles meet at a bar and fall in love. you go with them through out their relationship and you watch them grow and learn.
a nice movie with a good cast. the cast includes Austin Kutcher, Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions), Shawn Hatosy (The Facutly), Rosario Dawson, Zak Orth and Henry Winkler.
i enjoyed this movie every much because it's a feel good movie about first falling in love. it's also more down to earth, more real life than some other cheesey love movies. but this movie just doesn't deal with love, it deals with friendships and growing in life as a person. Shawn Hatosy is freaking awsome in this movie. i also like Monk. just a very feel good movie.
this movie also happens to have my favorite song of all time, Al Green's Let Stay Together. Not only does this song come out in Down to You, but Julia Styles also dances to the song.
a very nice movie.
i liked it."
203,1.0,"I seen the documentary and I think that he seems like a nice guy in person and a family man, but the way he fights it is like he's going to kill his opponent when he punch the weak part of the body, the kidneys. His training is art but the way he fights is no art at all. I have experience Grappling styles, similiar to Gracie's Jiu-Jitsu and I think it is no art when you freaking choking someone by the neck and punching the kidneys, you might as well kill the guy."
204,4.0,"""MISSION TO MARS"" begins in 2020 with the introduction of all the crew members and their families at a farewell celebration before the launch of NASA's Mars One spaceship. The Mars Two will launch a year later and relieve the first team. We'll get to know all the members and their backgrounds so we can sympathize as they die horrible and agonizing deaths. Sound exciting, right? Well you be the judge.
 The first team lands safely and the Martian landscape looks pretty convincing so after about a year of chipping away at rocks and probing our scientists finally have to investigate a strange looking object at the peak of a mountain. They point a radar at the thing and boost the power, they shouldn't had done that. All kinds of bad things begin to happen. Turns out the Martians left the security system on.
 A grainy static frizzy message is bounced off a Martian satellite to Earth for help and the Mars Two team has to rush and prepare a rescue mission. The weird thing is the ship is renamed the ""Mars Recovery"". Which I'm to understand means you're too late for a live rescue and it's now considered a recovery. You know,like in recovering bodies.
 Anyway, our heroes back on Earth take off to Mars and wouldn't you just know it, minutes before orbital insertion freaking meteoroids, pebbles in space that's going to really screw up the paint job on your new rocket ship. The good news is it's still under the sixty five million mile warranty. Bad news is they fix most of the holes except the most important one on an external fuel line and blow their ship up. Don't give up hope, after a major sacrifice and we go through the sad scene, we find most of our guys safely down on Mars. The wife of the poor guy that sacrificed himself seems to have recovered and she's okay now. If we learn anything from this movie it's that husband and wife teams are not a good idea on long trips in space or in my case the mall.
 They find the sole survivor and repair the Mars One ship but before they return to Earth they have to tempt fate once more and go poking around that old Martian relic.
 They figure out the message left by the ancient people and are shown the secrets of creation. Turns out Creationists and Big Bang Evolution theorists were both wrong and we lose another astronaut. Well not so much as lose but he doesn't go back to Earth. He was pouting all through the movie anyway because his wife became ill and died while they were training at NASA for the first Mars' mission, blah, blah, blah.
 Okay, I'm a huge fan of just about anything to do with Mars so I'm going to give this movie four stars just for the background and effects. I think it's worth a look. I also recomend ""Red Planet"" offered here on AMAZON at a great price and you don't even have to leave home to buy it.
 Please be kind to animals and report any abuse. Remember, without people the world would be a much better place, so do something.

205,4.0,"Now, modern interpretations of Shakespeare are welcome in today's society, but sometimes I wonder is if this really what Shakespeare had in mind. I think Julie Taymore takes it a bit too far here in her feature debut, ""Titus"", based on Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, his bloodiest play.
Anthony Hopkins plays Titus Andronicus, a triumphant and veteran Roman general who returns home to Rome for the last time to bury the dead and retire. The Senate is ready to proclaim him Emperor when he denies and reccomends the thrown to Saturnius (Alan Cumming), who is weak and impressionable. He eventually takes Tamora, queen of the Goths (Jessica Lange) as a wife. It all starts going downhill from there. Tamora's two sons rape an brutally assault Lavinia, Titus' daughter. When her uncle discovers what has been done to her, it is a gruesome scene. Lavinia in the swamp will be a scene I never forget. But, this is Shakespeare, so the film is about the breakdown of Titus, not of the Empire. Hopkins portrays what has to be one of the best of his career - he's always seemed to be a reserved kind of actor, not wanting to risk his body because of his age, but in ""Titus"" he's on the ground, climbing, freaking out, moving, the whole deal! Incredible!
But, this is Shakespeare, so sit back and relax for 2+ hours of big words and actors talking so fast you've got to backtrack. I think Taymor's only flaw is that she put too much emphasis on the costumes and scenery - I know it's what won all the awards - but it just gets too much in the end. It's almost sensory overload for your eyes. Eliot Goldenthal's score, however, is a feast for your ears! He mixes jazz, classical, and opera all in one score - fantastic. To sum it up, ""Titus"" is a stylish bloodbath (oxymoron?) with the true Shakespeare enviroment, even down to the asides, where the actors look right into the camera and into your eyes.
""Titus"" makes you feel uncomfortable at times with violence, dazzle your senses through sight and sound - and may even make you feel dirty...incredible how a bard over 500 years ago could do that even today."
206,4.0,"I watched The Grey Zone yesterday and am still feeling quite disturbed.
First things first, Steve Buscemi is one of my favorite actors but I'm not sure he quite fit in in The Grey Zone.  I also like Harvey Keitel but was not really feeling him in his role.  I am assuming we are all supposed to pretend the actors were Jewish or Hungarian or German, etc. Then why is it some characters were given accents and others weren't?  And like everyone else who has reviewed the movie, I feel the ""F"" word was way over used.  It definitely took away from the overall authenticity of the time period in which the movie took place.  It seemed almost as if the characters were hanging out on the corner somewhere in NYC, arguing over a bad card game.
Aside from the above, The Grey Zone succeeded in freaking me out beyond belief.  The live people going in to the gas chambers only to come out dead, shoveled into the fire and dumped into the river are images that will be with me for a while.  The scene in which they painted the gas chamber walls had the most impact on me.  Imagine them painting over the mess the people left behind as they were gassed to death?  The musical score was quite perfect.  Sad, dark, bleak.
The story was interesting and the acting was decent enough.  Do not not watch this is you're not ready to be disturbed for at least the rest of the day (or night)."
207,5.0,freaking awesome show. (if you like that type of stuff)
208,5.0,Great freaking movie
209,2.0,"I was a teenager when the phantom menace first came to theatres. I only saw the film twice as opposed to dozens of times I had viewed the original trilogy. I though I had simply grown out of Star Wars and that's why I couldn't get into the prequels. A week ago, I watched the prequels for the first time since I viewed them in theatres. Wow, turns out it wasn't me just growing out of Star Wars, these are just really bad movies period with the phantom menace leading the awfulness. I wanted to like these films, I tried to like them but I just couldn't.

Phantom menace-Really, really bad. I don't know where to even start. The script is not well developed. Do we really need a movie to show councils meeting and sitting around the whole time? Nope. The trade disputes just should been left in the opening scroll. The cgi is terrible. There is one scene towards the end on Naboo showing tanks sitting on green hills. It's very brief but I swear in one shot, there are only three colors, green, khaki, and blue. Very little detail whatsoever. Characters are totally flat. I was really excited to learn of anakin's childhood. There isn't much  in the movie at all about him. He raced a pod, and was supposedly a great pilot even though auto pilot took him into the battle above Naboo? Jar jar f*cking binks. Incredibly annoying and totally fake looking.
Attack of the clones-Gag me. Christian whatever his name was so terrible in this movie!! I don't usually notice bad acting but it's impossible not to notice in this film. The love story is totally lame and not believable between him and padme. There's no ""I love you,"" ""i know,"" moments like with Han and leia. It's not interesting at all to watch. Again cgi was bad.
Revenge of the sith-Christian what's his nuts acting has much improved. Definitely a noticeable difference. Again the cgi sucks and totally detracts from the film. In fact, that all this film is really; cgi with some real actors thrown in looking exactly like, well they are standing in front of a green screen. No interaction with the environments at all. Way too many lightsaber battles too. They all looked really fake (big surprise). While I always wanted to see yoda in action, his cartoonish (again bad cgi) appearance with his ridiculous somersaults are so freaking cheesy. And what's with grievous having light sabers?
I don't consider myself a Star Wars fan boy, but I can definitely see why people prefer the original trilogy. The prequels are just mediocre films at best. Watching them was a chore."
210,1.0,this is such a stupid freaking movie. no one should watch it. its terrible and the visuals are very phony. i mean who can jump off a roof.

215,4.0,"***This review may contain spoilers.***

For decades the predominant theme of the superhero universe is that possessing super powers is a stressful burden fraught with peril, lack of reward, and worst of all, an ungrateful public. The Marvel pantheon has promulgated that realistic but depressing notion through almost all its characters (notably the Hulk, Spiderman, the Thing, and especially the X-Men) to such a pervasive degree that DC Comics, home to the ""demigod"" Superman, had to follow suit. Superman, formerly invincible and infallible, suddenly became saddled with multiple vulnerabilities, inhibitions, and doubts. Again, this realistic approach is thought-provoking and an important factor in the success of the ""Spiderman"" movie franchise. But let's be honest; if you had a super power, ANY super power, wouldn't you have the time of your life?

""The Incredibles"" answers this question with an exuberant ""yes!"". I will not dwell upon the movies many virtues, since other posters have already done a thorough job of that. I wish to emphasize that ""The Incredibles"" succeeds to a large degree by inverting the above-mentioned Marvel superhero theory, ""regressing"" back to the 50's and 60's and reminding us that, in the final analysis, being a superhero is freaking great. Bob Parr (aka. Mr. Incredible) revels in his abilities and his responsibility to humanity. Unlike with Spiderman, et. al., his powers are not a curse but an unadulterated blessing and his raison d'etre. Unlike Spiderman, et. al. he does not want to be a normal member of the herd, to be equal to them. He wants to be, and is, different, and better. That's why his speedster son Dash (a.k.a. Dashiel's) remark that ""when everyone is special, no one is"" resonates. Mr. Incredible was wasting away in Conformityville; to survive and keep his sanity, he had to put on the tights.

""The Incredibles"" is thus not a scathing satire of superheroes, except for a few jabs at Mr. Incredible's spare tire, and Ms. Mode's hilarious montage on the dangerous absurdity of capes (for which archvillain Syndrome apparently did not get the memo). It treats superbeings with respect, and not just Mr. Incredible. As the movie unfolds, it progresses from a stately (perhaps slow) state of domesticity and family to a crescendo of Action with a capital A. Of course, ""The Incredibles"" does acknowledge and juxtapose super heroism with reality (at least the reality of tortuous lawsuits, oppressive ""Dilbertseque"" corporate workplaces, and the unpleasantness of adolescence through Dash and Violet). But the movie eventually and gloriously breaks free, and so do Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Dash, and Violet!

The only ""flaw"" I could perceive in ""The Incredibles"" is its somewhat derivative nature and amalgamated blend of every superhero, James Bond, Spy Kids, and Powerpuff Girls conceit ever revealed. So what? Good for the movie! I eagerly await the family's next adventure and perhaps the obligatory ""origin stories"". I hope the sequels continue to keep the proceedings fun.

A few random observations:

1. Mr. Incredible has his foibles (his expanded gut, his initial neglect of his family, and his occasional Buzz Lightyearesque imperiousness), but he is no buffoon and no joke by any stretch of the imagination. His family is recognizably human but quite laudable.

2. In an early scene in the movie, just before Mr. Incredible in his younger days confronts supervillain Bomb Voyage, the illumination hitting his old suit makes him look like Green Lantern.

3. The Omnidroids Mr. Incredible and family battle resemble a cross between Dr. Octopus's tentacles and a bathysphere.

4. Brad Bird must be a Fantastic Four fan!

5. Evangelical Christians will probably be aghast at Baby Jack-Jack's climactic encounter with Syndrome (which got the loudest cheer from the theater audience I was involved in).

6. Though spawned by frustrated geeky fan-boy aspirations, I thought Syndrome made a formidable and even occasionally sympathetic villain, channeling both the Joker and an evil Mask (as well as, ahem, Heat Miser of course).

7. One cannot trademark a superpower.

8. I wonder if Marvel will ever contract with Pixar to do a comic rendition of ""The Incredibles"".

9. Apparently Mr. Incredible possesses strength in the ""Class 100"" range, easily able to bench over 100 tons. But does he possess other powers? He cannot fly under his own power, but is he invulnerable, have optic and auditory powers, etc.? What are the extent of his family's abilities?

10. I'm glad the Parrs did not have a super-powered pooch or other pet a la Krypto, unless that comes up in the sequel.

11. The PG rating is warranted. Pre-preteeners will find the movie by turns a bit too intense and slow-going, as the occasional infantile whines in my movie audience can attest to. Savvy adults and older teenagers will probably enjoy the movie the most!

By the way, I bought the DVD."
216,4.0,"...and yet I left the theater unfulfilled.  So now I'm really perplexed.  I love all forms of animation (done well) and I do enjoy well choreographed Kung-Fu action.  This film was at least, better than average in those departments.  I appreciate good voice-over work (it's not that easy) and humble characters; check and check.  Of course, solid story telling and really cool set pieces can make any film memorable.  Kung Fu Panda has all of the above.  So I'm still struggling with the fact that I left the theater less than blown away. I guess I should dissect the situation.

-WHY AM I JADED?
Perhaps I've seen too much animation (is that possible?).  With all the great computer animation that goes on these days, what will it take to impress me?  Prior to KP, a preview for the new computer animated ""Clone Wars"" film was shown.  While 10 years ago, this would have been an event, today it looked pretty crappy; my wife and I sneered.  You'd think KP would look awesome after seeing that.  It probably did look awesome, but what haven't I seen computers do before; nothing.  So, I probably am jaded.  Honestly, most of this film was beautifully done, but it didn't seem to matter; that's really disappointing for me.  No sure answers here.  I'm still missing something.

-WAS THIS A GOOD STORY?
There was absolutely nothing wrong with this story.  It had originality while still paying proper homage to the Kung Fu film traditions.  It had funny moments and beautifully choreographed battles.  It had numerous wonderfully original set pieces to stage the battles and events in.  It had strong continuity and meaningful plot points. It was as predictable as most ""Kids"" films are but still well thought out.  Yet, I felt something was missing?  So far I have managed only to find more questions than answers.  Let's look at the details.  Maybe I'll figure it out there?

-BLACK IS BLACK (I want my baby back?)
Of this I am sure, the panda was Jack Black.  Just as Robin Hood was Kevin Costner and Han Solo was Harrison Ford, Jack black is usually himself regardless of the role.  I like Jack Black (at his worst, I find him tolerable).  However, here he was playing an American Panda.  I couldn't let this slip by.  I could not ignore his American colloquial speech or his fan-boy demeanor.  As loveable as his character was, he seemed completely out of place.  He was funny and charming and disarming and loveable, but he wasn't in any way Chinese.  I know this is ludicrous; he's a freaking Panda for gosh sake!!  But he was in China and he was all American.  As dumb as that is, it just bugged me.  A couple other voices bugged me too (Dustin Hoffman was also too ""American"").  Despite the good ""acting"", I guess this sort of damaged the context of the film for me.

-IS PAYING HOMAGE BECOMING CLICH?
I have produced yet another question (sigh).  How many films pay homage to classic Kung Fu cinema?  I honestly don't know.  I do know it's a lot.  I don't have anything against the genre; I actually enjoy those films.  But maybe I've seen too much?  Maybe it's getting just a little bit tired?  Perhaps I am, once again, jaded?  That really would be too bad since this film has some really cool fight scenes.  I think my problem might be that while paying homage, this film cheats; it's all done with computers.  Doing it with live actors is much more impressive.  My kids liked it though.  This might be a strong answer (finally).

-HOW DEEP IS DEEP ENOUGH?
GEEZE!!! ANOTHER QUESTION!!!  The point is, is there enough depth in these characters?  I'm thinking maybe not, especially for ""The Five"".  These are the Kung Fu ""masters"" of the film and yet, all we really know about them is their fighting styles.  They are all really cool on the surface, but have only a little depth.  Some fringe characters were more highly developed.  I'm not sure how you develop 5 characters more deeply in an animated feature.  I supposed being ""cool"" should be enough; jaded?  I've definitely seen worse.  Though fairly shallow, they are cool.

-DID YOU LIKE IT OR NOT MORON!!!???
That's the only question you want answered, I'm sure.  Well, obviously I was divided by this film; half of me admired its honesty, attention to detail and faithfulness to the Kung Fu genre.  The other half became distracted by annoying details that spoiled it's ""authenticity"" a bit.  Because this was homage to the Kung Fu genre, the story followed a somewhat familiar format.  So the story, though well executed, was not completely fresh. The action, though beautifully staged, was only a pile of bits and bytes leaping around the screen and not real people and therefore, less impressive. I guess my personal ""WOW"" bar has been raised by the limitless potential of computer graphics, and thus I have become a bit jaded.  Despite my lack of enthusiasm, I would have to recommend that you and your kids see Kung Fu Panda.  It is a well made film that should still excite young minds and un-jaded adults alike."
217,1.0,"If you've read the book ""The Manuscript Found in Saragossa"" you know that it starts super strong then devolves into a boorish don quixote book 3 attempt of some kind.  But the opening is so freaking strong its hard not to be impressed (and sadly disappointed when it loses steam).

this movie just doesnt have visual or dramatic power thats worthy of the source material.  If you don't believe me - just read the first third of ""Diary Found on the Road to Saragossa"" and you will realize how mediocre this film is.  The book (the first third or so) is phenomenal 6 or 7 star classic material."

221,2.0,"How was this movie not one of the greatest of all time? It was made in 1996, right in the golden era of B, and it was directed by the incomparable Aaron Norris yes the Aaron Norris. Taking it a step further, from the trailer you can see that Chuck morphs into both a hawk and a freaking bear. He also bought Vince Neil's hair from 1988 off ebay. Sid has been wanting to review this one for a long time and rightfully had very high expectations for it. We even thought we ensured a great viewing experience because we consulted the law firm of Chuck & Chuck. It seemed like a sure-fire 5 can effort but it was not meant to be. Don't get us wrong, this film was really b. When Chuck morphed into that bear it almost brought a tear to the eye. It should have been so sweet too but in the end they messed it all up. It was the last time street guys like Chuck were given a movie that B and turned it into an after school special.

Norris Sr. even had a sweet name in this one. He is McKenna, a guy in 1875 who lives on Indian land on a mountain and refuses to sell his land to people trying to build railroad tracks through McKenna's land. So the railroad tycoons kill him. Normally that would be game over, but come on man. This is Rick James. The spirit of the mountain brings McKenna back to life and turns him into a shape shifter. 120 years later, same basic deal. Except its loggers who are messing with lone wolf McKenna's land. They want to cut down the forest, including a group of 4 kids' treehouse. But Chuck said no way. He whoops some serious logger tail but its so goofy. At one point some guy's hat even gets shot off straight from a bugs bunny cartoon. What happened to the days of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hitman/dp/B000AYEL42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hitman</a>?

As we're writing this review we realize that on paper this movie looks freaking awesome but it was a year late like the Newmanium and thus quite lame. Oooh! Chuck was his usual fantastic self. He's always the perfect blend of total tough nut and where's my cheeseballs. Throw in this special variety of mullet and kicks that missed by a mile and Chuck was pretty good in this one. We're not into bashing kids but they killed this movie. Especially the little blonde girl. She couldn't have worked long after that. It's exceedingly possible that she's gotten a creepy footrub from Santa at some point if you know what I mean. I knew that you could. Anyway, this flick was B but it was an insult to the genre. Stay away at all costs, just check out the clip of Chuck morphing into the bear. It's by far the best part of the movie."
222,3.0,"So this isn't best anime feature in the world. Okay maybe that is an understatement. The art is dated, the subbing is awkward, and all that other jazz. But you know what? That is the best thing about this movie! It is so damn bad it is freaking hilarious, heck the opening battle scenes had me rolling on the floor with the fact they were fighting amidst holograms of dancing pop singers! And what is up with the singing? The singing is the best part! Hell I am little [irritated that] the characters didn't whip out any dance moves during their selected scores...
Just try to keep a straight face when Hibiki is placed in jail and he gives his ""heartfelt"" speech about media censorship or whatever...

223,1.0,"I thought this would be simi-interesting. I don't know why, I guess because Im a sci-fi person and even prone to liking some movies that don't make it big at the box office, but this was at the most confusing. One minute you're in the space ship with the doctors and everything, then sometimes you thrown back in Earth. Then say one minute you're at 1:30 pm (example not from movie but just for this post). Then the next you're like an hour before, then back to an hour and half ahead in time. Then of course you're flicking from the workers on the spaceship to someone reporting back on Earth about something.  Then the cameras are acting like they are self-shot by the astronauts which I find highly annoying. One point they flicked to people working on a problem but instead of focusing on them and what they're doing/what they're talking about you're focused on one person or another freaking out in the corner by themselves. This is highly confusing movie to follow."
224,5.0,This movie is so freaking awesome. Samuel L Jackson is the king of good action movies.
225,5.0,I always remembered this show for a few different reasons. Maybe because of how freaking stupid this guy was and some of the bizarre plots. I always remembered this one episode imparticular. The one where they build the submarine and put it in their bathtub. I always thought about that one whenever I would talk to someone about this show.  So when I saw they were availiable I had to get them both. But the only thing wrong is they need to release all of the shows. If you like weird comedy please buy and enjoy. If you don't get yourself straightened out and watch it as well.

her personality is so offensive you really want the little creature features to devour her.

I love that scene where they walk into the neighbors cabin, discover that it's flooded with gas and then she lights a match when she spots one of the critters..........OMG it's a special kind of stupid.

She runs off to that crummy a** crack of a shack that runs neck n neck with the worst of inner city public housing in the middle of freaking nowhere in a 30 year old VW Beetle. vintage doesn't even begin to describe this automotive nightmare; she still could have struck a better cash deal than that at the used car lot even with a crummy $50K.

this gal is seriously into pyrotechnics, sometimes deliberately, mostly due to her own incompetence, and yet she 's supposed to be a good shot; frankly I wouldn't want to be within a mile of that moron with a gun in her hands......maybe even 2 or 3 miles, I forget what kind of trajectory stray bullets are capable of.

I can't believe that sweet scientist dude fell for her, she's such an obnoxiously stupid bossy (expletive deleted) I hate her.
If the theoretical armageddon ever happened and I were a straight man and she was the only woman left, forget it, the world ain't startin' over.

Now the producers were obviously trying to cash in on the Alien series and I must admit the little creatures features didn't bother me, ok it wasn't high tech comp graphics but it kinda worked. SHE on the other hand is no Sigourney Weaver."
227,5.0,"When Sid was just a young little elf, there was no better way to start your Saturday morning then with a nice dose of WWF. Of course we were like 8 and not 27 at the time, so watching wrestling was truly normal for the age group. Outside of the Ultimate warrior nobody rammed the world like Brett ""The Hitman"" Hart did. We often thought ""man if we could get our hands on those fantastic pink robocop sunglasses, we'd be the coolest kids on the planet."" Well unfortunately the shades never worked out and either did the old boy Brett's career with the WWF. From the viewers standpoint it seemed to be the usual aging wrestler gracefully making his way out the back door. However after watching Wrestling with Shadows it was a totally different story. One that made you say to McMahon...I want to hit you, I want to hit you soooo bad!

As we stated in the previous paragraph Wrestling With Shadows explains exactly what happened to the Hitman's career. What started off as a situation where Sid said ""wouldn't it be hilarious to watch this Hitman movies?"" turned into an absolutely intriguing documentary. You really get to explore the studio space of the Hart family and in some odd way begin to legitimately like them. It documents Hart's 14 year career with the WWF from his moments as master of the house up to his sudden demise thanks to the crooked ways of Vince McMahon. The only thing good this wanna be meat head ever did was supply this planet with a daughter sporting a glorious rack. At least Brett smashed his face in, off camera, after the ultimate betrayal. It was somewhat similar to Vach's hand fork stabbing on Mr. Cross...yeah it was that satisfying.

Without a doubt Sid gives a full seal of approval for Hitman Hart: I want to wrestle you so freaking bad. It's the finest cinema to come out of Canada next to The Final Sacrifice. We even think we saw Rowsdower sitting front row at one of Brett's 1980's wrestling matches, or maybe it was some other drunk bloated hick. All we were expecting was to get a nice 90's B documentary under our belt, and wound up glued to the screen watching a true masterpiece. Sure Brett never dropped a coontz throughout the film but still managed to headlock us into a 5 star review. If you're a wrestling fanatic then you probably all ready own 4 copies of this on VHS, laserdisk, DVD, & bluray. But for the rest of the normal functioning world we implore you to watch this when you get a chance. Even if you never watched wrestling, it's just awesome."
228,4.0,I think I recall hearing about it at some point but never saw it. Very clever and provocative about the extent the TV networks will go to see advertising. I loved the scene where Truman is freaking out and the actress pretending ot be Trumans wife turns to the camera and does a commercial... to much. Jim Carrey as usual (you will recognize some of his trademark expressions) is great and well suited to playing Truman.
229,4.0,"Yet another great addition of Naoko Tachuchi's Bishojo Senshi Sailor Moon. This story takes place after the second season of Sailor Moon, or more commenly known as Sailor Moon R.
Usagi, Chibiusa, Ami, Rei, Makoto, Minako, and Marmoru are all taking a day off of fighting the forces of evil, and decieded to travel to a green house. Then a mysterious man appears calling Marmouru his best friend. But how can he be Marmouru's friend, if he dosen't know the idenity of this stranger?
The following day, when the girls are heading home from a day at school, Rei senses a great evil, and soon the girls are hot on the trail of a sinister plot. When they find an entire street full of unconcious people, it is then when the senshi realize that they are needed to save the world once again. The demon who was responsible approced the Sailor Senshi, but as always, the demon was killed. But then the same mysterious stranger that called Marmouru his best friend, appeared, revealing his true nature. His name is Fiore, and his has an unknown orgin from the great abyys of space.
When Fiore was young, he drifted aimlessly around space untill he landed on Earth. Upon landing his meet a young Marmoru. In the lonelyness and pain that Marmoru suffered from his being orphaned, Fiore suffered for not knowing just who is ture orgin was. Soon the two became inseprable friends, always joined at the hip. Yet all this joy would soon have to end. Because of Fiore's unknown and alien heritage, he had to leave his best friend behind, or else he would die. Just prior to leaving, Marmoru gave Fiore the only gift he received, a red rose. After saying his good byes to his best friend, Fiore vowed that they would meet again, and that Fiore would find the perfect flower to give to Mamoru upon his return.
For many, many years, Fiore searched the heavens for the perfect gift to bring back to his best friend. Then he found it in the form of a small pink flower, with the small torso of a demonic woman growing out of the center of the petals. This flower is called the Kissinian bloosom, was actualy the last element that Fiore needed to turn his pure heart into a heart of dispair and hate.
The Kissinian Bloosom was really a demon in an innocent form, who's only goal was the gather the engergy from every star and planet in every known universe. Alone, Kissinian is just anthoter ordinary flower, but once she has a pawn to do her bidding, she spreds her pods on unsuspecting planets. Soon the pods bloosom, and drain the energy from the planet, and the pawn is killed. She has been doing that very same process for millions of years. And the process would start all over again with her newest pawn, Fiore. By using Fiore's loyalty towards his friend Marmoru, she minipulates Fiore into thinking that Marmoru has been living a life of Hell on Earth. Out of his friendship for Marmoru, Fiore returns to Earth, in hopes of being reunited with the friend that he had once known, and to take is revenge upon the Earth by planting Kissinian's energy sucking pods on Earth, and turning the beautiful planet into a world of emptyness.
Soon, the Sailor Senshi embarke on the perilous task of entering space, and putting a stop to Kissinian's bitter plan. And to rescue Marmoru from the cluthes of Fiore. But has Fiore really lost all of his former purity? Can he be saved? Or will the Earth and the senshi fall into the hands of despair.
The dubb has a number of problems, and that is what keeps this DVD from getting five stars. But you can choose to watch the original, and get the qaulity of five shiny stars. In the dubb, why do most of the senshi have voices that sound like thirty year old women? Also, why dose Luna sound like a freaking old englsih granny? What the heck is a moon mama? Why is the theme song so freaking annoying, all it dose is says 'she is the one named Sailor Moon' over and over and over. It just gets annoying after a while. The wonderful Japanese song called Moonlight Revenge is replaced with Power of Love. But the song Power of Love was already entered in the next to the last episode of the R season. Like I said, the dub has problems, but you can always overlook that, and enjoy the splendor the the Japanese original"
230,5.0,"Yep, this is my favorite Ronald Reagan movie.

Cavalry? Yes. Military? Yes. Fun? Yes.

I've watched it a couple of times since purchasing it here on Amazon, and  I thought it was worth both my hard-earned sheckles and popcorn time.

Older westerns seem to be a turn-off with the psuedo-elite/liberal, extremism in America today. Oh, we were terrible to the Indians, we tricked the poor French, we stole the whole country and we should be ashamed of ourselves? Who's we, sucker? My grandparents were all immigrants that left crappy European countries around the 1900's because of extremism. And since when do you watch movies for political activism? You're supposed to watch them for escapism! Being a moderate, I detest extremist, especially when they attack something as simple and trival as a freaking movie or entire decades of freaking movies.

Chill, it's not real.

It's just a movie, fiction; entertainment.

And entertainment it was. Reagan is so larger than life and The War Between the States as we call it in Kentucky is shown about as fair as you're gonna get. I love this one and it compliments the grim atmosphere of ""Gettysburg"" and the whimsical turn of ""The Undefeated"" nicely.

I like all kinds of flicks, good ones, bad ones, serious ones and silly ones."
231,3.0,"This movie gets a lot of grief, and it's easy to see why.  A TV show from the childhoods an entire generation (it was made in the 1960s and syndicated as a rerun in the 1970s) is made into a movie at a time when the show is not fresh in anyone's minds nor readily available on home video.  The generation remembers adventure in the Old West with a James Bond twist, great production values and characters who were super cool.  Yes, that generation is right, but in the years that have passed, they forgot (like the makers of some of the recent James Bond movies) what made the show so much fun.  It never took itself quite seriously.

With The Wild Wild West available on DVD now, it's still cool to hate the movie and love the TV series even if you've never watched it or haven't since the 70s.  Well, I'm not going to comment on the collective's ability to dismiss what is a perfectly fun movie as trash while having no recent memory of the show the movie is based on.  What I am going to say is that Wild Wild West actually does a great job of bringing the spirit of the 1960s TV show to a modern audience.  If there hadn't been so much belly-aching when it came out, it could have started a new generation loving the old show.  Of course, Robert Conrad's outspoken criticism of the movie didn't help.

I am a big (read: freaking huge) fan of The Wild Wild West.  It combined the adventure of the Old West with the intrigue and suspense of James Bond.  The main attraction, of course, is the playful relationship between Jim West and Artemus Gordon (or, if you're a woman with simple tastes, Robert Conrad's sculpted behind in tight pants).  Each episode had a similar structure - Jim and Artie have to protect someone or something, that someone or something is stolen or kidnapped, they track down the culprit who turns out to be a lunatic with some strange idea of taking over the country or the world, Jim goes in with guns blazing and gets captured, Artie goes in with a disguise and breaks Jim out, then they both get captured and put in an elaborate death trap from which they escape using their genius and Artie's gadgetry, and, in the end, Jim gets the girl while Artie is left to make the coffee on the Wanderer (their train).  Each episode had its own take on that format, but that was sort of the standard plot.

Artie's gadgets on the show were usually simple - buttons that burned through wood, a derringer on a rail in Jim's sleeve, glasses that allow one to see certain chemicals.  The villains had more elaborate displays - a bubbling machine that runs on the brains of geniuses, a giant flamethrower cannon, and various death traps that used lightning or solar energy.  The king lunatic of their enemies was the resourceful Dr. Loveless, played by the absolutely irreplaceable Michael Dunn.

While there was no way a movie without Robert Conrad, Ross Martin, and Michael Dunn could entirely capture the spirit of the original show, the writers made an honest attempt.  In fact, besides the obvious story arc similarities, there were numerous references to the TV show including Selma Hayek's story which matches a first-season episode in which the main woman (Chinese rather than Mexican) turns out to be married.  Some of the gadgetry from the show appears in the film.  Dr. Loveless is probably the strangest deviation from the original show with his exaggerated southern accent and missing bottom half of his body rather than simply short stature.  The main criticisms most people have of the film are that it had too many one-liners and a lot of over-the-top machines.  As for the one-liners... the original show is full of them!  Jim and Artie make bad puns constantly, and Jim delivers one-liners with the gusto of the worst of James Bond (but still retains his awesome dignity because he's freaking Robert Conrad).  The machines were simply a product of modern movie-making.  The gadgetry of the original show would seem incredibly tame to modern audiences because it was stuff that could be built easily and quickly (and cheaply) for many episodes in one season.  In a movie, you can make a lot of big stuff or animate a lot of big stuff, so they did.  And all of the gadgets are pretty darn cool-looking, even the bemoaned giant spider.  It's funny, but at the time the movie came out, another movie came out called Atlantis: The Lost Empire.  This Disney vehicle was also criticized for being strange.  Yet, today people have realized that it was actually a neat movie because that steampunk aesthetic caught on.

Sadly, no one will accept that over-the-top steampunk look in Wild Wild West because they're too busy comparing it to their finest memories of the Wild Wild West TV show, and that's too bad because it's a fun movie.  Hey, whatever floats your boat, but don't go telling me that I shouldn't be having fun watching something I like."
232,5.0,"BuFFy is back here for a second and even better and more fun then the first season *if that is possible*..The ScOObieS lampoon more of the scary movie clitches'..Highlight episodes in my opinion are ""SchOOl Hard"" in which we are introduced to evil vampires villians Spike & Druscilla..Dru is played by Juliet Landau daughter of actor Martin Landau a actor who won an Oscar for portraying Bela Logosi and now is Daughter is known for playing Druscilla a vampire princess of the Night..She is truly the Beauty IN Darkness..And that voice she does just adds to the pleasure..And Spike so much can be said bout Spike..Spike is by far in my opinion the greatest most fun villian ever on tv..How come VillianS always get the best one liners?? Spike is freaking HILARIOUS..And he is without a doubt a scene stealer..And the chemistry between Spike and Druscilla is Pure or should i say Evil Magic through and through..SPIKE RULES..The people behind this show say they modeled them both after ""Sid and Nancy""..I can see that but even more Spike resembles that of Billy ""Rebel YeLL"" Idol..Another standout episode is ""Halloween"" in the words of Spike that episode ""Isn't this just....Neat????""..Definatly one going for the full comedy..My question why would WiLLow want to cover herself up like that..I don't want to say what i mean coz it will ruin it lets just say that this is the first time that WiLLow makes herself look that way..WiLLow is sexy anyway wait til you see her here..Another standout episode is "".....Bewitched....."" *can't remember the full title of episode and the box set is currently being borrowed by a friend*..In it Xander gets too much attension from the opposite sex..Another question how can he turn down WiLLow and BuFFy?? But hey i guess anything is possible on tv right..Between the ""Halloween"" and "".....Bewitched....."" episodes you may have a hard time getting your breath from laughing so hard..This season 2 you will also have loads of sight gags i won't ruin it by listing them..But all i say is watch carefully..One i would have done better..There is one part where WiLLow has a ScOOby Doo shirt on..I would have put them in ScOOby shirts that are most like them..Like Willow = Velma / BuFFy = Daphne / Angel = Fred / Xander = Shaggy..This is also the season where Angel goes evil villian..And when he does you can see how much funnier villians are..When he is good Angel he is more serious..But when he gets to be evil Angel he all of suddon becomes more like Spike..And Angel is letting the one liners fly..And Angel then gets funny and a great addition to Spike and Dru..In a interview the actor who plays ""Spike"" said ""Spike isn't really a bad guy all he needs is some Mother's love and some chocolate milk""..I think that sums up the silly corniness of this show and that is just way we love it..This Season 3 of BuFFy just keeps getting better with every episode *though i do feel that ""Bad Eggs"" was somewhat a weak effort but that is just my opinion*..BuFFy the Vampire Slayer is the ONLY modern day show that can be called an Instant Classic and can stand up along side shows that we grew up on..Nothing is as fun as BuFFy..It is very addicting..Brilliant show that never loses it's bites or blOOdy kiSSeS...Long Live BuFFy & The ScOObieS and of course Angel Dru and Spike too......"
233,1.0,"This is seriously the best that the world could gather to send to Mars?  Seriously?  No, really, are you freaking serious????  Their world deserves to die.  Really.  I shut the movie off after 15 minutes because I know better.  It plays out too much like a frat house get together rather than a mission to save humanity.

Every other website out there that's reviewed this got it right.  14% on Rotten Tomatoes should have told me something!"
234,5.0,"If you are watching this movie with the dwarf in the Red Room, you obviously love it.  It's Lynch at his best.  Surpassed only by Mulholland Drive as the most ""fun"" of his movies.  Morphing pictures.  Smeared lipstick.  Ray Wise at his most menacing. Grace Zabrinske freaking out for no reason. Mind-controlling music.  Need I say more?

For all those who are looking for the movie to make ""sense,"" then I suggest renting back episodes of Rizzoli and Isles or Monk and call it a day."
235,4.0,"Naturally, it's Twin Peaks fans that will get the most out of this film coz that's the audience this film was made for.  Sure, any fan of David Lynch will watch this movie whether they've seen the show or not, but it'll end up being confusing.  Even though it's a prequel to the series' events, it's made for those familiar with the plotlines from the show.  Characters will appear in one scene and will never be seen again, leaving those unfamiliar saying, ""who was that and what the hell did he have to do with anything?""  Not to mention Laura's killer not being a secret at all .  Even some fans were let down by this one coz many were expecting answers and probably ended up with more questions than anything.  Typical of Lynch though, eh?  The movie is definitely Lynch all the way.  It has the same slow, dreamy feeling of most of his films.  Of course it's full of oddball characters who's only purpose is to say goofy things and act weird.  But among all this strangeness, there is a story.  With an R rating, you get the feeling that this is how the series might have played out if Lynch wasn't bound by the restrictions of network television.  The first 40 minutes or so focus on the investigation of the girl murdered one year before Laura Palmer.  The investigators are played by Kiefer Sutherland and Chris isaak, who seem right at home in Lynch's FBI world next to characters like Agent Cooper, Albert Rosenfield and Gordon Cole.  Once that's done, we jump into Laura Palmer's last few days.  My problem with this is the fact that Laura comes across as extremely unlikable.  She's always screaming, snorting coke, screwing someone or freaking out somehow.  It makes it difficult to work up any sympathy for her considering you kept hearing in the series how loved she was by everyone in the town.  I do realize that it was said that in her last few days she began to act strange, and a reoccuring theme throughout the series was that she had a dark side.  I guess it does make sense that in her last few days the dark side would be at it's peak, but even with that said, she's still kinda irritating.  Also, the appearance of Agent Cooper(the star of the series, but more or less a cameo in the film) seems kinda forced, like he was required to appear coz it's a Twin Peaks movie.  His character had nothing to do with anything until Laura Palmer died, but in this film they try to work in some kind of psychic link/premonition thingee with him and Laura that doesn't seem to work so well.  Most fans won't care about this though coz they get to spend a little more time with their favorite FBI man.  Supposedly Lynch had to leave over an hour of this film on the cutting room floor.  In doing this, many characters from the show were completely deleted from the film.  Fans have been demanding these lost scenes for years now.  I don't know if these scenes would really clear anything up, but they'd certainly be fun to see.  Lets hope it happens.  All in all, an interesting movie if you've seen the show, and a confusing and seemingly pointless movie if you haven't."
236,1.0,Strangest freaking movie i have ever seen.  I watched it because i always thought it was a horror movie. I would not classify it as such. I did not care for it.
237,1.0,"This movie was so freaking predictable that, had I a notepad handy, could have written down the remainder of the plot after the first ten minutes. The scar tactics in this movie are so juevinile! There is only one shocking scene and that is the very first supernatural manifestatyion when Michelle Pfiffer enters the house and the stereo kicks on. Hey time to switch tactics right? Apparently not for the producers. At every point after that where there is supposed to be a scary scene the same BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO in your face tactic is employed. After the first one you are expecting all the rest! When they were in the bathroom fooling with the ouiji board I would have been more frightened if Wierd Al Yankovich had walked through the door suddenly. I and everyone else in the theatre who sat nearby had already figured Harrison Ford as the Perp(who had an affair and was tryin to cover it up) from scene 1. Furthermore I was just dissbelieving that Harrison Ford was a bad guy - bad guy for the part I guess. Dont buy or rent this it really blows!"
238,5.0,"Normally a movie this bad would get at a 1 star rating on Amazon. I haven't seen a movie THIS bad. It's bad down to every last little detail. The plot, the cinematography, the acting, the special effects, the script, the music.

So why did I give it five stars? Because it's the definition of ""So bad it's fun to watch"". I mean, I even own a freaking copy of this movie for that reason. Whenever I am down and depressed and need a laugh, I put it on for a good laugh. I mean, it's really a just an extremely crappy yet hilarious movie.

Like I said, every last thing about this movie is bad as hell. For one, I have read the book and it's bad as well, it reads like it was written by a monkey going crazy with a bunch of alphabetical fridge magnets. I couldn't remember the book though before watching it so I just decided to turn my brain off for some cheesy fun. Basically, the plot is a ripoff of Star Wars (different planet, Johnny Goodboy Tyler = Luke Skywalker) and Star Trek (the amazingly dumb ""Psychlos""). The psychlos are dumb enough to refer to humans as ""Man-animals"". Which makes me think... we drive ""Car-automobiles"" and go to ""Business-work""!!! Seriously!!!! How could you not laugh at the term ""Man-animal""????

The cinematography is one thing you'd notice almost immediately. Every shot is slanted at a 45 degree angle. It takes two seconds to get annoying and just adds to the general crapiness. Also, WTF is with those double door wipe transition? When the screen double door wiped into the credits at the end, I fell on the ground laughing (literally).

The DVD has a special feature called ""Creative Special Effects"". Yeah, they're creative alright. Creatively BAD, that is. They look like they were done on a MacIntosh computer. The film is shot in 67% purple-blue filters, which also gets annoying quick.

And the acting. Barry Pepper is basically Kristen Stewart in this movie. He rarely ever changes facial expression. Travolta's ""acting"" (I use that term very loosely) consists of over-emphasizing every word (While YOU were still learning to SPELL YOUR NAME!!!! I was being TRAINED to CONQUER GALAXIES!!!!!).

The ""music"" (I also use that term loosely) is a low point too, and sounds like a boom microphone being banged against the inside of a huge metal drum.

Also, for a good laugh, watch the movie with the commentary on. I guarantee you it's even funnier listening to Roger Christian's BS excuses for the choices in direction. I love how he keeps comparing it to comic books with ""Jonnie is a Comic Strip charatcter"" and other BS like that.

Overall, this movie is howlingly bad. But it's so bad it's hilarious, and I recommend it for that reason."
239,5.0,"While critics love to bash the two live-action versions of The Flintstones and the ratings at IMDb are surprisingly low, the first film was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because its a great movie for what it is. The second one came out six years later in 2000 and features a different cast, which is appropriate since the story is a prequel, taking place when the four main characters are in their late teens or early twenties and romance blossoms between the couples.

Although Mark Addy as Fred isn't as good as John Goodman, hes a more-than-acceptable substitute and, besides, Fred is much younger here so its fitting. Stephen Baldwin is even better (slightly) than Rick Moranis as Barney. Jane Krakowski is also better than Rosie ODonnell as Betty, not to mention one of the most beautiful women to walk the planet. As for Wilma, Kristen Johnston isn't technically as good as Elizabeth Perkins because the latter had Wilmas look to a T and Johnston is noticeably too tall, but she makes up for it with her goofy charisma that cant be beat. Lastly, who better to replace Elizabeth Taylor as Freds stepmother than Joan Collins?

Both Flintstones movies are easy prey to incessant panning because they're based on a 60s cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, do they work for what they are and the answer is a resounding yes! Movies must be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve, not according to what they arent. For instance, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" is a goofy comedy and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original ""Apocalypse Now"" it's a throwaway flick, but how does it stack-up to other silly comedies? Its the same thing with both Flintstones movies  how do they stack up to other live-action versions of cartoons? Are they amusing?

I always loved Gazoo and hes effectively brought to life in Viva Rock Vegas. The sets and F/X are top-of-the line and hold up to this day. Being a prequel, its natural to think that the producers lowered the budget, but this wasn't the case at all. The original cost $45 million while this one cost a whopping $83 million; but, while the first film raked in $360 million worldwide, this one only made $60 million.

Like the first movie, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barneys bond. Theyre best friends and their personalities balance each other out. Youll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.

The first two acts of Viva Rock Vegas are just as entertaining as the previous film, but there aren't as many laughs in the third act as the plot busily ties things up. Dont get me wrong, the third act is eventful and amusing, but there simply aren't as many laughs as the first two acts. Nevertheless, The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is entertaining from beginning to end as a live-action cinematic rendition of the cartoon and wisely doesnt overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.

The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Parmount Ranch, Agoura, California, and Page, Arizona.

GRADE: A-"
240,2.0,"When I was a kid I was a huge fan of Godzilla movies. I have very fond memories of making my parents take me to Blockbuster and picking out one of his many films on VHS. I saw just about all of them that were out at the time, from my favorites Godzilla VS King Ghidora and Godzilla VS Gigan to the not so great Godzilla VS The Sea Monster and Godzilla VS Mecha Godzilla. I think, up to Godzilla 2000, there were only one or two of his films that I hadn't seen. Needless to say the big G man holds a special place in my heart and he always will. I actually got to see Godzilla 2000 in the theaters way back in the day and my little brain could hardly handle the level of awesome I thought I was seeing. So how does this nostalgic classic I first saw when I was 11 live up now that I'm 24?

Not well, as a matter of fact. I mean yes, I get it, this is a Godzilla movie, I didn't pop this in expecting Shakespeare or even Pacific Rim. All I really wanted was to see the hero of my childhood beat up on giant rubber monsters and destroy Tokyo for the fiftieth time. As cheesy and insane as these movies are the Godzilla fights were, for the most part, at least entertaining. It must take a lot of stamina to wear that big rubber suit effectively and actually make some cool fight scenes, but whoever is wearing it in this film didn't seem to have any. Godzilla just sort of waddles around like a toddler occasionally flailing his arms around and opening his mouth a little bit. He has no movement, no energy, nothing to make him exciting. My wife said it best when she said the monster battles reminded her of two old people awkwardly trying to fight one another and just falling over themselves in the process. Yeah, that's kind of what this movie is like. A giant old person waddling around for an entire movie until a second old person waddles in and awkwardly fights the first old person. Weird, never thought I'd describe a Godzilla movie like that, but there it is. At least the G man looks cool and his fire breath is pretty neat, otherwise the fights were be the biggest bore fests I've ever seen.

I'm not even going to judge the plot and characters all that much. I mean, let's be real. The story is ridiculous, the acting is atrocious, the writing had me busting out laughing at many points at how bad it was, but we expect that from this kind of movie. I mean, they didn't help, but there comes a time where even with that excuse it's just way too silly to ignore. Like the end of the film when the main characters are explaining that Godzilla keeps protecting them because there's a little piece of him inside everyone while he's simultaneously destroying everything in sight right before their eyes. Protecting? He's freaking setting Tokyo on fire! On what planet is that considered protection?

In the movies defense at the time this was far and away the best of all the G films in terms of special effects. Take that with a grain of salt, mind you, as none of the G movies had anything special in terms of effects, but this one did look pretty decent. Though that may sound like backhanded praise, it's really not meant to be. The cities look great, the battles semi epic, and Godzilla is pretty damn cool. That Godzilla costume warrants the extra star all in itself. He looks great.

Well so much for that diversion into the films of my childhood. Though it did put a giant grin on my face to hear the Godzilla theme music as he smashes through Tokyo adult me just couldn't get into the spirit of things like eleven year old me could. Let's hope the Godzilla: King of the Monsters holds up better. Until then, cheers."
241,4.0,"One of Don Bluth's best! This is the animated Star Wars that time forgot. Ironically it was advertised as just that too, though as fate would have it, the adverts were no lie for a change.

All I have to complain about is the freaking sound track. It's that horrible Nu-Metal that I swear Disney them selves invented."
242,2.0,I am not going to take the time to tell you what this was about.  Basically because I have no clue myself.  This movie was so freaking hard to follow.  It was SO long.  I guess I understand.  The guy finally realized his family was more important than his job and drugs can have an effect on even the most unsuspecting families and pepole.  But holy man make it like and hour and a half amd save me the time.  Perhaps if I watch this again it will make more sense to me.  This was a good movie I think.  They just made it hard to follow.  Going from one story to another.  Over and over.  Give it a try I guess.
243,1.0,"This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen! Jared Leto, though an excellent musician in the groundbreaking band 30 Seconds To Mars, is a horrible actor! Ellen Burstyn, or whatever her name is, is a terrible old hack of an actress. She should be in a freaking retirement home. Jennifer Connelly is pretty awful too. The plot is boring, generic and full of Hollywood cliches. The only redeeming qualities are that Jared Leto looked totally hot and luckily realized how horrible of an actor he is so he moved on to music and made great albums."
244,2.0,"This film was a major disappointment. I expected so much more from the director of freaking ""Die Hard"". The direction, acting, and writing were all a joke. This film left you with the feeling that it was all just thrown together, and no one took it that seriously. There were lots of things in this film that just didn't make any sense at all. Someone explain: Why was that desert chase scene filmed in night vision? WHAT IN THE HECK WAS UP WITH THAT?! The editing was choppy and scenes were just thrown together. I gave this film two stars for one reason: The skateboarding scene at the beggining was sorta cool. Thats about it.
SKIP IT. ""Rollerball"" is a loser."
245,3.0,"Going in to see this movie, i was not concerned with historical accuracy.  It's a movie about a freaking resurrected mummy, for crying out loud, i think that should be anyone's first hint that viewers are in for a nice little detour from reality, and all tghe better for it.  Picking up several years after the adventures of the first film, we rejoin what is now the O'Connell family as they cross paths with Imhotep once again, this time in an effort to stop him from raising a supernatural army that would allow him to conquer the world.  The Mummy Returns is the sort of movie that makes a fun distraction on a lazy Saturday afternoon, not unlike the hokey, cheesy (but nonetheless entertaining) monster movies i grew up with.  If you can put down your pretensions that every movie should be or should even strive to be the highest form of art, make yourself some popcorn, sit back, put a few parts of your brain in neutral and just enjoy the ride.  Yeah, some of the effects bite pretty hard, but so what?"
246,1.0,"First off, I LOVED the first movie. Brendan Frasier was a great hero. BUT for Mummy Returns, all the movie trailers featured The Rock! And where was he? 30 freaking seconds worth in the prologue! Those of you who have read my reviews know I am big on cinematography and soundtrack. OK. The filming was very breathtaking. But the soundtrack was SO OFF! It rose where it should have been subtle, and faded when it should have punctuated. And soundtrack makes 50% of the film. Nice try with the surround sound, but a zither and bow saw would have enhanced this movie. Fraser did his beat, but he came out like a real sissy. This movie was more about Evie coming into her own. Long live women's lib. If it wasn't for some cheesy but nice special effects, this would be a chick version of an action film. Now, bear in mind, I watched this DVD THREE times to find something great, and all I found was the 2.5 seconds of Ak-san-amoon in the past, wearing the body paint top. Yes, there are some nice special effects eye candy, but in no way does this film live up to the greatness of the first.  THAT was a truly excellent film, on a par with the Indiana Jones films (okay, not the Temple of Doom) I am so sorry Brendan, but George of The Jungle and Blast From the Past where more fun to watch, and you ARE an actor with talent. You have proved that. Still, I did watch this 3 times. And I give it three stars. Oh my God. I must be getting soft..."
247,4.0,"Not Jet Li's best but don't think he had a chance. Jet Li is the rare find of a martial arts master who has great emotional range in film. But though Bridget Fonda is a great actress when she's by herself, she gives nothing to Jet when they share the screen. And, she had absolutely no sexual chemistry with him, something i cannot understand (is she an alien? i'd be freaking out just to be next to him!). The fight scenes are stylized to the point that the viewer doesn't get a lot of satisfaction. It just seemed too distant from Jet Li's crazy, scary but elegant style, which, btw - Unleashed is full of."
248,3.0,"The dinosairs looked more real this time.  The story was a little thinner this time.  It seems natural to capitalize on what the audience wants, big thrills.  If thrills are what you're looking for, you'll find one or two here.  For the most part, it provided what a summer movie should, high action, minimal story, but Tea Leoni was so annoying I hoped a dinosaur would just bite her freaking head off."
249,2.0,"A.I. is quite possibly the strangest and most disturbing movie I've ever seen. The special effects and the teddy bear were cool as hell, but the whole story was just freaking creepy."
250,5.0,"I purchased the double feature of these movies but the 1st movie didn't look like a blu-ray movie at all, so freaking grainy. Is the picture quality of this blu-ray version better? If so i'll buy this one & use the other one as a coaster!"
251,1.0,Damn they did it again they stil split the movie onto 2 discs this is really annoying to have to get up and change the disc in my Blu-Ray player. They freaking used BD50GB discs again instead of using BDXL100's All this really is a re-release of the same extended Blu-Ray again but with Ultra Violet Digital Copy instead of iTunes Digital Copy. I'll wait for the combined Hobbit Trilogy and LotR Trilogy Blu-Ray boxed set that will hopefully use BDXL100 discs that I won't have to put in a scecond disc half way through the movie.
252,5.0,"...I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re-release of these three films on DVD. A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again. Now I don't blame them. I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor. I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again. Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score.

In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they make a great buy. I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again. The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me. They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better. The only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc, you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie--which is really not a big deal. I highly recommend getting these to those that don't own them yet."
253,5.0,"2001 gave birth to ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", ending off the year with a slam-bang of a major wham and starting off the next year with the anticipation for the next chapter in the trilogy. The same pattern can be said for the following year.

But for those next two years, though the frustrations of waiting and compulsive disorder of being antsy was considerably high, the surprise factor slightly diminished. We all knew the next one wouldn't suck and would be equally amazing or even surpass the one preceding it. Though the fear of seeing a ""Star Wars"" redux was nigh to the heavens above, we all knew subconsciously Peter Jackson would never, ever make a mistake, much like what George Lucas did to the prequels.

So one great thing that I can say about ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" that I can't say about the next two that would come after it is that different kind of ""Surprise!"" factor. That feeling of ""Oh my gawd, I didn't know this is going to be utterly and freakingly cool!"". Nobody expected how amazing the whole LOTR Trilogy was going to be, let alone contemplating how mind-blowing the first was going to be. But that was exactly it. From the get-go, Jackson had already cemented the makings of classic cinema and boy, did he ever!

I was amazed and enthralled and on the edge of my seat during the long span in the darken theater. The smell of buttered popcorn, licorice and whiff of the misty cool AC in the air added a priceless element to the wide-eyed span of the equally mesmerized audience and the almost uncomfortable silence of hearing a pin drop. Not a cell-phone could be heard nor a child's cry disrupting the engagement. It was like a community sharing something spectacular, a communal feeling that no words could articulate. That is something that I will truly miss as bitterness and sadness continues to plug my sensitive heart, knowing that from now on, there will never be any LOTR movies in December anymore.

Meticulously done with passion, love and commitment for its source, satisfying the fans of the book, the geeky movie fanatics who haven't read the books and the average Joe-Six pack all at the same time, it's a big-budget blockbuster movie with a bigger heart that can usually only be found in independent films. Peter Jackson created a juggernaut of a milestone in recent cinema that will leave a lasting and permanent impression (""Seven Samurai"" or ""Gone With The Wind"" for our kids 30 years from now. An artifact of today's time that we'll always be looking back and experiencing the feelings it initially evokes, an art to be always admired and a guideline for many aspiring directors to draw inspirations from.

Faithful to the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien while sacrificing and tinkering some notable but not overly crucial events for the benefits of a different medium (not single qualm coming from me, although some Tolkien fans may disagree), Jackson made a tapestry of a long-overdue vision of a one true fan: the world of Middle Earth and its inhabitants. From The Shire, the miniscule Hobbits, Gandalf the Grey, the Balrog, The Ringwraiths, down to the costumes, horses and even hair and make-up . You name it, he got it. And all created in fantastic picture perfect detail. It's as if he knew what you've been conjuring up in your imagination all these years and just effortlessly transferred them on to a different canvas. Of course, it tremendously helped that he a.) opted for New Zealand as a setting and b.) chose Weta Digital, a non-Hollywood company to supervised the visual effects. The result is never a bombastic, garish and cold special-effects overdrive that usually plagues today's blockbuster movies, but a perfect combination of the flawless hard-beaten realism and delicate ethereality with a timeless ancient quality to it.

The music by Howard Shore, arguably his best work ever, brings the whole concoction to a perfect notch. Stirring, passionate, emotional with great usage of choir, angelic vocals and every instruments (well, except for electric guitar) imaginable, it's never fluff but as heavy and involving as the story unfolding on the screen. It's marriage made in heaven. The track called ""The Breaking of the Fellowship"" is powerfully heartbreaking and never ceases to bring a tear or two. In fact, I am crying right now. Sniff...

The direction of the movie is flawlessly articulate. The camera swoops and glides and flies, not a tool anymore, but a part of the world, along with the characters. Fast and furious in action sequences but intimate and personal in dramatic moments. There is that counterbalance that exists between the loud and the quiet, the brawns and the brains and the heart in this movie (and so forth throughout the rest of the trilogy) that tragically doesn't exists at all in today's blockbuster movies. Even so, like ""Spider-Man""  and ""Hellboy"", they can never top the mixture that the LOTR laid out.

""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" ranks on my list as cinema in its pure perfection. This is not just fantasy at it's finest, folks, but a serious Blockbuster movie with a heart and soul for the thinking man. Of course, rolled into one along with the following next chapters is heaven overkill. The Oscars won, always be remembered for its clean-sweep for ""The Return of the King"", rightly deserves their places on Peter Jackson's shelves. As a standalone movie, it is enough to juggle my inner geek to the core and I never cease coming back for more. Thus, I'll be going now for another fix. Toodles!"
254,5.0,"Joyce had never been to a scary movie with me before. I warned her that I could get very frightened and that she might not like the experience. (Neither hubby nor my brother-in-law like seeing scary movies with me after my freaking out on them in theaters. So I knew how bad I could be.) The amazing thing is that I figured out the big twist in this film within the first thirty minutes or so. Did this calm me down? Of course not! I was still scared! The plot line involves a woman waiting for her husband to return from World War II in its winding down aspect, circa 1945. She lives in a big house on the Channel Islands with her two children who must avoid daylight since they are allergic to it. Thus, the house is perpetually dark and gloomy, fitting the ghostly aspect of the story. Has this woman's house been invaded by ghosts or others and, if so, who are they? That is the crux of the thriller and it will have you on the edge of your seat. Nicole Kidman is superb in the lead role. When the film is well written, she is showing again and again that she has what it takes as an actress. Regardless of to whom she is married, she should be recognized as a considerable talent in her own right."
255,5.0,"Will you people KINDLY realize what work goes into making a good movie? No plot? Balderdash!! The Federation attempts to assassinate Padme. This leads Obi Wan to Genosia and Annakin from Coruscant to Naboo and back to Tatooine.
Turns out a former Jedi is conspiring with the Federation to secede from the empire, which eventually involves a showdown with the Jedi and a battle royal by the end of the film. This is a weak plot?? And in the OTHER camp...too MUCH plot? Can you name me a movie with intrigue as a major aspect that DIDN'T have a complex, twisting plot? I can't!
Okay, I will give you wooden acting in some parts, especially the fellow playing Jango Fett. But Hayden Christiansen? The kid exudes a very good Holden Caulfield-y vibe, but with enough respect for his elders to keep you from calling him a whiny brat. Every male teen goes through this stage, some worse than others, and I think Christiansen handled this better than most young actors would.
The visuals actually OUTCLASS ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Phantom Menace"": the ""Blade Runner""-like details of planet Coruscant; the adventure in the droid factory; the battle on Tatooine...there are entirely too many great visual moments in the movie to mention. Is there something wrong with that? Need I remind you that it takes TONS of man-hours to program CGI software to get things just right to produce such visual and idiosyncratic realism, and that the actors often have to react to things that aren't even there? People like you and AMPAS ought to realize just what acting chops go into making a good sci-fi movie a good sci-fi movie. And make no mistake, this is one of the best science fiction movies ever made!
Until you bozos can produce something on this level yourself, I'll thank you not to discourage people who may have not seen it, but would probably enjoy it if it weren't for a pretentious bunch of geeks trying to sound like Ebert and Roeper in picking apart a clearly superior piece of filmmaking. I might add that Roger Ebert never produced a good movie script in his life!
It's not COMPLETELY perfect, however, as even (( I )) have some problems with some plot points, for instance:
The death of Schmi Skywalker. Why was this just tossed off like somebody walking to the corner. Why was she kidnapped? Was the Federation behind it? Dooku? Or were the Sand People working alone? Her husband seemed to be pretty offhand about it, didn't he?
Why wasn't Annakin allowed to go back for Padme after she fell out of the transport unit? She was an important part of the team and I'm sure if Obi Wan or Annakin had been in the same spot, they would have expected to be saved by the others....The other personnel tranports could have pursued and CAPTURED Dooku without them! Strange!
How in the BLOODY hell are we supposed to accept Jar Jar Binks as a senator from Naboo?? Why didn't they send Boss Nass if they wanted to recruit from the Gungans??
And somebody PLEASE tell Lucas to get rid of freaking C3PO! He adds NOTHING to the movies....NOTHING!
Anyway....buy this movie, people, and you TOO can wonder why those home scenes with Padme and Annakin weren't left in the movie! (The scene revolving around the doomed young aliens in the wall pictures is quite touching.)
Highly recommended!"

257,4.0,So funny and I freaking love the song HEY BROTHER LOL
258,4.0,Very funny and action packed. Eddie Griffith is freaking hilarious.
259,1.0,"There are movies that make you feel dirty and miserable, because there is simply nothing there to like -- not characters, plot or even a good feeling.

One good example: ""Hollow Man,"" the loosest possible adaptation of H.G. Wells' classic novel ""The Invisible Man""... except that instead of one stupid scientist, we have a whole cast of them. Gratuitous animal-abuse, rape, some great special effects and a despicable cast of annoying characters... well, it's easy to see why Paul Verhoeven hasn't made an American movie since, even if it was very profitable.

A bunch of scientists are working on an invisibility formula for the military, led by the arrogant Sebastian Caine (Kevin Bacon). When they successfully return a gorilla to visibility (almost killing it in the process), Sebastian decides that it's time for human trials -- and secretly has the team inject HIM with the serum. All seems to be going well... until the reversion therapy fails. Sebastian is stuck until his team finds a cure.

And unfortunately, the serum seems to be making him cruel, violent and psychotic -- he uses his invisibility to spy on his increasingly paranoid team, including his ex-girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue) and her new boyfriend. And to stop the team from warning the military about the danger he poses, he's willing to trap and kill them one by one...

""The Hollow Man"" is the loosest possible interpretation of ""The Invisible Man"" -- the only thing that connects them is an invisibility serum that makes you crazy and evil. But while there was only ONE scientist doing stupid things in H.G. Wells' story, this movie has SEVERAL scientists doing stupid things. A lot of stupid things.

I will say this: the special effects are spectacular, particularly the process of both Sebastian and the gorilla turning invisible and visible again. Almost fifteen years later, they still hold up beautifully -- the dissolves of skin, muscles, veins and bones are almost grotesque in their realism.

Here's what's wrong: EVERYTHING ELSE. The plot is entirely dependent on people doing idiotic things -- the entire premise is that these scientists stupidly decided to secretly start human testing because... well, because Sebastian wants too. No better reason. It's riddled with a thousand tiny holes (a gorilla hits a guy and he doesn't even get bruised!), and the dialogue drips with sleaze. There are a few amusing moments (Sebastian freaking out some kids with his ""hollow"" face), but the rest of the movie taints them.

It's also painfully obvious from the beginning that Sebastian is going to immediately go evil and develop a god complex. But since Verhoeven is not known for his subtlety, this is expressed by him beating animals to death and making comments so obviously psychopathic that I'm surprised he didn't go ""Mwahahahahaha!"" at the end of every sentence.

And there's an ugly streak of misogyny that runs through the movie like a stream of fetid excrement -- and the brutal rape scene is only the most obvious example, especially since we never see that poor woman again. She is literally there just to be leered at and raped. If it were just Sebastian, that would be okay, but the hostile yet voyeuristic attitude seems to permeate the entire film.

I think it's the movie's intention to make us hate Sebastian, which is a massive mistake -- Kevin Bacon is easily a good enough actor to bring dimension to the arrogant, callous Sebastian, and evoke some kind of sympathy for him. We should feel somewhat sorry for a man going mad. Except Verhoeven makes you hate him from the beginning, and makes it clear that there is no good in this man, so he ends up basically being a less witty, less visible Freddy Krueger.

The sad thing is that the primary concept of ""Hollow Man"" is a good one, but the ugly, sleazy way it's presented just squanders it. Even Kevin Bacon can't save this turkey."
260,2.0,"Hollow Man was a film that got plenty of commercial time.  I remember its previews, and to be honest, it looked appealing.  Ah, but looks can be deceiving.  It looked like a pretty fascinating horror movie, worth seeing, that maybe it would have some depth and avoid the cheezy mistakes of past horror flicks.  The idea of an invisable man, creating havoc, intrigued me.  So I saw it.  My analysis is that this is a huge disappointment.  The ultimate let down when it comes to potential.
Kevin Bacon is a fine actor, I like him, I really do.  He makes a good hero and villain, and in this one he plays the villain.  He plays Dr. Caine, who turns out to be this reckless, arrogant mad scientist who breaks rules to break ground.  Fine, this is a good character that we can follow.  His ultimate dream, project if you will, is to create invisibility.  So after many animal experiments, he decides to test it, with him as the guinea pig.  Well it works, he's invisible, but he can't change back.  And as it turns out, he doesn't want to.
This is good, but where the potential is dropped is when Sebastian Caine goes berserk.  There really is no reason established in this movie why he suddenly turns to evil and does these murderous, mischievous deeds.  The question ""why"" kept popping into my head during this movie.  I suppose it could be answered that he loved the power of invisibility and never wanted to share it or give it up to anyone else.  Or his envy and jealousy got the better of him.  But this didn't work for me, there needed to be a better reason on why he snapped.
Elisabeth Shue was Sebastian's girlfriend, now is his best buddy's girlfriend, which is where the envy and jealousy comes from.  What I felt would've been better to create the motive was not have the movie start out with Shue being the ex to Sebastian but to have them still be together.  Then have her dump him for the better man.  Soap operish, I know, but at least it gives us a better motive.
Well, you already know the plot, he goes berserk towards the second half of the film.  He molests some pretty young woman in her apartment, then becomes aggressive with Shue, he's rude and utterly evil.  Then he decides he's sick of everyone and he's going to kill them all.  So one by one he hunts each of the team members who work on his project down.  Again, this all came on suddenly.  This film lacks understandment to why Sebastian mutated from this over zealous scientiest into this demonic madman.  He just turns with no real motive.  The plot would be fine if it just gives us a clear and definate reason to why Sebastian turns into this villain.
I thought the special effects were OK, maybe a bit over done.  When he starts becoming invisible, we see his muscles and then his skeleton as he's transforming.  This didn't look very real, it is so clearly recognizable as computer generated effects.  It looked more cartoon like and therefore I wasn't very impressed with the transformation.  I did like it whenever somebody threw something on him to visualize him.  That seemed real and quite believable.
But you know what bugged me the most about this movie?  Despite the sudden switch in Sebastian, despite the failure of potential to enhance the plot, the real issue with this movie is that it's just like all the other corny horror movies out there.  It's got the corny lines, the cheap suspense, the typical ending, and the typical ""take forever to die monster"" formula.
I mean come on, how many horror movies have we seen where it takes forever for the bad guy to die?  First Shue torches him with a blow torch, practically reducing him to standing ash.  But yet, he's as strong as ever and still alive and still standing!  No freaking way!  Then he gets electrocuted and yet he's still alive and strong as ever!  Then he climbs up a ladder, all burnt and fried, trying to get Shue only to get torched again this time for good.  I mean, how corny.  Just die, man.
If this movie had ended it with a more thought provoking, dramatic, maybe even sympathizing fashion we might appreciate this movie a whole lot more.  But because it had to end with cheese, this film does not separate itself from the 1950's ""screamers"" or the 1980's ""blood and guts"" horror flicks.  In the end, this film leaves us unsatisfied because I think most of us saw the potential for this movie, but the director stupidely turns it into a horror movie that we can see any time we want on the USA channel.  Which after only three years old, that is Hollow Man's new home...the TV.  What a hollow movie.
Grade: C-"
261,3.0,"SINGLE WHITE FEMALE is a highly suspenseful movie about an unfortunate young woman's psychological breakdown, or it's a glossy slasher movie starring two of Hollywood's best young actresses or maybe it's both at the same time--or perhaps it's the clever and well-acted thriller for its first hour before resorting to the routine shocks of a cheap horror flick.

However you look at it, there's no denying that this is a dynamite showcase for Jennifer Jason Leigh as the roommate from hell who becomes the bane of Bridget Fonda's existence. First she picks up Fonda's mannerisms, then starts to borrow her wardrobe, cuts her hair to resemble Fonda's, and even ""borrows"" her roomie's boyfriend(Steven Weber) for a deceitful night of lovemaking.

By that point Fonda's totally freaking out (wouldn't you?), and, well, that's when the whole thing gets a little too silly. Still, this is a nifty little shocker, and director Barbet Schroeder brings more intelligence and style to the material than it really deserves. Add that to the fine performances by the battling roommates and you've got a movie that will make you think twice before inviting total strangers to live with you.

From there on, things simply continue to go from bad to worse when Allie's new roommate wants to borrow a few things-like her clothes, her boyfriend and her life.

This suspense flick takes me back to memory lane to when I was 19 going on 20 years old in my Sophomore year in college when it was theatrically released in the Summer of 1992 when George Bush, Sr. was president & we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1992-1993."
262,5.0,"A very 60's film, and acting like you will never see from anyone in today's films.  You'll love the look of the sets, the clothes, everything... because back then movies were less artificial.  This film is art. It's eccentric and dark. Its great.  SOMEONE NEEDS TO RELEASE IT TO DVD. No one should hold this film back from DVD format. Same with the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton film titled ""Boom"".  These are gems. Release them to the public as DVD's, ok ???!! Right now,only option is to get the VHS copied to DVD...so do that because this film is worth it especially if you are an Elizabeth Taylor fan who wants to see how great she could be away from the boring usual ""good girl"" roles. Mia Farrow was also perfect in this.  You can get VHS tapes copied to DVD, look it up.  Or get a VHS player. I also HIGHLY recommend the disturbing but brilliantly acted  Elizabeth Taylor film ""The Driver's Seat"".
Elizabeth is a freaking genius who makes it look easy."
263,2.0,"WARNING:  Contains spoilers.

I'll come out and admit it -- I'm not a huge romance fan.  I don't mind a romance being part of a larger story, but I don't watch many actual romance films.  They tend to be too sappy, maudlin, and boring for my tastes.  There are exceptions -- I love ""Ever After,"" ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"" ""The Wedding Singer,"" and ""Runaway Bride"" -- but often because there's a clever story or humor accompanying the romance.  If a movie has nothing else to offer aside from two people falling in love and making goo-goo eyes at each other, I'm bound to tune out.  But a relative recommended ""Somewhere in Time"" to me, and upon discovering that the central premise hinged on time travel, I bit.  If the romance turned out to be boring, I could at least enjoy time-travel shenanigans, right?

Sadly, this film has nothing to offer a non-romance fan, and precious little even for romance fans.  It's dull, contains a number of plot holes, and will disappoint anyone excepting there to be some actual logic behind the time travel elements.

""Somewhere in Time"" follows Richard Collier, a playwright living in 1980s Chicago and suffering from both depression and a bad case of writer's block.  Recalling a memorable encounter years ago with an old woman who gave him a pocket watch and pleaded for him to ""come back to me,"" he checks into the Grand Hotel, an old hotel on Lake Michigan, and discovers photographs of a beautiful actress named Elise McKenna... the same woman who gave him the watch.  He pieces together her life story, and upon discovering a book about time travel in her personal effects -- and his signature, dated 1912, in the hotel's register -- he decides he's going to take the plunge and travel back in time to 1912 to be with Elise.  The two quickly hit it off... but Elise's manager wants to see her become a star and not be tied down by a romance, and he'll do whatever he can to get between the two.

Time travel stories are typically full of paradoxes and time loops, and have to handwave whatever technology or anomaly is being used to go backward or forward in time.  ""Somewhere in Time"" is worse than most, however.  How is it that Elise knew Richard was coming when they'd never met before 1912?  If Elise gave younger Richard the pocket watch, and he in turn gave it to her in 1912 for her to give back to him, where did the freaking watch come from?  And the method of time travel used -- self-hypnosis -- is ridiculous.  So basically Richard goes from 1980 to 1912 just by wishing really hard?  I suppose the method of time travel wasn't considered important to a romance story, but I would have appreciated some actual effort beyond ""wishing yourself back in time.""

The acting in this film is pretty wooden.  I understand that Christopher Reeve was a celebrated actor, one who would later gain a sort of immortality by playing Superman, but he's stiff and dull in this film.  Jane Seymour is little more than a pretty face, putting little effort into her lines or performance.  Christopher Plummer, while another highly respected actor, seems wasted here.

The saving grace of this movie is that the location is beautiful, and it does capture the feel of three different time periods ('70s, early '80s, and '10s) quite well.  I understand the Grand Hotel is an actual place, and that it saw an upsurge in popularity after this film came out.  That's good for the hotel, but it's unfortunate that such a lackluster film is attached to it.

Perhaps this film has its own fans, but I personally found it boring.  And if you like time travel movies at all, this one will only bore and annoy you."
264,5.0,"This movie is really funny. Kinda like the 1980s teen sex romps like ""Porkys"" ""Fast Times"" ect. The Humor is dirty raunchy perverted and tasteless. Thankfully all so called political correctness goes flying out the window and no where in sight for this movie. There is too much political correctness being forced upon us. It is very 80s. Take the shower scene all i will say is double your pleasure. For anyone who thought the shower scene in Porkys was hot. You ain't seen nothing til you seen this shower scene. Only problem i have is NO EXTRAS such as NO Featuretes of any kind..
  Now to the main reason behind this movie. THE GIRLS.ALL are the HOTTEST SchOOlgirlS you have ever seen in a movie..And nice coz all of the actresses are really in their 20s and near round 30 but can easily pass as teenagers..Which is good for those of us that are older then 18..Coz we can get HOT watching them and not feel guilty..A Guilty Pleasure INdeed..And when it comes to one of the schOOlgirls named Cherie (we call her ""Cherry"":) Clayman..Wonderfully Innocentally Flirtfully Played by Actress Keri Lynn Pratt...I challage any red blooded straight guy to watch this and not get HOT watching her..She is sooo HOT that i find it Very Hard to stay withIN the amazon.com review guidelines but i respect them so i control myself here. But take my word for it she is my fantasy and totally HOT and steals every scene that she is in. Not only is she sexy but she is hilarious..Wish see more of her in this movie and in other projects..When you see this movie you will know what i mean by saying i never wished i was a horse but now i do..And the ending scene in the back of limo did this actor get paid for this?? I would have done it FOR FREE..Hint Hint Hint..Song ""Good Morning Little SchOOlgirl"" comes to my mind when i think of and see Her. Ok with that i think i stayed in the guidelines good enough but believe me it was HARD..LoL..Get this movie & enjoy it..Also check out at amazon.com you can also buy a set with both movies..Buy it that way if you don't already have one..(BuFFy SarahMichelle is in the first one:) And enjoy the HOTTEST Little SchOOlgirls that any guy would freaking die for..Every man's fantasy..But remember ""Cherry/Cherry"" is MINE MINE MINE!!!!!! LoL :) :P"
265,2.0,"Very poorly organized. Madison said on several occasions that things happened in rooms she entered but there was no camera in the room to record it. Cameras should have been set up in every room. I found the two girls very irritating , freaking out and causing mass hysteria over little things such as a noise. What did they expect investigating a haunted house ? Silence ? Use of the ouija board is stupid if the ghosts can't spell and the questions were ridiculous and non-specific. EVP's should have been recorded. What's the point in using an EMF detector when one can feel the temperature in a room and/or temperature changes. Madison was very annoying with her repeated cleansing rituals, I mean once is enough. She wouldn't even allow the others to eat because she wanted to perform another ritual ! She's no more a psychic than Donald Trump is ! A real psychic would have received visions of the history of the house, names and messages from the spirits. Plus if she's so claustrophobic, why bother participating in the event ? All the action happened at the end and not throughout. Disappointing."
266,4.0,"Joss Whedon, the writer, really shined in this, his best television series, with a great deal of talent and effort.  Though not the best season of Buffy, it has many endearing qualities that evolved to perfection in future seasons to a culmination in season three.  However, if you want to know the background of the characters, as well as see how this widely praised series has its roots, check this out.  The dialog alone is worth the price.  You won't get enough of the trendy phrases that, believe it or not, were invented by the writers and were not gathered by hanging out at local high schools.  And finally, get a look at Willow in those freaking leggings."
267,5.0,Angelina Jolie is freaking great in this film Nicolas Cage is at the top of his game here this movie is an Adrenaline rush the movie is great the acting is fantastic the action is even better definite buy.
268,5.0,"I will probably get stoned for this, but this Wrestlemania was not as good as everyone has made it out to be. WM X-8 was so much better, despite the calibur of the main event...X-7 has a bett main event by far...

Match #1 Chris Jericho (c) vs. Commisioner Regal for the IC Championship: Boring! But I can see why they'd open the show with this. Jericho retains his title, but why would Regal win if he was the commisioner anyways? 5/10

Match #2 Tazz & APA vs. Right to Censor: This could have been better if it was longer, but it was way too short. Tazz and Farooq barely got any ring time. Bradshaw beat RTC around a little bit, clothesline from hell, and that was that. Tazz and APA win. 6/10

Match #3 Raven (c) vs. Big Show vs. Kane for the Hardcore Championship: Not bad, but could have been better. What was lame about this match was that Raven didn't stand a chance against these two so everyone knew he would lose. Kane wins after throwing Show and Raven off the stage, then dropping a SICK leg drop on Show and pinning him! 7.5/10

Match #4 Eddie Guererro vs. Test (c) for the European Championship: One of the worst matches on the card. This match makes me wonder why no one liked Eddie back then and why everyone is all over his nuts now! He acts exactly the same! The crowd was so dead for this match it was crazy! Eddie wins with Malenko and Saturn's help and Test looked weak barely getting any offense in! STINK! 3/10

Match #5 Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle: Best match of the card so far! First match in these twos long history of matches. It was a great display of pure mat wrestling, but again not as good as everyone said it was. Their match at Royal Rumble '03 whipes the floor with this match. Angle wins with a hand full of tights! 8/10

Match #6 Ivory (c) vs. Chyna for the Woman's Championship: I was actually entertained by this eventhough it ended in like 2 or 3 minutes. Chyna pummeled Ivory all over the place and easily took her title. Not a good night for Right to Censor...Thank God!!! 7/10

Match #7 Vince McMahon vs. Shane McMahon in a Street Fight: Is it just me or is Shane like the king of street fights?! This was entertaining because of the drama behind it, not the actual match. There was no blood what so ever, but 2 sick bumps made up for it...Shane's leap of faith through the announce table and Shane doing a drop kick all the way across the ring planting a garbage can into Vince's face...oh and Linda punting Vince in the grapefruits! Mick Foley was SGR! Shane wins! 8.5/10

Match #8 E & C vs. The Hardyz vs. The Dudleyz (c) for the Tag Team Championships TLC 2: Another entertaining match, but not as good as their first triangle ladder match. What made this not as good was the constant interference by everyone...Rhyno, Spike, and Lita! Some cool spots...Spike gives Christian the Dudley Dog through a table, Rhyno gores Matt through a table, and the Dudleyz give Lita the 3D! Rhyno pushes Christian up the ladder allowing E&C to win the belts! 8.5/10

Match #9 Gimmick Battle Royal: This sucked! Worst match on the card! All these old timers who obviously couldn't wrestle anymore were in the ring and it just looked like the inside of a toilet bowl...crap! Iron Sheik wins this garbage in like 2 1/2 minutes! The entrances for everyone took like 4 times as long as the match...0/10

Match #10 HHH vs. Taker: Now we are getting somewhere! After taker flattened Mike Chioda, this turned into a street fight going all over the place! HHH took a 15' chokeslam, SICK! Taker wins with the last ride after HHH busted him open with the sledgehammer! AWESOME! 10/10

Match #11 Rock (c) vs. Austin for the WWF Title: Save the best for last, that's what I always say! This was announced as a No DQ match right when the superstars were making their entrances to the ring! Rock was getting his butt handed to him by the Rattlesnake at the beginning of this match and was busted open early! Stone Cold sells his soul to the devil, as McMahon gives Austin a chair and he DESTROYS Rock with the dang thing! The alliance we never thought we'd see was formed, Vince and Austin! After their victory, they celebrate with some beers as WM X-7 comes to a close...freaking CRAZYNESS!!! 10000000000/10

Overall not bad, but like I said see WM X-8 cuz it's better then this! Austin vs. Rock is probably the only thing that makes this mania better then X-8 because we know HHH vs. Jericho sucked! Oh and I'm a big fan of Paul Heyman, but he proved at how much he sucks at being an announcer here...his commentary was HORRIBLE! Too bad King was gone for this..."
269,1.0,I'd give it zero if I could. This movie is freaking terrible.
270,4.0,1980's insider trading freaking cool
271,5.0,"Back in the 1980's, when I was in Elementary School, I saw my very first horror movie, Nightmare on Elm Street part 4. After that, I didn't see another horror movie until Middle School in the early 90's, I saw Friday The 13th part 7. After seeing Friday the 13th, I started really liking horror movies and started watching everything from Stephen King, every Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th, a lot more that aren't so popular and of course the Halloween movies. I was able to watch horror movies for years and years without being affected really. It was to the point that some horror movies were just putting me to sleep because they weren't scary. That is, until I saw The Ring and The Ring Two!

I saw The Ring in the theatre and from that first time, it scared me to death. I literally jumped during many scenes and after it was over, it wasn't really over for me. That night after I got back home, I couldn't sleep with the light off. I didn't want to see any static on my TV because I was so scared. My friend who I saw it with kept mentioning a static TV just to scare me and it worked. I have also had a few nightmares about Samara coming after me since I saw The Ring and especially, The Ring Two. The scariest thing that has happened to me was right after I saw The Ring Two in the theatre and that evening after I fell asleep, I swear I heard Samara speaking to me!! I swear it!!! It was her same voice that you hear in The Ring and it was like she was talking right in my ear!! The only thing I actually heard her say was the very first thing and very last thing she said. I heard her talking for a while but everything in the middle, I just didn't understand because it was like I was half awake and half asleep. All I was able to hear her say was ""I never sleep because I'm not dead yet"" and the very last thing she said was ""wake up."" After this happened, I decided to get rid of The Ring DVD, Rings DVD and not even buy The Ring Two because apparently, these films are going to just scare me to where I'll be terrified for the rest of my life!!

You know that saying, be careful what you wish for because you might just get it? Well I got a lot more than I wished for all right!!! For years before The Ring came out, I was wishing for a horror movie that would really scare me and this movie scaring me is an understatement!! I never wanted to be scared so bad by having nightmares!! Just the other day, I was watching The Travel Channel and there was this show on about different haunted places and this one mansion was built by an Opera singer who used to perform in her house to people and I thought it was interesting and it didn't scare me in the least UNTIL they had to show the Opera singer's ghost and the ghost looked EXACTLY like Samara, had her long black hair over her face like Samara and she started walking toward the camera which meant, towards me as well. For a second I was freaking out thinking she was going to come out of the TV!!! Before she got too close, I covered my eyes and then they showed another part in the mansion and I just changed the channel!! I think the part that freaks me out the most is when Samara is out of the well and coming toward the TV and in The Ring Two when you see her climbing the well, that creepy way she climbs the well!! For some reason, I cannot get those visions out of my head!!! So to say this movie is still affecting me to this day is a HUGE understatement!!! The thing I just cannot understand is WHY any other horror movie just either puts me to sleep or just wonderful to watch because of the acting or just cool to watch?? I'll NEVER understand what it is about Samara and The Ring and The Ring Two that just terrifies me!! Maybe it's the static TV and the fear of Samara actually coming out of the TV!"
272,2.0,"""The Ring"" is yet another in a long line of movies that just can't live up to it's own hype. Hearing stories about people freaking out in theaters and odd things happening at home during viewings made me think I was in for one hell of a thrill. Despite the fact that I had my own eerie experience while watching this -- my phone started ringing at exactly the same time as the phone in the opening scene -- I still couldn't feel any intensity, any chills, or any entertainment. I don't ask much of my horror movies, not much at all, they don't have to be scary or full of gore (afterall, this is the guy who LIKED ""Open Water""), just as long as I can make some sort of connection and they entertain me for the 90+ minutes they run in. ""The Ring"" doesn't do that. Instead, we are subjected to a very good looking, but pretentious picture as done by ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" (another movie that had way too much hype) director, Gore Virbinski. Virbinski is no doubt a skilled director, but there is just too much eye candy here, as opposed to actual plot. Not for one minute did I really feel any characters were in danger, and the pace just kept going up and down so much that it just got annoying. Each time I would start to engage myself in the happenings, the movie would just let go of me. The overall story leaves much to be desired, and the ending makes absolutely no sense. I honestly don't understand how this movie could become such a phenomenom. Maybe it's just me. I know I need something a little more visceral to scare me or at least entertain me. ""The Ring"" is just a whole lotta nothing. There is one scene where a horse commits suicide that might arouse the sleepy haze that will most likely come over you, but it really has no other purpose to the story, and much like everything else in the movie, it was put there just to make you uncomfortable (it made me giggle uncontrollably). Towards the end of the movie, my dog barfed up a considerably large amount of food on my bed. Now that, my friends, is scary."
273,4.0,"""The Ring"" opens with a scene that looks exactly like the opening scene of every slasher movie. Two teenage girls are at home alone, watching TV; one of them brings up a rumor about a cursed videotape that kills you seven days after you watch it; the other girl goes pale and reveals that she saw a weird videotape a week ago; etc. The scene moves along a familiar arc -- creepy sounds, a couple false alarms, and finally a violent death. However, it does not end with a psychopath jumping out of a closet, but with a fleeting glimpse of a grainy image on the victim's TV screen. And right away the movie has our interest, because we're wondering, ""What did we just see, and why did it literally scare her to death?""
We meet the dead girl's aunt, Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts), a harried reporter/single mom who begins investigating this supposed killer videotape. Her search leads her to a campground in the mountains, where she does indeed find a mysterious unmarked cassette. She watches it; it is filled with strange images such as a shimmering ring of light, a ladder, a woman falling off a cliff, severed fingers, etc. Then the phone rings, and a whispered voice tells her she has seven days to live.
With the clock ticking, Rachel races to uncover the mystery of the tape. Who made it, and how? Who is the strange woman who appears on the tape? In her hunt for answers, Rachel enlists the help of her ex, Noah (Martin Henderson), a computer geek who spouts techo-jargon and ominously informs her, ""This tape has no data code. That's like a person born without fingerprints."" There's also her little son, Aidan (David Dorfman), who begins drawing some rather disturbing pictures. Rachel has frightening dreams. Images from the tape appear in the real world. The clues lead her to a windswept island where some unpleasant deeds were done in the past, and from there.....well, I shouldn't reveal much more of the plot.
""The Ring"" is not very original. It has all the standard elements of a supernatural thriller. Spontaneous nosebleeds? Check. A gloomy psychiatric ward? Check. A pseudo-psychic little kid? Yup. Water leaking from nowhere? Half-glimpsed figures? Sudden, chilling revelations? Animals freaking out for no reason? Creaking floorboards? They're all there. Where ""The Ring"" succeeds is in its central mystery, its muted atmosphere, its unsettling soundtrack, and some genuinely scary moments that -- for once -- don't rely on a sudden shock. The most frightening scene comes at the end, when we learn exactly how an image on a TV screen can scare someone to death. The scene happens in broad, stark daylight, and instead of trying to startle the audience, it moves with a steady, relentless pace, getting more terrifying by the second, until......well, this is horror at its most potent, and it makes up for the film's shortcomings.
Naomi Watts has real star power, as evidenced by the arc of her movie career. (from ""Children of the Corn 5"" to an Oscar nom!) Here, she brings sympathy and desperation to her somewhat sparse character, and also proves she can scream really well. Martin Henderson is likable, even though his character is left by the wayside. David Dorfman does a nice job as the kid, even though he's an obvious rip-off of Haley Joel Osment. Brian Cox has an effective cameo as a reclusive old man, and Daveigh Chase, that sweet-voiced little girl from ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Lilo & Stitch,"" is uncredited in a crucial role that horror movie buffs will be talking about for years to come.
""The Ring"" is based strongly on a popular Japanese horror film that, according to most sources, is even better. I will see it in due time. For now, I'll just give thanks to this American film for scaring my pants off. If ever there was an excuse to switch to DVD...."
274,5.0,"I, for the first time, saw this film this weekend and I have to say that it was truley terrifying.  They just don't make horror films like this anymore.  It's very hard to find a film that chills your bones and gets under your skin like The Shining does, and it's equaly hard to find a villian who haunts you long after you've seen the film like Jack does.  Jack Nicholson nailed this performance with conviction and pure insanity, you could really be afraid of this man.  My only complaint it the overly obnoxious acting on the part of Shelley Duvall who played Jack's wife.  She was really annoying.  Danny Lloyd who played the son Danny (it's funny how both Jack and Danny play charactors named Jack and Danny) was frightening.  I rest my case, little kids are creepy as hell.  The whole redrum scene where he's in his mothers room and he's repeating 'redrum' over and over in this demonic voice, I was cringing...It was so nerveracking.  That poor woman...no matter how annoying she was, she had to deal with a crazy husband weilding an ax and a crazy psychic son.  The scene where she locks Jack in the storage room and he's pleading with her to let him out...where he was like ""you hurt my head real bad"" I mean, that was acting genious.  This film proved what people have been saying forever...Jack Nicholson is a freaking legend.  Watch this film.  While it may not follow the book to a T Kubrick is a cinimatic master and with Nicholson as his main attraction with is a show worth it's weight in gold."
275,5.0,"Will anyone ever forget the phrase ""All work and no play make Jack a dull boy""? It should have been, ""All thrills and no faithfulness to the novel make Stephen a pissed author.""

Kubrick's expert crafting of shocker-films has been well known for years; we know this from 'Clockwork Orange,' already. But as far as book ADAPTATIONS, ""The Shining"" is a failure. This is not to say, however, that ""Shining"" is a poorly made FILM.

First off, the sets and location for the Overlook Hotel could not have made more perfect marks on the scare-scale. Particularly the scene (which will definitely turn your insides) where Jack ventures into the mystery room, and meets the hag in the bathtub, is brilliantly suspenseful. Climactic moments that rely on the sets are the maze chase between Jack and his PSI-cursed son, and the corresponing sub-scene where Duvall becomes lost in the haunted manor and encounters the infamous elevator lobby. FYI, the Overlook's snowbound exteriors were filmed on location in an actual Colarado residence. Interiors, however, were constructed sound-sets.

What Scatman Crothers was doing in a flick like this is beyond me, but Nicholson and Duvall along with the undercredited son Lloyd, show true talent, and dish out the chills and thrills with the slight of a stroke of lipstick (((REDRUM))).

Nicholson's hacking of the bathroom door with his axe is one of the most memorable cinematic moments brought to the big-screen,(""HEEEEERRRE'S JOHNNY!"") and audiences everywhere are still screaming.

Finally, one can thank the gore department for keeping in balane with the plotline. Moments to watch for here, folks, are Danny's delusional trike ride down the hotel corridors, the bathtub scene, and of course, the death of Crothers' character.

If you don't jump out of your seat to go throw up, you'll at least get some serious goosebumps and chills. Kubrick's knack with freaking us out was alive then, and isn't dead yet.

As for the bad news, Stephen King fans will abandon the feature before the first twenty minutes. 'Carrie' holds truer to it's book than this one. But whoever said book-to-movie projects were easy, guys? Give Stan a break, please. The plotline is of course, dramatically simplified, but that's half the fun. Those who haven't read the novel--like myself--probably won't throw thier popcorn at the TV as hard as King-fanatics may.

Like I said, it'll scare the living hell out of it's viewer, maybe even cause you hide all sharp objects from your hubby for safety. If your like classic nightmare-inducing thrillers, and enjoy the talent of Jack Nicholson, you've met your match. Get it, Wendy?!

Saw it, loved it, now I own it,

276,3.0,"Mikel Conrad, who appeared uncredited in a number of films through the late 40's and early 50's, not only starred in The Flying Saucer (1950), but also is listed as the writer, director, and producer.  One may also have seen Mr. Conrad (in rare credited roles) in films like Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff (1949) and Francis the Talking Mule (1950).
First of all, let me say right off the bat that while there is a flying saucer in this film, it's not from outer space, and there are no spacemen bent on world domination or coming to steal out women for weird procreation experiments anywhere in this film.  The flying saucer is a plot device in the movie, but the whole science fiction angle to the story is pretty much non-existent.  Just fair warning to anyone looking for a little cheesy science fiction fun from the 50's.
The movie starts off with a flying saucer zipping around the air, freaking people out, and newspaper headlines scream of its' appearance.  Various world governments (well, the only two that counted at that time, us and Big Red) have taken an interest in this amazingly fast aircraft, and are seeking it out.  The thought being that one could drop atomic bombs anywhere, anytime, unfettered.  Should the Red Menace get their hands on this, well...remember, this was 1950 and the Cold War was in full swing.  Mikel Conrad is Mike Trent, a millionaire playboy and government spy... well, I am unsure if he was an actual agent or just got recruited in the movie, but either way...you see, there seems to be a good amount of activity in Alaska concerning the Russians, and since Mike Trent's family has diversified interests there, goldmines, logging camps, beaver farms, igloo construction, the United States government thought he would make the perfect agent to send in and see what's going on...under the premise that he had a nervous breakdown and is going home to recuperate.  At his side is Vee Langley (played by Pat Garrison), another government agent posing as Mike's nurse.  (Actually, the only actor you may recognize in here is Denver Pyle, who was on TV's Dukes of Hazzard as Uncle Jesse.  Pyle plays a Communista goon...I think...he didn't get a lot of screen time).
So Mike and Vee are traveling by boat to a hunting lodge owned by Mike's family, and we get to see a whole lot of beautiful Alaskan scenery.  We also get to see Mike smoke like a chimney.  I swear, the first half of this film you couldn't go five minutes without seeing Mike light up another cigarette.  We also get voiceover from Mike, telling us a little about the beautiful scenery, but, I have to say, it was kind of difficult to listen to Mike expound on the loveliness of the surrounding Alaskan wilderness and then watch him pitch cigarette butts into the pristine, crystal clear Alaskan waters...but I digress.  They finally arrive at the near empty family hunting lodge and meet Hans, the caretaker.  Mike doesn't recognize Hans, and asks where the other caretaker is, to which Hans replies he doesn't know.  Plot point?  Probably...he certainly is a suspicious looking individual, and he seems to have a Frenchie accent and often wears a beret, sure signs of a no-goodnik.
Well, after some more goofy stuff, we do find out that the saucer is in the area, and the Russians are actively looking for it, with agents Mike and Vee right in the middle of the action...sort of...what's the big mystery of the flying saucer?  Will Mike and Vee be able to find it before the Stalingradians?  (Vee might, but I think Mike, aka Sir Smokes-A-Lot, will probably pass away of emphysema before the end of the film)
The Flying Saucer is basically a low-rent, James Bond spy movie without the cool gadgets or interesting characters.  The film gets points for using the Alaskan wilderness as a backdrop, but loses points for the pretty lame plot devices and even lamer dialogue.  I do admire Conrad's effort in writing, producing and directing this feature.  Independent filmmaking is always a sketchy business, so I have to cut him a little slack as he seemed to make the best of what he had, and this certainly didn't turn out all bad.
Wade Williams and Image Entertainment provide a pretty poor print for this release, one with obvious damage to the film throughout.  It's still watchable, but at a few points lines on the film are pretty heavy, and speckling severe.  The audio is comparatively better, but also suffers at a couple of points.  I wasn't surprised at the condition of the film, and I doubt Criterion has this on their list of future releases, so this is probably the best you're going to get on DVD.  Special features include a trailer for the film, and trailers for five other Wade Willams/Image releases.  I am giving this film three stars, two for the movie and one for the great looking scenery used in the film.  All in all, The Flying Saucer is a mildly entertaining Cold War relic, and, at the very least, I learned that if you are ever underneath a glacier, traveling along a passageway, do not fire a submachine gun.  You are only asking for trouble, my friend.

277,5.0,"Funny how time flies. Seems like it was just yesterday that most of us were freaking about Y2K (I seriously had nightmares after watching The Omega Code!). Now we're already a decade into the New Millenium. Alot has changed in that time so how about a trip down memory lane?

Originally aired as a one hour Christmas special on ABC in late 2000, My Reflection features a concert from then 19 year old pop songstress Christina Aguilera performing a mix of her early hits, nice covers, and a few Christmas songs. A short home movie clip of little Chrissy performing a spirited cover of Whitney Houston's Where Do Broken Hearts Go? at a talent show opens the set followed by a brief intro of the singer explaining why Christmas is one of her favorite times of the year.

The first half of the Mulan single Reflection is followed by enthusiastic renditions of a Middle Eastern flavored Genie in a Bottle, sassy Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You), and R&B tastic What a Girl Wants. Lil' Bow Wow (back when he was really really lil') jumps aboard for a slinky, jazzier sounding So Emotional before Christina takes back the spotlight with an impressive, at times oversung, take of Etta James' 1961 standard At Last and the choir assisted Climb Every Mountain from The Sound of Music. She also touches on her Latin roots with the smoky ballad Contigo en la Distancia (With You At A Distance) and fiery uptempo Falsas Esperanzas (False Expectations). Christmas tunes like the bluesy Merry Christmas, Baby with the legendary Dr. John, a soulful version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas with Brian McKnight, and another Bow Wow duet Christmas Time close the set.

Excerpts of Christina's MTV Diary special as well as a short behind the scenes look at the making of the Come On Over Baby music video pepper the concert. Extras include videos of Spanish versions of Genie in a Bottle (Genio Atrapado), I Turn to You (Por Siempre Tu), Come On Over (Ven Conmigo), and the video for The Christmas Song in English.

The nostalgia hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything from Christina's red streaked blond hair, Bratz doll inspired outfits, and slightly faux ""ghettofied"" accent (this was the beginning of her Xtina transition) made me chuckle. Some of the choreography and set-ups are cheesy, but this is decade old teen pop we're talkin' about. Pop My Reflection in if you're ever in need of a smile or a good time."
278,3.0,"...After the meal the Sticky was actually able to enjoy the Vanilla with it's weird plot lines and the Andrew Lloyd Webber acting by the Cruise.  After all, with that type meal in the stomach, the Sticky could just close his eyes and imagine how great this movie could have been (as oppose to how freaking [bad] it was)."
279,5.0,I freaking love this movie. I've only seen it twice but 10yrs in between viewings didn't change the integrity of it. I don't own it in HD but I imagine it looks great. I highly recommend this to someone who loves independent foreign movies. 5 stars!
280,4.0,My wife has been wanting me to watch this movie for years. And I have to admit that this is freaking hilarious. I highly recommend this movie. WARNING: Must smoke first. LOL
281,5.0,I really can't say anything more about this movie other than what has already been said.  Just a freaking awesome movie!
282,5.0,"...I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re-release of these three films on DVD. A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again. Now I don't blame them. I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor. I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again. Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score.

In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they make a great buy. I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again. The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me. They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better. The only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc, you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie--which is really not a big deal. I highly recommend getting these to those that don't own them yet."
283,5.0,"...I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re-release of these three films on DVD. A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again. Now I don't blame them. I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor. I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again. Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score.

In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they make a great buy. I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again. The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me. They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better. The only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc, you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie--which is really not a big deal. I highly recommend getting these to those that don't own them yet."
284,4.0,"John Q deals with the plight of a couple whose only child needs a heart transplant.  The premise alone is the stuff that parent's nightmares are made of.  When the couple is told that they have no insurance coverage for this, because their insurance has been downgraded without their knowledge,  they do everything possible to raise the quarter of a million dollars needed for the transplant.  Appealing to the insurance company, filing for assistance from government aid organizations, selling all of their possesions, and the fundraising efforts of their community all fail to produce enough cash.  John's wife calls from the hospital with the news that their son is being released, that is, he is being sent home to die.  His wife demands that he does something.  So, John takes over a hospital emergency room, his only demand is that his son be placed on the list to recieve a heart.
Ok, so the movie gets predicatable.  John does a little freaking out, wins over the sympathies of his hostages and the news watching public, there is a bad cop and a good cop, and of course we are treated to a vain, exploitative TV news anchorman.  We are even forced to watch a little ""Universal Health Care"" propaganda near the end of the movie.  I even have to agree that the charges of some characters being stereo typical is true.  You know what?  I don't care.
The entire movie is emotionally compelling.  The story is quite believable, if not so much in the exact details of whether or not someone would be denied a transplant (some have claimed this would never happen, I personally believe that it can and does happen), then in the hell of paperwork and scheming that patients are put through by their healthcare organizations and governmental agencys.
The acting in this movie is absolutely superb.  Denzel Washington is at the top of his game and gives a commanding and believable performance.  I especially like when he was fumbling with the gun.  An ordinary father isn't going to be experienced at pulling a gun out of his trousers!  What an excellent touch!  Robert Duval and James Wood give their usual polished performances.  Ray Liotta is ok, if a little plastic.  Even the secondary characters, such as the video tech and the hostages were quite good.
The InfiniFilm version of the DVD has some very interesting extras that fans of small documentaries will enjoy."
285,5.0,"OK my thoughts on this movie
1. Battle sceans were fantastic
2. Most of the acting was incredible
3. Cinenatoraphy was excellent
4. A good book was ruined
Point 1-There comes a point in every movie going experience hwere you just have to bow down and thank god for computer generation.  If you thought the battle for Helms deep was cool wait until toy see the Battle of Palenor Fields(for those you that haven't read the books that's the battle in which the King of Rohan dies)
The army of the dead was a wonderful touch as well.  They get the award for best single moment in the entire series when you see these guys just pulling an elephant to the ground all on their own.
Overall the battle sceans are why you should see this movie if nothing else
Point two-Most of the actors were great it was great to see Viggo Mortensen's character(Aragorn) getting off the fence and deciding to embrace his destiny
Ian McKellen as always provides the central rallying point in his movie the Christ figure of this series he is able to rally the men of Gondor when all hope seems lost.  For a second there I actually felt that I was on the front lines with the men, it is a rare movie that can do that for me.
Orlando Bloom also kicks some major [rear].  The rational parts of my brain know that the fights have been chorigraphed heavily but whenever he fights it is like watching a ballet dancer.
John Rhys-Davies also provides a heartfelt and lovable, yet hammy performance as Gimli the dwarf
Most of the others proformed maviliously well however there are times when one must be realistic
Two things that ticked me off-The freaking melodrama and the fact that the hobbits(by which I mean Sam and Frodo) looked like they were going to cry half the time.
2 did not preform so well
Liv Tyler's performance is probably the most hyped in recent memory.  She is only in the movie for 20 flipping minutes I'm sorry I just don't get it.  I don't get the hype or the love interest or the stupid elven ballads that seem to erupt from her mouth without warning.
Elijah Wood in my humble opinion cannot act his way out of a wet paper bag.  I want to love this character but how can I do it with an actor like Elijah Wood?  If his acting does the job for you though please take no offense.
I will say this for every single one of the actors-They make you believe in the character weather or not the acting is good or bad.  I found myself rooting for Sean Austin especially
Point three-Cinematography
This will totally blow you away no it's and or buts about it.  It is as impressive as the great job that was done on ""Master and Commander""
Point four
I understand that a movie is a movie and a book is a book and I understand that there are time constants but to show the Hobbits going back to Hobbiton and having nothing change, no ravaging of the shire no final resolution of Saurman left a very big hole in the entire experience for me.  Oh well that's what deleted sceans are for."
286,4.0,"but matrix reloaded stands on its own.
it really deserves about 4.5 stars.
good movie with some awsome bullet time sequences and some really breath taking scenes.
only 2 problems for me in Matrix Reloaded was that some of the fight scenes are too long. when neo fights all 100+ agent smiths, it gets boring after a while.
that fight scene alone must have lasted a good 15-20 minutes.
also, i hate the ending, ""to be concluded""???? what was that? we're not watching some tv show here, this is the MATRIX!
on the upside, the bullet time here is just as good as in the original matrix. also, i absoultely LOVE the freeway car chase scene!!!
absoultey awsome! the music, the ghosts, the close calls with Trinity and the Keymaker on the mortacycle, and then the bullet time for the 2 eighteen wheeler crash is freaking AWSOME!!!
as for the DVD special features, it's worth it! big time! they go behind the scenes on the contrustion of the freeway sequence which began back in 2001! and it's not some 5 minute feature, it's a good feature that covers more than enough, and also helps the fans and viewers really understand not only how hard and how much work you have to do for just one sequence in a movie, but you come to appreciate the work the whole cast and crew did on matrix reloaded. WOW!!!"
287,5.0,"saw it on valentine's day. for the second time... decided that i really, really and i mean, <i>really</i> love this movie.
forget what i complained on my first review. this is just a damn good movie.
have decided that i can live with the ""artistic liberties"" jackson took with this movie. i mean, i guess i can live with the fact that movie-faramir is just totally different from book-faramir... i may not like it, but i can swallow that.
good gawd, i have to say that i <i>absolutely love</i> the fighting scenes in this one. man, it blew my mind away!!! it was just totally crazy and beautiful at the same time... i'm speechless really...
one of the best entrances yet has to be when gandalf and eomer arrived on the eastern side of the mountain on the fifth morning. stunning and breathtaking. gawd i love the scene where the riders descend from that frigging steep mountain side... *looks like stunned fish* just amazing...
and yes, this is definitely a movie for a girls' night out (or even v-day for singles like moi)... come on, there's like, what? nearly a half dozen of exceedingly beautiful male main characters? not to mention tons of other good enough to eat extras thrown in for good measure. you gotta be kidding me if that is not a good enough reason for girls to go see it... *grin*
but heck, this is way beyond anything i've seen before. and it's a darn good movie too. kudos to jackson for not letting down the hopes of the legions of fans... good news is that LotR: the return of the king promises to be even better.
the bad news is we have to wait for a freaking year for that one... i'm counting the days, man..."
288,1.0,"Last night I had the craziest dream ever, where someday a sci-fi/horror movie with aliens/creatures/what have you that pose a threat to people that DOESN'T think it's audience is dumb would be released someday.

My dream had happened sometime after I had seen Shamalamadingdong's second newest film, The Happening, where a toxin is released and people commit suicide. That film is guilty a thousand times over of assuming its audience is a group of dumbarses who believe every single bit of detail a movie tells them. Oh and let's not forget Shamalama's previous fiasco, The Village, which may be even worse for that. Except at least I liked the atmosphere of The Village.

The irony here is that both of the mentioned movies are directed by the same person who directed Signs. Okay, let's also take the time to observe the pattern- each movie got worse as it got along. What am I saying: This movie is logically the best one of that horror trilogy but that doesn't say much.

Here we have a family whose daddy was a preacher. Apparently he left the priesthood after his wife died yet he is still referred to as father. Bo, the girl, has a water problem, thd young brother has a problem with asthma, and the other brother... OK not sure since he isn't well developed. OK so looking past the priest problem, we have a strong start. They find a series of crop circles containing navigation signs, meaning there are aliens attacking them. Cool eh? Not when we find out some information about the aliens.

Before the big spoiler (Actually please do read this review before you see the movie because I'm about to save you time and/or money), let me explain a huge flaw: So they have a fancy UFO. And they walk around naked (I'll explain why that's a flaw after the jump). And they use crop circles as navigation signs. And they have a poison that sprays out of their wrists (that somehow only affects Bo...??????). And they make trilling noises. And they can run at breakneck speed (so can the middle child, despite having asthma).

But they can't break through wooden doors???? SERIOUSLY??? These strong aliens are apparently so evil but they can't break through doors????? They're strong enough to form giant crop circles in the cornfield but not strong enough to break through a freaking wooden door???

Well, here's the spoiler: They are affected by water.

Yeah, that's right. Water is their weakness.

How is that a problem?

-Now, the nudity problem. They can walk around naked and not be cold BUT THEY ARE AFFECTED BY WATER.

-And what about the one scene where it appears to be raining? Where do they hide?

Remember The Wizard of Oz? Yeah. I am calling this a ripoff of that movie. I'm surprised the aliens don't scream ""I'm MELTING! I'M MELTING!!!!!"".

Congratulations, M. Night Shamalimamachpichuperu. You have now just confirmed yourself as the biggest idiot in Hollywood, pendejo."
289,4.0,"I saw this movie in the theaters once when it first came out and I haden't seen it since that day until the other night. When I first saw Signs I was scared out of my mind. I couldn't do anything without thinking that some alien was outside of my roof or one was going to pop out from behind a tree in my backyard. I couldn't even stay calm watching it in the theater,I was so freaked out. Anyway a few days ago I decided I needed to cure myself of this fear of aliens that I have and get the sounds and faces of these aliens from Signs out of my head.(keep in mind that I'm 21 and I live alone...I get creeped out by my own shadow)So I watched the movie and in all honesty I can see why I was scared of the movie back then,it's not so much a scary,OMG,horror movie,it's more suspense,sci fi. This movie isn't showing aliens from begining to end and the aliens arn't killing and eating everyone. It's just suttle things that make you jump. You get chills before you even see the aliens,the fact that you know their there and you can't see them is the scary part. Finally I have gotten over the Signs curse and I'm ok watching the movie now. I'm not freaking out and honestly this is now one of my favorite Shyamalan movies. You have to see this movie."
290,1.0,This movie is horrible. Outright garbage! A film that is ridiculously simple - one man's loss and recovery of faith in God - somehow woven into a ridiculous plot with Aliens from planet wherever. Are you freaking kidding me? I want my money back. Top 10 worst movies I have ever seen. It should come with a warning that says ' You will be dumber after seeing this movie'.
291,1.0,"I've seen some lame movies, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen. This movie is just plain painful to watch start to finish. It's not even the type you can enjoy mocking, it's just plain bad. And to everyone who says ""You just don't get the message!""... believe me, I got it. Everyone who has been forced to watch this movie got it. The message is every bit as dull and predictable as the movie itself.
Every time the story even starts to get going, something so freaking stupid it makes my very brain ache happens. Have a touching moment about God vs Chance... follow it up with a story about a girl puking on herself. Yep, that's good cinema.
We have a family who are so dumb it's sad. No TV, it's evil. Don't ever talk to the girl who swears again, she's evil. Don't ever talk to any people from out of town, they're evil. Don't ever call anyone by anything but their full name, it's evil. Don't prey, it's evil... or something, he doesn't know. Got it? No? Cry about it now, because every 35 minutes there's gotta be a crying scene.
Now we get to the aliens. Not only are they absolutely the worst aliens I've seen in ages, they're the stupidest as well. They can't break down a freaking wooden door or boards.  Give me a break... these absolute cosmic rejects would be destroyed in mere minutes.
This movie is so very flawed it's hard to find the right words to describe it. All I can say is if you see some kind of deep message that you find awe inspiring, you're grasping at straws. Go join a local church group. As Mel pathetically says in a very weak voice: ""I'm insane with anger.. arrgh.""
- Rirath_com"
292,1.0,"Another alien invasion movie. It is about crop circles appearing around the world, signs of visitors from another world and everyone is freaking out. It was dark, dreary, and the acting...wow was it bad!  Everyone acted as if they were zombies staring mindlessly in space or at their televisions and talking to themselves. Then the real message came out. Mel Gibson's character is an ex-father and has lost his faith in God and is looking for a sign to re-new his faith. If I knew this movie was simply geared toward clinging to a religion instead of learning to be strong enough to stand on our own 2 feet, I never would have bothered with it. But then again, to mix religion with aliens and science is a different approach, one which I applaud, for if you believe your God created everything, then he created the aliens as well.  Still this doesn't make up for this movie being really boring. I am sure the director had good intentions but it is a very slow paced B-movie."
293,5.0,I freaking love this movie!
294,1.0,"The thing I hate the most about movies is when Hollywood preaches to me about how I should live my life. However, the second most annoying thing is when Hollywood takes a good idea and turns it into something awful and formulaic. Such is the case with LXG.
My knowlege of the novels upon which the characters are based aren't exactly up to snuff, but even I know that this movie destroyed the books. Dorian Gray did NOT die when he saw the painting. He looked at it all the time! He died when he destroyed the painting in the book. Mr. Hyde was NOT some massive hulk, he was just Jekyll's evil side, like an alternate personality. Not to mention Hyde became a good guy in the end of the flick, when Hyde is supposed to be purely nasty. The Nautilus is WAY too huge and WAY too gaudy. The invisibility potion rendered it's user insane over time, which obviously didn't happen to the invisible man in this one. And if Mina is a vampire, then why can she walk around in the sunlight?
However, if you can look past all that, this movie still stinks. The plot must have been fed through Hollywood's Formul-o-matic screenwriting machine, because it follows the lame action genre formula to the letter. There's the mistrust between group members, the inevitable betrayals, the using of everyone's ability to get the job done, etc. It's the same kind of schlock Hollywood has been spoon-feeding the public for a long time.
Sean Connery is too freaking old to play the action role. They have him running around, shooting at people and fistfighting. Right. He should have been slamming people with his walker and oxygen tank, then breaking his hip.
It's obvious that there was NO research done for the making of this movie. Even the when people are speaking German, the subtitles are way off from what they're actually saying. The technology is far too advanced, and the characters are poorly represented. Don't even bother with this lame movie. It's just another bunch of Hollywood hacks trying to cheat you out of eight bucks."

Why is it taking so long to get this on DVD?  Are there some technology complications I'm not aware of?  How freaking hard is it to get this thing recorded and make the media to send it out?"
297,1.0,"You'd think that a movie with 4 Academy Award Nominations and over 80 4-star rave reviews would be decent, but no. The Academy award nominations for this movie were so freaking relyable I nodded off and, God help me, fantasised about watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlefield-Earth/dp/B00003CXIV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlefield Earth</a>. Dont buy this crap movie. Lost in Translation is the most boring, unfunny, plotless, villianless movie I ever saw. This whole thing is 30 mintues of unfunny commercial retakes and Murray sitting at a bar, followed by an hours worth of dating scenes. How in the hell did this thing get so much praise, anyway?? I thought this movie would AT LEAST reveal a secret lover or SOMETHING! but nope.

The disc sucks almost as much as the movie does. ALMOST. It throws at you a ton of unskippable movie trailers before you get to the main menu, but thats not as much a bad thing as is sounds. the legion of unskipple trailers are in fact, preparring you for what is to come; the insane, frusterating wait to get to the main menu is but the mere introduction... to the insane, frusterating wait for the movie to be over. You see, I am the kind of person that, if I rent or buy something, I see it all the way to the end no matter what... but Lost in Translation almost became an exception. In fact, it practically was, because i fell asleep probably 6 times during this thing but never once did I become Lost in Duration. Even inbetween napping sessions, I knew exactly what was gioing on and I really, really, REALLY diddn't care."
298,4.0,"The ""Anger Management"" blu-ray has an outstanding, BEAUTIFUL HD picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's very sharp.  Too bad it's in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, who can enjoy that?  What, this movie about PEOPLE, which emphasizes dialog, needed an ultra-wide screen--thus way too narrow-- for freaking panoramic views?  Of what?  I never understand directors.

The audio is loud and very clear. This blu-ray is clearly better visually, esp., than the DVD version, a DVD which itself nonetheless looks very good on an HD TV.  I'm very pleased with this blu-ray purchase.

The story is pretty funny, the lines and delivery are hilarious, and it's Nicholson at his usual funny best, and Sandler (someone I can't stand generally), here subdued throughout, demonstrating a very different form of humor for him-- which he does well in this film.  I can watch this movie yet again, which I'd never say about any other Sandler film.

The script, story, and acting are first rate, with John Turturo particularly good in a minor role, too, and several well-known actors sprinkled throughout, plus some well-known NY Yankees players and Mayor Giuliani.

Recommended on all counts!"

300,1.0,"When is this trash gonna end? This whole franchise should've been stopped with the second film quite frankly. The original ""Child's Play"" was nowhere near a horror classic, but at least it was worth watching, and it took killer doll movies to a whole new level. They just couldn't leave well enough alone. Like so many other movies Hollywood has to flood the whole genre with a whole bunch of crappy and pointless sequels. This is definitely in that category. They ran this mess into the ground with ""Bride of Chucky"", and I can't believe they had the nerve to make a sequel to that. Sequels on top of sequels seems to be the Hollywood way these days. Afterall, nothing is original anymore. I mean, how many freaking ways are there to destroy a plastic doll, and now they have the doll reproducing. That's just outrageous. I can't see how people actually liked this movie. It was too stupid to be funny, and it didn't make any sense. To top it off, Jennifer Tilly.....PUHLEEZE! she has always been a joke so I guess this movie was on point with her, and it might just be me, but she has got to have one of the most annoying voices on the planet. With all that being said, if there's any justice in the world they will stop torturing us with all this madness."
301,5.0,".
One of the most interesting aspects of LIT is the market's reaction to it:  most of those who caught it in a theater loved it, and a great many who've seen it first on DVD are angry with it.
Why?
1) Well, the grouches are quite right--it's not much of a comedy, there's very little story, and the characters aren't going through giant transformations across the course of the film.  If you're sitting at home with your significant other or a bunch of friends, if you're talking, if the sound of crunching snacks in your head is louder than the soundtrack, if the lights are on or the phone rings, forget it, you're done--it's like visiting a zen rock garden with a GameBoy, and your only shot at liking this film is personally relating to what the characters have experienced, or if you've been to Tokyo.
2) The rabid fans are quite right too--LIT is an ""experience"" film that is mismarketed as a Bill Murray comedy; it's all about sights and sounds, not story.  It lets you know this from the very first shot, a long, wordless look at, um, Scarlett Johansson, with a quietly rising and subsiding sound clip from Kevin Shields, the songwriter of the greatest lost band of last twenty years, My Bloody Valentine (if you don't know, YOU BETTER ASK SOMEBODY).  There's every chance this bombs at home, but in a theater, in the dark, with great sound and everybody shutting up, it works.
That first shot sets the tone for LIT.  There's not a single jump cut or sudden burst of sound in the entire film--it's supposed to be a slow, alluring, engulfing experience; again, this is terrific in a theater, but it's a fragile spell, and it's easy to see why it might not work at home.
3) The grouches are also right when they criticize the dialogue.  In literal terms, not a lot is being said.  If you don't attach to the characters at all, it isn't hard to start hating a young, pretty, apathetic whiner and a rich middle-aged whiner, both given the luxury of fretting full-time over existential problems, which, if you don't like the leads, seem pretty trivial.  It's not hard to see why that doesn't make for a fun movie night.
4) The rabid fans can argue this one--LIT is very much about what's NOT said.
Think about the most verbal characters in the film: they're babbling.  The sweetly inattentive husband is wildly inarticulate--he's perpetually distracted, and constantly interrupting his own train of thought.  The starlet (a snarky sendup of Cameron Diaz) grows more vapid by the sentence.  Bill Murray's wife is nothing but a telephone voice, transfixed by carpet swatches and bored by everything else.  And from the dead-serious commercial director to the ebulliently idiotic talk show host, there's no clear translation of the spoken Japanese.  For God's sake, when she over-emotes her way through Scarborough Fair, the lounge singer is a self-parody, unintentionally echoing Bill Murray's famous SNL parody of a lounge singer pouring out Scarborough Fair.  Every one of them is lost in translation.
In a different way, so are Bob and Charlotte.  The reason LIT doesn't have a story is that the entire film is an interlude--two people who suddenly find themselves together, sharing a break from their lives.
And they both seem to really need it--they're sick of the meaningless conversations and logistics that drive their worlds.  It's a classic use of the medium, to show the huge gap between what's said and what's seen.  Bob and Charlotte are wonderfully quiet and accepting of each other from the get go--they don't have talk much to connect.  If you watch for it, there's a silent shift in the film:  before she meets Bob, Charlotte is rattled by how numb she feels when she visits a temple and retreats to her hotel room, surrounding herself with junk media.  Before Bob meets Charlotte, he sleepwalks through his workday, producing junk media.  After they meet, when they spend time on their own, they wander wordlessly and beautifully alone:  Bob golfs by himself with Mt. Fuji in the distance, and Mt. Fuji floats by Charlotte on a Kyoto bullet train, as she heads off to visit another temple.  They're discovering a less bewildering, more personal Japan, and retrieving themselves as they do it.  And all this is shown, not spoken.
5) The grouches have a point: nothing freaking happens in LIT.
6) The fans answer:  yeah, exactly.  The key to the film is what doesn't happen between the characters.  It's no accident that LIT takes place in bustling, frenetic Tokyo, or that the main characters are hopelessly jetlagged and out of sync with everything except each other.  If that doesn't sink in early, then you'll miss the many charms of LIT, from the long, lovely shots, the sweet, spare exchanges between Bob and Charlotte, the gorgeously slow shoegazer/trip-hop/dream pop soundtrack (the best since Trainspotting, High Art,and Ms. Coppola's last film, the Virgin Suicides), and the electrifyingly silent ending.
So, sorry if you hated this film.  Have a drink, maybe two, turn the off lights, don't talk, watch it again, and you might change your mind.
(Oh, and if you take into account EVERY image of Japanese people in this film--the businesspmen and women, the artists, the florists, the crowds in the street, the surfers, the strippers, the monks, the bride and groom, the elderly patient, the doctor, etc.--it's harder to argue that LIT is an anti-Japanese film, and easier to see it for what it is:  an outsider's POV of a few silly and sublime experiences in an unfamiliar culture)."
302,5.0,"It's nice that older people can enjoy this one as well. Comic book and movies are usually aimed at little kids, buit I could tell that this wasn't when a whole freaking theatre of the little brats was screaming, ""IS IT OVER YET?!"" about an hour into the movie and every five minutes.

 This was an excellent movie taking place a little while after the first one ended. It shows Peter Parker trying to jugle being a superhero, trying to make a living, and being there for loved ones all at once. It doesn't work out, as saving lives is top priority and he can't tell anyone about his secret for reasons of safety and love. Very interesting, kids don't get any of that of course.

 Doctor Octopus rocked too. A way better villian than the Green Goblin and octavius was way more charismatic than that whatever his name was that went psycho as the Green Goblin. Very enjoyable and fun movie, looking to be the best superhero series ever made."
303,5.0,"First off, I can't stress how good this movie is.  Stop reading this and click on the 'Purchase ASAP' button.  This is a masterpiece of the Drug Cinema and 'Masterpiece' is what it should be called.  Every day you hear about meth lab's exploding, or how meth literally destroy's a persons life.

Oh yeah, I forgot to add a green dog to the list of people above.  Get ready to see the city through eyes that can't sleep.  Their all Spun folks!  You owe it to yourself to get the 'Uncensored Director's Cut'.  This is a Tour de Force of grunge atmosphere...  A swaggering journey into Hell that conveys a chortling amusement.

304,3.0,"""Darkness"" is a paradox. On one hand the film achieves a primal terror, and it has sequences that are much scarier than most of the horror crap being turned out these days. At least this movie was not named after a bodily fluid and didn't star that ""7th Heaven"" kid. On the other hand, the movie could be better, and some parts tend to feel artificial and drag. Now normally when reviewing a horror movie, I don't mark it down for artificialness, but this feels really, really fake. Now, I didn't catch this movie in the theaters, but I thought I would rent it to see if it was as bad as critics said. I wasn't expecting much, and perhaps that's why I didn't mind it, but I only expect alot from movies I have been waiting to see for a while, like ""White Noise"" (terrible) or ""The Aviator"" (pretty good). This movie is not a Speilberg movie or even a Brian Singer film. The movie, putting it frankly, is good and effectively frightening, but it is unoriginal to the tenth degree. Shadows of ""The Shining"" and ""Se7en"" are present throughout the moie, and of course there is the requisite scene where the troubled teenage daughter has to make a decision that may or may not hurt a loved one. After the halfway point, the movie loses its feel of a more independant, low budget film and takes horror full circle. This may be good for some people, but others, like me, will think the change is too abrupt.

The PG-13 rated movie has parts that will make you say ""This is SOO PG-13"", like the scene where the father bangs on his sons door yelling and freaking this and frigging you and fricking that. The three times the f-word is used is used towards a repair man, and I couldn't help thinking that they should have used their limited supply towards the son, so that the scene would not have sounded so goofy. Althought the DVD boasts ""shocking unrated footage"", the whole thing in its entirety is not that shocking. The only thing actually added from the theatrical release is that the blade performing the tracectomy is scene going into the cadavers throat, and no blood is even seen! Well, actually a little is. We see the blade enter the throat and a drop of blood. Shocking. And it looks so fake it could be a cartoon. From what I've read, the DVD is just a ploy to get people to buy it since it was somewhat of a theatrical flop. I heard somewhere that the traceotomy scene is on the DVD just as it was in the PG-13 version, and that the only thing changed is the tiny drop of blood. Believe me, the only reason this DVD is ""unrated"" is because without that subtitle it would just have a slightly changed content description on the back of the box. Currently it is rated PG-13 for ""Disturbing Images, Intense Terror Sequences, Thematic Elements, And Language"", the DVD should be rated PG-13 for ""Violence, Disturbing Images, Terror, Thematic Content, And Language"". I have no clue what thematic elements are, but they must be something to do with sex or something. I'm just kidding of course about the sex thing, but I have no clue what they are.

When ""Darkness"" first starts out, it looks promising. It starts with a kid being interviewed about a ritual that he escaped from narrowly. The entire sequence is intercut with images (and they're disturbing, too!) of kids being chased by sinister looking people in cloaks. A disadvantage of the film is that many things happen in the 102 minutes that this movie runs, but alot of the things that happen have no explanation to how they are connected. The scene with the father and son in the car when the father has the first seizure goes on for about ten minutes, but it only needed a two minute setup. Eight minutes are spent on the father honking his horn and getting the other drivers mad at him. All the horn honking gave me a headache.

""Darkness"", although better than expected, has been getting made for five decades. Perhaps that is why it was delayed almost three years. For every stupid part, there is a scary one, and for every plot hole there is an explanation for another question that was raised. Half this movie is spent sitting around watching the power go out, and it gets old after about the tenth time the power dies. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of cheesecake. It's hard to get through, and when it's over you don't want much more. The Spanish countryside stereotyping doesn't work well either. The movie tries to be beautiful and picturesque, but it comes off as half-hearted and hackneyed.

The plot of the movie revolves around a ritual performed in 1962 during the solar eclipse. It involved seven children being slaughtered to free the evil inside of them, and although the movie never makes it clear, I believe it was some sort of Satanic thing. Flash forward forty years later. Regina (Anna Paquin) has just moved into the house that the rituals were performed in along with her family, mother Maria (Lena Olin), father Mark (Iain Glenn), and brother Paul (Stephan Enquist). They of course do not know about the ritual, and they are soon the prey of the stirring ghosts that still inhabit the house. The movie requires quite a leap of faith in terms of the plot, as one of the members of the family (I will not say who), has come back from the sixties and now lives in the house as part of the family (they are the kid that escapes). The moie asks us to believe this and the plot twist that leads up to it, but I don't buy it.

At the 80 minute mark, when the climax starts, people are worn out (I know I was) because the movie kind of catapults us into the action and the violence without checking back with the characters. The movie has some flaws, but it is good and scary for the most part. Even a scene where the ghost kids call Regina and tell her they are watching her and call her a bitch, while funny that they have no reason to call her that, and also because it's always funny to hear kids swear (especially girl scouts, like in ""Dodgeball""). What the movie needed was a larger amount of action and not just cram 20 minutes of it into the end. A good movie all in all, but it could have ended in a clearer way, and perhaps it was a sequel setup, but I was unconvinced.

""Darkness"" is rated PG-13.  Ignore the ""unrated"" version, it's just a longer PG-13 version, and had I not heard that I probably would not have rented it. It is true what you hear. ""Darkness"" may not be the best film of the year, but it is very scary and pulls off some great jump moments."
305,4.0,"The first 17 minutes or so of the movie shows Joel (Jim Carrey) waking up...going to work...and then freaking out. He has this sudden urge to rush to Montague (I'm not sure where that's at though). Joel is not the kinda of person that is spontaneous like that. But for some reason...he just has to go to Montague. He gets to a beach and sees a pretty girl in an orange sweater with blue hair. Being shy..he doesnt talk to her. But she notices him. When he is leaving Montague he notices that the girl is on the train with him now. The girl comes over and starts talking to him and introduces herself as Clementine (Kate Winslett). They hit it off and spend the whole day together having a great and wonderful and exciting (especially for Joel) time.

Then the title credits start to appear and Joel is crying his eyes out. We come to find out that when he goes into the store where Clementine works, she is completely ignoring him. So Joel is crushed and then his friends let him know what really happened. She erased him. Erased him from her mind. He's gone to her. So he's devastated and wants to do the same to her.

And that's when the real movie begins in my opinion. As the doctor begins to erase his memories, Joel is remembering most of them at the same time. So he's witnessing his memories dissapearing right before him. We come to find out that he's had a long relationship with Clementine. One that seemed like it was really fun and had so much love with the occasional arguing that most couples in love have. As Joel is remembering and actually living out these memories again, he realizes he screwed up and he doesn't want to lose Clementine forever. So he tries to wake up but cant. So he does the next best thing... he tries to hide her in memories that she shouldn't belong in. All the while you are sitting and watching their relationship from Joel's memories and you just want to wake him up yourself and send him off to get Clementine back.

This is not your typical love story. I found the love that Clementine and Joel share much more believable in this movie. They are opposites from each other. Joel is shy and Clementine is outgoing. Joel makes plans and Clementine is spontaneous. Joel is careful of his actions and Clementine is carefree. They both helped each other out. Clementine would help Joel have more fun in life, while Joel would help Clementine calm down just a tad. Many love stories have the same plot and the same fairy tale feel to it. This one didn't.

The reason why I give this movie a 4 and not a 5 is that there were some things in the movie that I just thought were getting in the way. I didn't like Kirsten Dunst's role between her and the main doctor. I thought the way the movie ended was definitley cool, but I still wish I coulda seen more.

I think everyone should at least watch this movie once. Especially if you are in love or have been in love."
306,1.0,"Everyone's got there own little theories on this movie as you'll see. I believe mine is correct. First off you'll note the main colors in the movie were red and blue. Couple that with all the white women and guess what you have? You guessed it: red white and blue or the USA. You'll note the rampant sex and lack of responsibility the little girl had? She's the UK's view of the USA personified. The clincher was how they just walked out in the open, buried a body IN THE BACKYARD, and then called the yardman over the next day to CUT THE GRASS!!! As if to say, ""HA! Screw you; we do what we want and there's nothing you can do about it! Piss on all you!!!"" (Political reference.) The yardman symbolized the American people: distracted and titilated by all the flashy terms and sights thrown around (a naked Sarah). Furthermore...
... Just kidding. If you've heard theories on this film let me tell you one thing you can believe: the person relating it was a pompous moron too embarrassed to admit that they, like you and everyone else, had no freaking clue what the hell this movie was about. Either that or they were even more egotistical and out of touch with reality to think that their baseless, crackpot theory was actually correct. Proof is in the number of theories about this movie (none of which agree mind you). I've seen one really good review of this movie. It said: ""What the...??!!!"" and that was it. Accurate and to the point. This movie made no sense. None. Zip. Nada.
Now some people get off on all that ""Wow, it was soooo great because it left more questions than answers"" thing, and that's all fine and good. (To be honest, this movie answered no questions but did in fact raise one every two seconds.) I personally see that as plain laziness and/or incompetence (and/or evidence of insanity and/or narcotics). Anyone with half a brain can create a film that leaves viewers going ""Wha'...???"" I could whip one out in five minutes if you'd all go see it and pay me for it. So, pardon me if I have no taste and don't go all fanboy over this piece of ""film""."
307,2.0,Above average movie. Stream on Xbox 360 wasn't good at all. Choppy or too soap opera like. Looked like 480p more then 720p. And it's not Internet connection because Avengers looks freaking bad ass.
308,5.0,"Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn are on top of their game in this hilariously entertaining comedy.  The premise has Vaughn facing eviction from his local run-down gym 'Average Joes' if he can't come up with $50,000.  Across the street is 'Average Joes' nightmare 'Globo-Gym' run by the hilarious Ben Stiller.  Vaughn and his team of losers including a nerd, a pirate, and man who seems to have down syndrum and a teen with girl issues, not to mention the girl the banks sent to repo his place of business (Taylor), deside to enter a dodgeball championship in order to win the money, which brings them to a final showdown with 'Globo-Gym'.  They enlist the help of Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn), a master of the dodgeball.  Rip is hilarious is every scene, with one liners like the one I used for my title that will keep you laughing harder and harder.  From start to finish this is one film that will keep you rolling...it's freaking hilarious.  Ben Stiller proves he is box-office gold and comedic genius!"
309,2.0,"""Garden State"" is an awkward hybrid of a Gen-Y coming-of-age tale and middle-period Barbra Streisand--think ""Prince of Tides"" or ""Nuts."" That said, it's a pretty pleasant viewing experience until about 15 minutes from the end, when a son-dad confrontation lets loose the tear-jerking and psychobabble to the point that the film's fragile charm is lost. Spell broken, you have a few more scenes to savor Natalie Portman's thespian stylings as ""wacky Queen Amidala in the burbs,"" Zac Braff's bizarrely puffy lips and a soundtrack that keeps things moving but never adds up to much. The DVD extras are painful: Everyone talks like they're making ""Citizen Kane"" or something. I guess they didn't read the script.
Is this all you have to say, Gen Y? Gee, this makes ""Reality Bites"" look like freaking Proust."
310,1.0,"White Noise, is the longest, most confusing,""techno-horror"" movie I have seen in awhile. The trailer that I saw at the movie theater had the explanation of EVP, Electric Voice Phenomena, when the dead communicate to the living through electrical devices like radios, Televisions, Cell phones (I guess they have unlimited nights and weekends on the other side `can you hear me now?'), they played real life EVP, the woman saying ""get out of my house"" and ""I love you"", it was really creepy. SO naturally I thought the movie based on these phenomena would also be just as creepy, but I was so wrong. The entire first 10-15 minutes was excruciatingly slow, we have the husband John, and the wife Anna, and there is this kid, who I didn't catch his name because he is freakishly quiet and really just background the whole time, I was confused on who the kid belonged to. The pregnant wife goes missing, and then dead, and thus begins the EVP, through a boom box, cell phone and other things, We get to see an EVP specialist who spends to much time indoors, and a grieving woman who needs some makeup badly (you would think her dead fiance would tell her through EVP to invest in some lipstick at least) We get some baddies that are represented through three shadows and a lot of cussing. John is supposed to be our hero, and I feel nothing at all for him! Who cares about his dead wife and kid when he doesn't even pay attention to the kid he has now? People die, babies are saved, and the three phantom cursers are holding some chick hostage (who I care nothing for, hello? Character development much?) In this entire confusing boring plot there are lots of TVs and computers with static and morphed faces and voices, but it's not scary at all! They should have made him hit the TV and Bam! A re-run of Method and Red pops up, now that is frightening! Michael Keaton is not an actor with a lot of range, his reactions and expressions are deadpan, and there were no other semi-big names in the movie to help him carry the load. In the end, he follows the clues his dead wife leads him to ""go now my love"" (yawn), and he finds the woman held captive by......a freaking construction worker? What? Who is being controlled by the three mahatma ghandi apparitions? They surround our hero and I guess tickle him to death, and breath stank rotten electrified breath and he topples over the edge, I wasted an hour and a half of my life to have nothing explained to me! Who were the spooks? Why was the construction dude murdering women?  Did they control him? How? Why did they trash his place? And the most important question of all WHO green lighted this Poo-fest? If I were in the spirit world and had a chance to communicate with the living I would definitely say  ""DO NOT WATCH WHITE NOISE......OR LISTEN TO JESSICA SIMPSON ON THIS RADIO"""
311,3.0,"~ENDING SPOILER~

White Noise is another one of many ""scary"" PG-13 movies to come out recently (i.e The Grudge, Darkness, The Forgotton,) most of which I haven't cared for. But I saw an interesting trailer for White Noise some months ago and decided this one might be worth checking out. As a kid, I remember being frightened by stories of EVP (Electrical Voice Phenomenon,) on shows like Sightings and the thought of it still freaks me out today. So I was instantly drawn to this idea of a scary movie.

For the most part, White Noise was moderately scary and that's a lot more than I can say for movies like The Ring or The Grudge, which I didn't find scary at all. The movie has a slow start, but the scary scenes it does have come unexpectedly. This is probably the first scary PG-13 that has actually made me jump at a few parts. With movies like the The Grudge, I completely anticipated the next scene where the ghost would pop and scare everyone in the audience except me. White Noise actually caught me off guard a couple of times. Plus, the general idea behind the movie itself was creepy, because there are plenty of real life EVP happenings on record and if you have ever heard an actual sound wave of one, you know that it makes the hair on your neck stand up on end.

Some things I didn't like about the movie. It did have a slow start. It almost got boring right before the first really scary part. I also found the climax to the movie a little confusing as far as storyline goes. I'm also kind of sick of seeing an ending where a CGI ghost that looks like black smoke attacks for the climax. It was almost a let down in the movie having a suspenseful buildup to the climax and end it with three computer generated ghosts freaking out indistinctly. Not a very scary ending. And I also thought the part right before the end credits, the part that's supposed to leave you on edge when you leave the theater, was kind of dumb and didn't really make that much sense.

All in all, not really too bad of a movie. I found it scarier (not saying I was scared out of my wits or anything) than a lot of these PG-13 movies coming out and a much better idea. But a dull ending kept the film from being good. Probably could've done with two or three more scary parts as well.

312,5.0,"God, what a great show! Since my husband and I got netflix, I decided to avail myself of the old TV shows I haven't seen in ages and that are now available on DVD.

This series was one of them.

I was delighted on how well written the who-dunnits are, and how great JB Fletcher's character is. I like how they portray her as an older lady that just wouldn't resort to knitting after her husband died. She instead followed her passion, and though she was probably about 60 when she did it, she still made a career for herself out of her hobby.

Angela Lansbury does a great job at showing how Jessica Fletcher is on the ball and always looking to help those wrongly accused.

I think that the heroine is an inspiration to women. Many people think that once you get older 'it's all downhill'. I'm relatively young ( 23) but I grew up with older parents ( my dad passed away at 67 and my mom is now 65) and I have seen how both men and women take age as something that is dreaded. My husband is 26 and now is freaking out about being almost thirty! I mean, come on!

But we all do it. However, JB Fletcher was no house wife; she was an active runner, writer, and loved every minute of helping the citizens of Cabot Cove out.

Rent this series, and the next! And the one after that! And enjoy the years ahead of you!"
313,2.0,"It's strange, but looking at the reviews this movie seems to be a love/hate movie. I can't imagine what makes it so polarizing. I found it cringe-worthy.

My biggest gripes: nearly every action scene is cartoonish. A stampeding horde of brontosauruses not only can't outrun humans... it runs with them, over top them, without stepping on anyone. For several minutes. The same problem happens with the rest of the crazy dinosaur/island creatures... they don't seem to adhere to any principle of physics and motion, but gnash and crash and fall down all over the place while magically avoiding the main characters.

Another problem is the love story. Why would a woman care about a freaking monkey? One that has eaten human sacrifices for decades, and that destroys everything whenever he feels like cutting lose. She doesn't recognize that part of him, just that he's a big sweet monkey who has love in his heart too. Aw[...] Not only that she doesn't just seem to like him as a friend. She seems to want to marry him. A 30 foot tall, man eating monkey. Of course, that's the original story, but they failed to help explain it any better.

One more gripe: Jack Black. Great guy, very funny. He screws up this movie because it's not a comedy. Sorry Jack but you don't belong in a dramatic action movie where everyone's waiting for you to crack jokes. He doesn't crack any, by the way, but there's the problem. He's not one of those guys who acts well outside his comedy, and as an important personality in this film it's almost embarrassing to watch him have no dramatic presence.

The one good thing is the visuals (for the most part, sometimes the CG feels disconnected from the actors), there's a lot of beauty shoved into some scenes."
314,1.0,"Seriously?  I lasted until the torching of the Mona Lisa...
""Humanity can't survive a 4th World War""...

So they try to eradicate emotions with a Vulcan-police force?
Or should I say the Observers from Fringe?

One that dresses like Neo in the Matrix...
And attempts to act cool and shoot like Trinity...
But just comes off as a mass murderer from some cheesy horror flick.

And they torch everything creative like in Fahrenheit-451?
And the 2nd cleric looks like he's developing a conscience and doubt like Guy Montag.
Gimme a freaking break.

If someone can tell me what original idea exists in this movie that is not a glorification of evil and violence, then I'll give it another go.

But until then, I'd suggest watching the ""BLOB"" or ""THEM"", if you want more sane realistic Science Fiction.
Geez."
315,3.0,"Is it great?  No.  Is it bad?  No again.  Is Sam Rockwell a freaking comedic genius?  Highly probable.  The CGI is pretty good, the creature-effects are a taste of 80's nostalgia, and fans of the book should be glad that the author wrote the screenplay.

Over all it IS entertaining, but it probably won't add up as a ""lasting winner""."
316,4.0,"Great movie. . . .for those who have read and understand the books. Alot seems to get lost int he translation from paper to film, resulting in most of the jokes being ""inside"" jokes that only fans of the series seem to catch.  My wife freaking hated it, but then again she has never read any of the books and unfortunetly for her, she says she never will now due to the experience of watching the film.
Too bad, since she will be missing out on one of the most facsinating and funny satire series of novels ever.
The movie was great for any fan.  Granted, it wasn't quuiittee as good as I was hoping for, but when you think about it, this is a tale that is incredibly difficult to weave into celluloid.  Honestly, I don't think that there could have been a better translation to a feature film than what was presented and fans of the series who say they were dissapointed should take comfort in the fact that Douglas Adams did actually write the screenplay, and who better to attempt the translation than the creator?
The cast did a great job and I was very happy with several of the performances, especially Mos Def, who was great as Ford.  Should have expected this since he is incredibly underratted as an actor in general.  Want proof that he has the skills?  Watch ""Something the Lord Made"" and be happy.
Martin Freeman will forever be Tim from ""the Office"" to me, but he did a great job as Arthur.  Sam Rockwell was wonderful as Zaphod, capturing the key elements of Stupidity and Impulsive Delusions from the original character.
I admit, I was thrown a bit by the addition of John Malchovich's character to the story, but hey, who are we to question the creator's script?
Watch this film if you are already a fan of the books, but if you are still uninitiated, read the books first so you get a grasp of it first before you take the ride.
Sounds really weird, doesn't it?  Better here to have actually read the book before the movie. . . . makes no sense. . . ."
317,4.0,"First of all, are we all in agreement that the books (the first four anyways) are BRILLIANT?? Yes.  That said I of course did not have my hopes too high for this film, however, as the release got closer, I started really feeling like they had better have done a decent job with this.  I mean come on, the material is too high quality to screw up as long as they stuck with it.  The result?  They did a good job.  I saw elements from the movies Brazil, Monty Python, Soylent Green in this film, maybe even Day of the Dolphin, and that is a good thing.  A few of the highlights for me:

1.  The dolphin footage from the beginning was fantastic!

2.  When Ford & Arthur get picked up by the Vogon ship, and they show it from their perspective i.e. from ground to interior of ship, was incredible.

3.  When Arthur sees his home devastated while the workmen start freaking out over the Vogon ship was excellent.

4.  The nature footage of the ""new"" Earth was simply beautiful.

5.  The ""sighing"" doors, I've GOT to get myself a recording for my doors!

I could go on, but for the ending, I think they should have said, ""ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS NOW SHOULD READ THE BOOKS!""  I'm very curious to see whether we'll have a second installement of the film, if it is as good a quality as this first film, count me in.  UPDATE: OK, I've watched this a few times now, and I'm updating my review to FIVE big stars, this movie is FANTASTIC, pure and simple.  Any nitpicks I had about casting or whatever is superceded by the brilliance of the picture, ENJOY!"
318,4.0,"Chalk this one up with Dodgeball and Starsky and Hutch as another in a string of dumb, low-concept little comedies of 2004. Of course, like those other two movies, this one's funny, and like Dodgeball, it works. Then again, like Hutch, barely and not all the time. I can't deny that Will Ferrell is emerging as a premier comic talent in his post-SNL days, and if you aren't laughing so hard you're wiping away tears - at least a few times - then check your pulse. Yes, this movie is stupid and yes, it draws on a pretty cardboard concept for 90 minutes. But Anchorman spruces things up occasionally with wacky, oddball little additions that don't make sense but are hilarious (a violent brawl of anchormen, involving great cameos, comes to mind). Will Ferrell's first movie as the total centerpiece (Elf was a kids movie, so it's on technicality) isn't as funny as the man himself, and it would have been better to completely embrace its stupidity like the slightly better Dodgeball. Luckily, though, there are enough moments of tear-inducing, knee-slapping comedy to keep this one afloat. By the way, the music freaking rocks. THE SOUNDTRACK: A+; THE MOVIE: B"
319,5.0,"You want reality? People want to talk about a movie being realistic and people talk about real events being movie-like. People that were even at historic events will say ""it was like a movie"". How can you ever know what it would be like to be on a plane that you and everyone on board knows is going to crash? You can't. It transcends waking consciousness. It still can be imagined, however. It can be portrayed in such a way as to give you the viewer *some* idea -I really believe this after seeing UNITED 93. And it is scary as hell. If you allow yourself to be absorbed by this film I feel you'll come as close as a movie can take you in having some sense -just some- of the sheer terror. You are going to die. It's over. It is over. Your life is gone. You begin to realize this. At first there is denial of coarse but one way or another reality sets in for you. You will never see your family again. You will never eat again, hug your child again, go to the park again, go to the movies again, make love again, nothing. Your going to die in the worst way. You are about to be broken, ripped apart, burned. What awaits you? Are you even able to think or you just overcome? The horror. The flood of emotion, of thoughts, images, your life flashing before you. People freaking out around you. Murderous little foreign relgious nuts, creeps with box cutters stabbing people. What are you going to do? What do you do? What can you do? You'll never really know unless your in that situation. Some people on that plane decided not to just sit there and wait to die. That's not too bad a way to go out. UNITED 93 is a fine film and does justice to this historic moment in American history. Credit is to be given to director Paul Greengrass [THE BOURNE SUPREMACY, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, and the upcoming GREEN ZONE(!)] for his talents in depicting real-life events in such an outstanding way.

Watch it alone or with someone who can sit through a movie without running their mouth. Turn the lights off, turn the cell phone off, shut up, and sit there straight through, no interruptions. But don't buy it, it's a rental. I don't know why or how someone would want to sit through this ride multiple times. One, maybe two trips is enough."
320,5.0,"I enjoyed the first one. I know there were problems with it. But it was an origin story and there were 5 characters to cover in very little time. I think the second improved on the first because it didn't have to waste any time with all that. By now you know who these people are and what they can do. My only problem with this movie is still Dr Doom who is really weak. I'm not going to soil any thing but...he's still lame. And the actor who plays him is pretty wussy too.

I wish they had left Doom completely out of the movie. He's really more of a distraction and doesn't serve much purpose other than being a minor headache to the F4's bigger problem which is...THE WORLD IS ABOUT TO BE EATEN!!! Which Doom doesn't even care about.

One more negative about this movie is Mr Fantastic dancing at his bachelor party. Wow...that was bad. The special effects here did not work at all.

But aside from that, everything else was fantastic. Dr. Doom, although still cheap, does get to do some really cool destruction. Johnny Storm is even cooler this time around and the Silver Surfer is pretty freaking awesome! Unlike Spider-Man 3, I didn't feel let down by this movie. Maybe because I didn't go into it with such high expectations.

The Fantastic Four isn't supposed to be some epic movie. It's more of some light hearted comic book fun. And it succeeds in doing that.

I don't know if another F4 movie is in order but I would love to see a Silver Surfer movie!"
321,5.0,"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a hard movie to describe. It's sort of a teen comedy, but it's not the average teen comedy (especially one produced in part by MTV). There aren't many side-splitting one-liners or over-the-top-gross out gags. The foulest word in the film is either ""freaking"" or ""crap"". The only physical violence in the movie is done by high school bullies or a local martial arts master. There isn't any sex (heck there's hardly any sexual innuendo). The movie doesn't even really have a point.

Yet, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE works and works exceedingly well. It's a hilarious movie filled with some extremely memorable characters. The characters are quirky and filled with foibles. Yet, bizarre as they appear, they are so realistic it's uncanny. Who doesn't know somebody like Uncle Rico? Had my maternal grandmother lived long enough, I bet she would have spent her weekends riding an ATV. Anybody else know somebody who thinks selling ""tupperware"" is a ""real job""? The characters in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE are people sliced out of the real-life heart of America.

The story of the movie resolves around high schooler, Napoleon Dynamite. He has a 32 year-old brother, Kip, who sits around at home talking to girls on the internet 4-6 hours a day. The brothers live with their Grandma, who sneaks out to do extreme sports with her friends. Grandma gets hurt 4-wheeling on some sand dunes and Uncle Rico is sent to ""help"" the brothers while Granny recovers. Rico still lives in 1982, just before the big high school football game when the coach didn't put him in and they lost. There's a girl at school named Deb who runs her own photography studio who has a major crush on Napoleon, though he doesn't figure it out for the longest time. Napoleon's best friend is a recent immigrant student named Pedro. Pedro decides he wants to run for class president and the rest of the movie revolves around Pedro's campaign and what Napoleon does to help his friend.

The actors in NAPOLEON DYNAMITE were pretty-much no names at the time the movie originally came out (Haylie Duff, sister to Hillary was, perhaps the biggest name at the time). Jon Heder, Tina Majorino (who played the girl with the map on her back in WATERWORLD), Aaron Ruell, Jon Gries, and Efren Ramirez are all excellent in their roles. In lesser skilled actors, their roles could have been spoofy, cheesy, or over-the-top. Instead, they grind their characters to reality.

The movie has a lot of great scenes and lines and is destined to become one of the most quoted movies of all time (right up with THE PRINCESS BRIDE, TOMMY BOY, and STAR WARS). The movie also boasts a delightful soundtrack that includes everything from ""Time After Time"" to the ""A-Team Theme"" to ""I Want Candy"". As quirky as the film is, it contains some strong messages about the importance of family, sticking by your friends, following your dreams, and being the person God created you to be. All of that and chicken talons, too. In short, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is one of the most bizarre, but best films from 2004."
322,4.0,"This is a small film, a very good one, told large. The director, Jared Hess, is a 24 year old wunderkind from the barrens of Preston, Idaho, and he has created a gem; a cousin to the Coens. This is a comedy that will sneak up on you, the stuff of belly laughs. Last year he did a 9-minute short film, PELUCA, starring Jon Heder, and it seems to have been the outline for this feature film. Hess is from Preston, and he filmed it as only a resident could; full of empty landscapes, lonely roads, farmers, ranchers, and rednecks. A scene where Napoleon gets a job for the day on a chicken ranch is worth the price of admission.

There have been numerous comparisons for this movie to WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE, and RUSHMORE. But for me this film stands firmly on its own. It plays out like an absurdist straight drama that also happens to be funny. It is reminiscent of some of the best moments in the Coen Brother's RAISING ARIZONA.

The film was a big hit at Sundance, and it has been distributed well; a lucky break for Hess. Wouldn't it be wonderful if more of the youth of our country could rally behind this tiny epic, and create it as a cult film; that for a moment they step away from the commedia del raunchy that they mostly immerse themselves in; that they actually laugh at themselves, the way they really are, just kids struggling to grow up? The 13-30 year old demographic dictates our art, our music, and our movies. This little film could go a long ways in restoring the missing heart, the naivete and grace to the comedic genre.

One real plus for me was the odd wholesomeness of this movie. There was zero profanity. Most of the time when a script deletes realistic high school vernacular, and changes the language to a lot of goshs, dangs, hecks, frigging, and freaking, it usually morphs quickly into the landscape of the lame. But somehow, Hess makes the lack of profanity work, and we don't miss it.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called Jon Heder,"" geek deadpan perfection."" He loved the film, and directs us,"" to laugh until it hurts."" Heder is a lanky beanpole with a red Afro, all Adam's apple and oversized glasses, and overbite. At first glance one sees a young Yahoo Serious, or a Scott ""Carrot Top"" Thompson. But no, Heder is more natural, more believable, more absurd, and wonderfully unselfconscious. He is less the over-the-top screamer. In his best moments, like when he played tetherball with himself, or practiced his killer dance moves in his room, he reminded me of some of the great clowns; like a young Jerry Lewis, and even the precursory shadings of the great ones like Jackie Gleason in GIGOT, or Jacques Tati. Heder is Napoleon Dynamite, a prince of Preston, a nerdish Conan out to slay demons, or maybe just to get laid.

The setting for the film seems to be the early 1990's. Napoleon, and his older brother, Kip, live with their grandmother, played by Sandy Martin, who does a great turn as a biker grandma, who still dates, eats entirely too much steak, and loves her llama. Aaron Ruell, as the brother Kip, a 32 year old who has been a nerd for so long he is oblivious to it, does a fine job with the role. He lives in front of his computer, logging countless hours in chat rooms, searching for cyber-love, running up huge internet bills. Tina Mjorino, as girlfriend Deb, was wonderfully wacky, off-center, and loveable. A former child star, from films like WATERWORLD, she is 19 years old now, and she is good enough to be slugging it out with the likes of Thora Birch, Jena Malone, and Christina Ricci for those Odd Girl parts. She found the sweet quirkiness and heartfelt honesty of her character. Jon Gries, an actor since 1968, son of famed film director Tom Gries, was very good as the arrogant deluded ignorant Uncle Ricco; a man stuck in the past, reliving a fake fantasy that when he played high school football he might have been a great star, even turned pro...if his stupid coach had not left him on the bench so much. Efrem Ramirez, as Napoleon's best friend, Pedro, is a veteran actor from 10 films. His baby face, and deadpan delivery served him well. He did an excellent job. When he decided to run for class president, against a popular cheerleader, the tempo begins to shift, and we begin to see that this sad and funny drama was going to bend into a kind of fantasy tale; with underdogs rising to the occasion, taking on overwhelming odds, and of course, emerging victorious.

In smaller roles we first find Diedrich Baker as the karate teacher Rex, and he is the most seasoned veteran of the cast, having appeared in 33 films. He had a lot of fun with this part, prancing around in his American flag ""bad-boy"" pants, and pushing around the local kids while taking their money. Then there is Shondrella Avery appearing as Kip's cyberlove La Fawnduh. She is one hot mama, and she seems to like short skinny white dudes. When Kip boards the bus with her, bandana on his head, glasses in his pocket, suitcases in his hands, leaving home for the first time, we realize the film has come full circle, and now is a fairy tale.

I had approached this film skeptically not being sure how I would react or relate to it...but it won me over. It was not just another dumb comedy that would disintegrate two points off my intelligence quotient just by sitting through it. Rather, it was a fine little film, large on ambition, that I came to care about. I recommend it highly."
323,2.0,"If there is one thing I have learned watching all these end of the world and zombie apocalypse movies then it is that I would be worried about other human beings just as much as I would be about the end of the world. One would think that with the world having come to an end and plagued by flesh eating animated corpses, human beings would rise above the occasion, drop all the pettiness, greed and hate and band together. But not so, as apparently apocalypse or not, humans somehow still seem to manage to rival, and sometimes even outdo, the zombies in terms of evil and cruelty. This is where Land of the Dead is set.

It is the world several years after the zombie take over and the few remaining humans have barricaded themselves in a part of the city. Those rich and powerful enough (how?) have moved into a high rise they turned into a small living city with all the luxuries you can imagine, while the rest is on the cold streets, barely eeking by.  The ""rich"" have hired hands who go out in armored trucks and scavenge goods from nearby houses and department stores for them and it is almost comical watching these rich pukes pretend like nothing of catastrophic proportions has happened as they go by doing ""business as usual"". I mean the world has come to an end and you hear advertisements for the stores in that high rise and see these people dresed up and sitting in a 5 star restaurant being served fine food. Never underestimate the power of denial. Tension ensues when one of the hired hands gets snubbed by his boss and seeks revenge. The specifics are irrelevant at this point because Land of the Dead is not one of those smart, even bleak zombie apocalypse movies about the end of human kind and the fall out of that; it isn't even so much about survival and asking the tough questions; instead it is your typical, run of the mill action movie a la Escape From New York or something with zombies and all the gore that accompanies them thrown in. Here story is secondary.

What made this all ridiculous was the fact that the zombies basically stopped being zombies and developed intelligence, organized, knew how to handle tools and basically became much more than evil animated corpses, which IS THE WHOLE POINT OF ZOMBIES. They aren't supposed to be intelligent, thinking things through, organize, assemble and be freaking McGuyver or something. I think that sort of defeats the whole purpose of this genre. Zombies are great because unlike any other horror villain, zombies don't have a will of their own and are bereft of consciousness and self-awareness, yet ambulant and able to respond to surrounding stimuli; they don't seem to have a reason for being really other than feeding on the living and moving on in their brain dead daze. That is what makes zombies so terrifying and changes the landscape of a movie from delightfuly scary to unexpectedly terrifying. A zombie is not supposed to think and assemble tools - he is no longer a zombie then. This movie ventured into that direction to the point of trying to evoke sympathy for them and their ""cause"". Zombies going to take revenge, crying when one of their own is ""dead""....come on.

This movie wasn't eerie, it didn't provoke that feeling of desolation and desperation you expect nor that of horror or terror; it was sort of like Mad Max (in terms of the post apocalyptic depiction) meets Water World, Total Recall and zombies or something. Overall I wasn't very impressed with this. It is entertaining if you can manage to suspend disbelief completely but pretty low quality script wise. Bad writing, two dimensional characters, non existent character development, ridiculous premise of the ""zombie cause"" and trying to get sympathy for them as if they were just ""misunderstood"" or something, clichees piled on top of more clichees and predictable at every turn. Me thinks not."
324,4.0,"Horror movies almost always make money. It's an easy formula: create a monster, cast attractive people, and then have the monster kill them. All you really have to do is make people jump once or twice and your job's finished. It's also why most horror films are terrible. Land of the Dead, while not perfect, manages to be a unique horror film, because it believes horror movies can do something other than make people jump in their seat, although it does that too.

Land of the Dead is the fourth film in George A. Romero's Dead series. While the previous films involved the eventual decline of civilization, this film revolves around the last remnants of humanity trying to create a new civilization. The only problem is that the new civilization looks a lot like the old. In fact, it looks a lot like ours. Land of the Dead is a straight ahead allegory. It's not quite a mirror image of today's political climate, but it's awfully close. This is both a strength and weakness of Land of the Dead.

The plot revolves around a group of raiders who make a living going into the outlining suburbs and ransacking them for supplies. After a night of raiding, Cholo (John Leguizamo) decides that it's his last. He wants to buy his way into Fiddler's Green, a high rise building where all of the affluent live surrounded by the poor throngs, like Cholo, who work for them. When the owner of Fiddler's Green, Kaufman (Dennis Hoffman), makes it clear isn'tt Cholo isn't the kind of person who can live at Fiddler's Green, Cholo steals Kaufman's specialized armor vehicle Dead Reckoning. Cholo threatens to fire off Dead Reckoning's missiles at Fiddler's Green if he isn't paid five-million by midnight. Riley, one of Cholo's fellow raiders, is enlisted by Kaufman to find Cholo and stop him before the midnight deadline.

Oh, and there's a side plot about the zombies (often called stenches) starting to gain the ability to think.

The analogy is there for anyone looking. Cholo starkly states that he's performing ""jihad,"" and when he hears the demands Kaufman says he doesn't ""negotiate with terrorists."" Romero is examining how marginalizing certain groups causes dissatisfaction and anger to boil over into violence. There are many examples of this around the world, and one of the most recent were the riots in France. While Romero never asks us to like Cholo, he does expect us to understand why he's doing what he's doing.

I enjoy it when escapist fair tackles more serious subject matter. While they can never truly probe the problems as deeply as a more dramatic piece, the effect of recontextualizing real world problems in a fantasy setting can help us see things in a new light. It may never give us answers, but may help us tackle a problem from the flank rather than head on. catharsis certain amount of catharcis in seeing such serious issues cut to their essence and treated as escapism. Such a blatantly political theme in a horror movie is brave to say the least.

The problem with the film is also its strength. At times the allegory becomes stretched. A ready example is when Riley chooses not to fire on a band of zombies because they're just trying to ""find their way."" I know the zombies are there to symbolize the marginalized people outside of our boarders, but c'mon, they're freaking' zombies! Heck, they were just eating people! Maybe Romero feels that his message is too urgent not to shove it in our face, and while I can understand this proposition I feel it hurts his art. Romero was able to insert his political message into Dawn of the Dead in a less labored manner.

That being said, Romero does a fine job of creating a world out of a tiny budget. Seeing how much people can do with a small budget used to be one of the highlights of horror films. Would The Evil Dead be as good if you didn't know that it was filmed in a few months with virtually no budget and no experienced filmmakers? Now that horror movies are becoming less ambitious and special effects cheaper, I haven't seen a movie try and stretch a budget anymore. Romero does a fine job and adds a few details here and there that show you why he's so good in the first place. The first shot in the film is a diner sign spelling ""eats.""  It's a clever bit of dark humor in a film about flesh-eating zombies. This may seem like an odd thing to say, but the gore is gleeful in its excess. When an army officer tries to throw a grenade, a zombie chops off his arm causing him to fall onto his own explosive and blow up. It's deliciously twisted. There are several scenes of gore that are painful to watch not because of the amoung of blood, but because they focus on things you could imagine actually hurting. You'll know them when you see them. Romero goes out of his way to show us things we've never seen in a zombie movie before.

While not on the level of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, Land of the Dead should satisfy Romero fans. It's almost enough for me to forget the awful Dawn of the Dead remake. If Romero is back in the game, then hopefully other horror movies will try and keep up."
325,3.0,"Personally I was really looking forward to this film.  I wanted to see it in the theaters but never got around to it.  Last night my wife and I sat down to enjoy what I thought would be endless laughs but instead were left wanting, really wanting.  No, this film is not by any means terrible, but it lacks the pure comedic timing that was promised by the previews.  Yes, the reviews for the film were somewhat all over the place, but I never listen to critics anyways.

High Grant was probably the best part of the film, as he always shines as the morally ambiguous pr*ck.  Mandy Moore was also delightful, as she is always, but I did feel that her performance was far from her best.  This film really takes more of a crack at the current President then American Idol.  This is the film Bush DOES NOT WANT YOU TO SEE.  As a matter of fact, Dennis Quaid is pretty good here, especially towards the end when on the show and he says ""turn that freaking thing off"" and then looks at Hugh as if he didn't do anything wrong...priceless.

So the plot is so much different then I expected it to be.  There are terrorist that plan to kill the president during the finale of American Dreamz and they use show tune loving Omer to do it.  The cast for the most part does a fine job; Dafoe (who I normally can't stand) takes on the Cheney role quite nicely, but as always, the main comedic timing fell on the part of the token gay guy played by Tony Yalda.  As Omer's cousin Iqbal, Tony plays the horrible dancer/singer who dreams of stardom and who everyone mocks in ridicule.  Hilarious.

Anyways, here I've gone a praised it but I must add that although there are funny moments, they are for the most part sprinkled in amidst generic teen comedy fluff and it never really becomes it's own film.  So, to quote Martin Tweed... ""Am I lovable?""...not really, but I did `like' you if that makes you feel any better."
326,4.0,"I actually walked into the theater expecting a not-so-great film, but I was very wrong about that.  This movie was awesome.  I am an avid Marvel comic fan and I love the Fantastic Four, they are definitely on my list of favorites.

I thoroughly enjoyed the story, I loved all the characters but my favorite is Ben Grimm.  I thought his rock suit wouldn't be believeable onscreen but it actually is, and I was pleased with that.  I was also grinning ear to ear when those two vintage FF lines were put into the movie ""It's clobberin' time"" and ""Flame On!"".  I absolutely loved the onscreen relationship between Johnny and Ben, it was hil-freaking-arious, very good indeed.

A couple gripes with the film.  I wasn't too happy with how they changed Doom's origin, but I understood that it's hollywood and they were gonna make some tweaks.  I didn't like how Doom had powers, the last time I checked he was a scarred man in a metal suit, who was very brilliant, a megolomaniac, and a tyrant.  And lastly I wasn't happy with how Vic's voice underwent no change at all from man to mask.  When he was in the Dr. Doom get-up and he delivered his lines I didn't buy him as the menacing Doom, it didn't sound threatening at all, ya know?  I have a feeling in the second movie they'll change his voice and they'll probably explain it too.  That last scene in the film gave me the gitters, I can't wait for the sequel...let's hope for Doombots!!!"

The film was rated R, and so my Dad impatiently waited in line with me, happy at least I had read a book. We were surrounded by teenagers and a long-haired theater employee was controlling the massive throng with a megaphone (I kid you not). Ah the glorious days before videos and cable TV, when faded posters of ""Planet of the Apes"" still hung on the wall. The eerie film did not disappoint, a well-crafted example of atmosphere, music (allowing composer Jerry Goldsmith to win his only Oscar -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Omen-Original-Motion-Picture-Score-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00005PJ9D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Omen: Original Motion Picture Score (Deluxe Edition)</a>) and a quartet of wonderful performances (Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Billie Whitelaw).

Was ""The Omen"" remake necessary? Nope. Is it good? Surprisingly so. The key is casting, and in every instance filmmakers succeeded. Liev Schreiber is perfect in the lead of Robert Thorn, with fine support provided by Julia Stiles as his fateful wife Katherine. An appealing couple on the political fast-track, they move to England where Robert will serve as ambassador. Katherine's child dies during birth and behind ominous closed doors, Robert accepts a newborn baby to raise. Unbeknown to the picturesque couple, he's the son of Satan. Damien - perhaps the most famous name in film history - seems innocent enough, with the exception of piercing eyes, coal-black hair and an annoying tendency to have people around him die horrible deaths. There's also the menacing Father Brennan (finely played by the late Peter Postlethwaite), showing up at inopportune times, freaking out the Thorns while spouting Latin about the antichrist.

Robert realizes a great mystery is upon his hands and teams with photojournalist Keith Jennings (David Thewlis) to crack the case of Damien. Will they be able to stop Armageddon?! It's hard to take much of this seriously today, especially when Mia Farrow arrives on the scene as the creepiest caretaker since, well, Minnie Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby."" But by God, it's a well-made film and in many cases an improvement. The movie never plods like the original, is well-edited and has a superior sense of mood and atmosphere. It also takes full advantage of the creepy locales of Seltzer's novel. This is the best film of director John Moore's average career, and he shows an impressive respect for the source material. And yet, if you've seen the 1976 classic, you'll be overwhelmed by the strange sense of deja-vu, aided immeasurably by the 1978 sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Damien-Omen-2/dp/B00096S48K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Damien: Omen 2</a>, with William Holden and Lee Grant doing an essential retread of the original.

328,5.0,"The movie world is full of countless flicks that will make you jump, scream and maybe hurl your popcorn across the cinema. Boogeymen creep from closets. Lunatics are killed but keep getting up. Tiny dolls with knives menace entire communties. Most people enjoy a harmless fright. It's all good once the credits roll and the theater is lighted again.

Hostel is not a harmless fright. It's bleak, bloody and bold and suited only for those who like to wander to the really dark places. It's a gloomy, hard tale every bit as traumatizing to the intellect as it is repulsive to the eye.

In short, I freaking love this movie. And it all starts with lively music and naked people. For the first 45 minutes, I wanted to be a reckless teen again. I wanted to get myself a passport and backpack and prepare to tramp all over Europe. I wanted to wander with my friends and experience the liberal offerings of those far flung countries. I wanted to indulge in all the vice so vividly advertised in the opening scenes of the movie.

By the time it was done, I had endeavored never to leave the safety of the United States. Nossir. I'll burn the passport, drop the backpack in a river and stay right here where 911 is always a finger's length away.
Much fuss is made about the graphic violence in ""Hostel."" It's certainly graphic and violent as they come. Yet, it's not the blood and gore, drills and saws that will leave you unsettled. More disturbing is the concept at the very heart of the tale. The idea that Americans abroad could be snared into a sinister underworld and then sold to wealthy sadists to do with as they will. What gnaws at you is how handily such a business could operate.
There's a scene midway through the film where a young man awakes with a hood over his face and only a small hole to see through. His feet are bound to the floor. His hands are bound behind him. He is a prisoner in a dark, dingy roomand the horrible truth of his situation becomes abundantly clear soon enough.
The movie works because it plants you in that very chair. You feel the rising desperation as it becomes evident what your role is here. You are a plaything for a madman who has paid good money to satisfy all the depraved longings in his sick heart. At his disposal is a nauseating variety of tools. There are drills and blades, saws and hammers, needles and scalpels. All the things that have scared you since your first visit to the dentist or doctor are right here and there will be no anesthesia.
Yeah, it's pretty damn jolting when the first young man gets a drill bit sunk into his thigh. But more revolting is the notion that this is the only beginning. Because a person who pays enormously for such nasty pleasure is surely not going to be quick about it. You feel the grinding and growing horror of the victim's plight. Screaming will get them nowhere. This is a place designed specifically for screams. There will be no human rights groups stopping by. There will be no U.S. led rescue operation at the last minute. This is a place with a name like Ardvarkia, or Ohyuckia. The safety of home is a long ways off and the people back there are blissfully unaware of this strange country and of the terrors therein.
Sure, in-your-face images of dismember legs and hanging eyeballs will ruin your popcorn. But it's the heavy feeling of isolation and helplessness that will cloud the rest of your day.
There are plenty of people who refuse to see this flick. If they are timid about unrestrained nastiness, I don't blame them. Don't blame them at all. But if you're even mildly curious about the movie, I say go. Go spend a couple hours with Tarantio and Eli Roth, and you'll feel a little better about missing those overseas trips when you were a cocky college kid. You never go the high times in Barcelona, it's true. But at least you have all your fingers and you never had an eyeball dangling against your cheek.

If you still get a giddy delight watching the ear scene in ""Reservoir Dog,"" go see this movie. Just cut your date some slack if he or she starts squeezing your hand with bone crushing might. It's only human to recoil against atrocities committed against humans. And a story that can reach a person on that primitive level is a success. I give ""Hostel"" two thumbs up to go with the three or four laying on the floor."
329,4.0,"Now this was a horror movie. You all probably know what its about so I won't elaborate about it here. Director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) has made one hell of a horror movie. Finally an original horror movie. I'm so sick of the redundant slashers, remakes (sans a few) and crap that they throw out nowadays. This was quite a refreshing movie.

What made this movie great? First off a solid cast. Jay Hernandez does an excellent job in his role, he stands out among the rest in my opinion but that's not to say that the others were bad, they were good as well, Jan Vlasak, who played a business man on a trip to the same place, took the role of the main villain (even though he might not quite be the real bad guy) and he was great as well, really creepy. I know the one question, for those who haven't seen it, as you're reading this: ""Is it really that gory/disturbing/bloody?"" The answer is: No. It's not as bad as you think it will be. Sure there's blood, sure there's torture but not to the extent that its played out to be. Alot of it is suggested. Of course, that's not to say that its a slouch in the gore department. There are plenty of dismemberments and moments that'll make you cringe. The movie gets off to a fairly slow start. There's lots of nudity (Roth even gets away with a full frontal) for the first half and throughout that first half there isn't really any horror aspects. I think Roth put so much nudity in to take the MPAA's attention from the torture. It worked too, I can't believe this movie didn't get slapped with an NC-17. It's a dark toned movie with blood and torture and nudity. Once we get to the second half, the parts that everyone really came to see, we get a hell of a show though. One problem though is that at some points the movie is so dark (contrast-wise) that you can't see what's going on most notably during the ""eye"" scene, there was a clip posted on the internet, dunno if anyone caught it. Anyways, it actually looked much better and much more convincing on the screen than it did during that clip on the internet, it also doesn't fade to black when he's cutting the eye out either like it did in the clip, the camera stays right on the face and damn is it great. I don't think that was done on purpose to make you think you're seeing something and make it more intense, it's just too dark, they should really think about lighting it up for the DVD release. Now I'm going to compare these two movies now; it was more intense than last October's release of Saw II. Much more. I guess the one major flaw is that it takes so long to really get going that it seems over a little quickly. Call me sick but I came for some gore and torture and I think that they could've shown more torture and really gotten to the audience. Don't get me wrong though, what they did show was freaking awesome! Now, I'm not saying that movie need a ton of gore, that's not what makes a movie, not at all. A horror flick needs suspense and this movie has suspense and lots of it. Don't let the slow start sway you though, it's not boring (the first half) it does set you up for the rest of the movie and makes you feel like the friends are really connected. So no, this movie is not perfect but it's a great one, certainly one I'll pick up on DVD when it hits around May-June (in the inevitable Unrated release). The score was pretty good, nothing over the top but that may have been a good thing. Oh and another problem that just came to me was that Roth uses the F-Bomb way too much. I understand in some parts, hell if that was me getting tortured or in those situations I'd be yelling it out too but he used it at such awkward times, it's like he just said ""Hey, let's use that here!"". After this movie, I vowed to never EVER hit a Slovokian city. Check that one off the list (not that it was ever on...).

So yeah, this was a good horror movie. I didn't really touch on everything (I don't think) so I may go back and edit this later if I think of something else to say. So if you're a horror fan then do yourself a favor and see Eli Roth's Hostel."
330,4.0,"For my 666 review I decided to take on the remake of `The Omen' which could turn itself into a horrible mistake for anyone who's the slightest bit superstitious, but luckily I'm not even remotely so I'll sleep more than fine tonight.

This remake has received an awful lot of flak right off the bat for following a pattern similar to that of the 1998 `Psycho' remake, following the original script almost to the T raising the question, `why make a remake if it's shot for shot the original?'  Well, to answer that question it's for money.  A glossy new remake, regardless if the dialog is identical, will at least look far better than any film made in the 70's and in that respect `The Omen' succeeds with flying colors (one reviewer even mentioned his love of the colors used in this film and with that I must concur).

As far as the complaint that young Fitzpatrick isn't quite scary enough, come on, we can't all be as creepy as say Cameron Bright (who I wish was younger and could have tackled this role...that kid is so freaking creepy).  But regardless, little Davey does a decent job at playing possessed.  Better suited for her role was the original Rosemary herself Mia Farrow who was excellently cast and proved to be the biggest highlight of the film.  As far as parents Stiles and Schreiber are concerned, I actually feel they deserve props for this, especially Julia who plays the troubled mother perfectly.  I really wish she would get the role of a lifetime that really takes her over the edge of stardom.  She's certainly talented enough.

So bottom line is, while so many have already pointed out the un-necessity of this film, `The Omen' delivers enough scares and enough solid acting to warrant a watch through, and while it's not perfect and it may not be better than the original, it's no worse."
331,4.0,"Aright, You're all right, this movie has a really weak plot, but I think the best thing for you people who have nothing better to do than bitch because the plot sucked, or ""there wasn't enough sword fighting"", Really need to get a bottle of qualudes, a pack of razor blades, and run yourself a warm bath. This movies great in the fact you don't have to think to hard. You can just sit back and let it take you, or turn it on for back ground noise when you're doing something else, and probably turn around and stop what you're doing because you just caught one of the eye popping special effects scenes.

You people who think that the only good movies are those that make you think and go hmmm, are fools. You're all probably the self absorbed idiots who watched Magnolia and thought it was a freaking masterpiece.

So for you, The other People who just want to watch a movie and not take anything to seriously, and just be WOWed by special effects then this is the movie for you.... Have Fun and Enjoy."
332,3.0,"I liked ""Hostel"" for the most part, I expected a ""SAW"" ripoff but I was glad that they altered the plot to not make it into another serial killer movie.

With that said, it is pretty violent, however amazingly I still think it wasn't too gory afterwards probably because I've seen my fair share of movies like these (Audition, CAT III)

Yes it's predictable, silly in some parts but in horror movies that goes with the territory. In this day and age after a million horror movies have been released over the past thirty years it's hard to be shocking or original anymore.

The acting was OK, the plot good, the twists OK as well. For me the second half of the film saves it, they even managed to add some humor to it. I have to admit as well when the American tourists who is still alive goes on his revenge spreed, the Audience I saw it with loved it....especially we'll you'll see.

(Spoilers)

We'll the plot gives a lot away a couple of horny American guys go aboard to Europe and find the ""Hostel"" hotel where they think they're fantasies will come true.

Enter Natalya and Svetland the local sluts who in fact are part of the torture ring in which they get paid for their ""services""

Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are too naive to see what's going and when they get drunk they fall for the trap.

Josh is tortured brutally (as with all the other victims in the slaughterhouse).

There were some memorable images, Paxton's ""tour"" of sorts inside this asylum is very creepy. Especially when he sees that this bastards clearly are getting a sick satisfaction of doing this.

He escape by sheer luck , and thus his revenge takes place. Hernandez is good in this although there's not too much character development. His revenge is pretty well played out though.

I'am sure we might see more blood and mayhem on a DVD cut but for now Hostel is a pretty entertaining but perverse little flick.

It was as Quentin and Roth admit filmed on a low budget and it shows but they do manage to use that to an advantage setting up some creepy shots and delivering the ""goods"" when the movie calls for it.

It ain't that bad of a movie, Quentin did produce it so it ain't too bad. Now there's word of a possible ""Hostel 2"". Interesting stuff. I would recommend but be warned of the content.

Ask for those (...)who complained about how sick the
movie is or it's in bad taste? Damn people get a life!!!!

It's only a freaking movie, and it's geared for horror,
if it's not to your liking go rent a Disney flick.
If you don't like the movie for the content alone
and don't ever bother to discuss the script,
acting or directing then you're really not doing
a good review."
333,1.0,"In other news, I've been watching The Day After Tomorrow - the disaster picture in which the world gets turned on to a whole new ice age.  This movie is pure liberal propaganda.  Disgust you to see it.  In the beginning of the movie there is much drama about the US not signing onto the Kyoto agreement, and how this is basically the cause of the havoc that the movie is all about.  Then we are treated to the main human interest characters:  a scientist couple who are divorced (natch) and have a somewhat hostile relationship but who are bonded by their common interest in the welfare of their only child - an unmasculine teenage boy who is afraid of flying in airplanes and who grips the hand of a teenage girl companion for comfort during a bumpy flight.  Real he-man stuff.  It seems to me typically liberal that the scientist couple only had the one child.  Why strain yourself, am I right? And the girl he's got the hots for seems strangely moribund, like she doesn't get enough fresh air or something.  In the scene on the plane, the boy is trying to combat his fear of flying by gobbling candy.  Typical liberal behavior.  Moving right along, once the ice-age storm really gets going, and threatens to engulf North America, there is footage of Americans in droves trying to cross the border into Mexico.  Much reporting on the irony of this ""flood of illegal immigration INTO Mexico""  The Mexican government is sealing the border until the US President cuts a deal whereby the Mexican border is opened to desperate gringos (""Ju e-like me ahora, eh gringo?!?"") in exchange for - get this - the US forgiving latin American debt.  I'm not making this up.  Yet another example of how meddlesome liberals are.  You can't even see a freaking movie without it turning into a liberal indoctrination center on you."
334,3.0,"Saw 2 was *just* good enough to make me want to get the third one. Since it was, like, four bucks here for the Blu-ray, I thought, Why not?

Short version: It's the goriest ""Saw"" yet, but still not as gory as some other flicks, notably the remake of ""I Spit On Your Grave"" (hey, wanna watch forty-five minutes of sadistic rape? Or do you prefer the girl's rather creative and tortuous revenge sequences that would make Jigsaw flinch?), nor is it on the level of some of the classics, like ""High Tension"", ""Suspiria"", or ""REC"", probably because Saw doesn't seem to take itself all that seriously, but the other flicks do. ""Hostel"" also does the same thing, which makes it more potentially disturbing. The entire ""Saw"" series is a bit cheesy, really, and takes a few too many creative liberties when it comes to plot and realism. At least the other films mentioned tried to look realistic, but the Saw series is almost comical in comparison, with far too much emphasis on all that crap about Amanda, and other things virtually none of us cares about. Just get to the damned traps already; we don't give a damn about Amanda or the prequel part or any of that garbage. Since when was ""Saw"" known for its masterful storytelling? Right, never. It's the puzzles that hook us, so stick to the damned puzzles. ""Saw III"" tries way too hard to make itself into a cohesive story, as if anyone cares at all, but it pretty much makes up for it with the traps involved, the entire freaking reason we go to see the films. (Unfortunately, as we all know now, the Saw series got progressively worse as it tried to make itself more than a gorefest with some stupid story thrown in we always skip over in our players).

I was a little worried going in that this was going to be a cash-in sequel that doesn't even try to hide that it's a cash-in sequel--you know, just gore, gore, gore, with no creativity in there, which is why I think anyone watches Saw to begin with. You want to see people die or come close to death through the ""puzzles"" they have to suffer through. Yeah, it's sick entertainment, but it's a good premise, and Saw III actually goes the extra mile here and does multiple ""traps"" at the same time. No one cares about Amanda or anything except the ""traps"", so what we get here is pretty good, and it even has arguably a better twist ending than the second one. It's quite a whopper that you very likely won't see coming. I had a guess, because I knew the plot couldn't be as straightforward as it seemed at first; that wasn't Saw. Something that changed everything had to happen, and here, it does, and it does so with gusto. I have to say, it was very satisfying. The final few minutes with the big reveals are a treat, and you get psyched-out a few times, but not for no reason, but because it's critical to the idea behind Jigsaw's plan.

The short of it? There's plenty of gore, some unique deaths (and one involving drowning in dead exploding pig juice that is rather icky), and the whole twist ending thing Saw always does. The opening one we get is pretty high up there as likely the most potentially disturbing, and for people who love this stuff (like me) and actually like how sick they're willing to go in a film, it was a fun thing to watch (but you've got to admit that the rules were downright unfair for all he had to do--a minute and thirty for all that, plus escaping before he's blown up? Who could do that in a minute and thirty?). It's got the gore, the screams, the pain, all the stuff we love to watch.

The thing is, Saw will never replace the horror films out there that are willing to push the envelope to near-impossible levels. Now, I understand that wide-release horrors can't be on the level of, say, the ""I Spit On Your Grave"" remake, which involved, among other things, a *forty-five minute rape scene*, and someone getting a shotgun through the mouth...in reverse. You'd have to see it to know what I mean. In any case, that was easily NC-17 material, with full-frontal nudity, unrestrained sadistic rape, gratuitous torture, and an emphasis on pain, rather than gore, which actually makes it unique. It's also not quite on the level of ""Hostel"" or ""High Tension"" or ""Suspiria"" or a bunch of other horror flicks, mostly foreign, you've likely never heard of. They get more liberties, or something, I dunno. American horror films don't get as much room to work with, I suppose.

Not bad, not great--too heavy on worthless story none of us watched any of the films for, and too many breaks to go into the history of Jigsaw and Amanda, and other things absolutely no one cares about. Seriously, all we want is traps. Do nothing but give us Jigsaw making traps for 90 minutes, make them creative and well-designed, and we're all happy for it. But start throwing in a story, and our fast-forward buttons start to wear out. Saw III was the beginning of this, and it got worse as time went on, almost totally ruining the series until the disastrous ""Saw 3D"" (now officially retitled ""Saw: The Final Chapter"" because 3D sucks and none of us want it)."
335,5.0,"Must see for any Happy Madison fan.  This unfortunately was more of a sleeper hit than more publicised movies like The Longest Yard, but a garanteed laugh for sandler fans, stoners or gamers. SNL/Happy Madison cameos abound.

Only things missing were no cameos by Sandler and no ""You can do it, rip his freaking head off"" scene.

""My grandma drank all my weed"""
336,2.0,"First of all let me say that I don't usually write negative reviews, I'd much rather tell someone why I LIKED a film than why I thought it sucked, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to make an exception for AvP!

Before I begin, I just want to say that I really, really, REALLY wanted this to be a great film, I mean, SERIOUSLY!!! The original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>&nbsp;is one of my favorite films of all time, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Predator/dp/B000244EMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Predator</a>&nbsp;was pretty damn good as well!

I've never read the AvP comics, but when I heard about HOW they were going to bring the two species together for the film, well, I thought they had a winner on their hands!

Sure, like WHY is there a pyramid buried under the Antarctic? No one would have been able to reach it at ALL except in the last 100yrs or so! And oh yeah, 'til ""Bishop"" started his satellite spinning around up there in orbit to see the heat signature which would bring the Humans, who are a vital ingredient in the process after all... you see where this is going I'm sure, but I could let that slide, I guess. I just had to keep repeating to myself, ""Stop analyzing, stop analyzing, stop analyzing...""

The initial set-up was well handled - it's always nice to see Lance Henriksen doing his thing - and even though you know the majority of the characters are gonna be bug-meat in very short order, they sketch them out serviceably all the same.

We get to see the Predators in orbit preparing for the hunt - Cool! - then the poor unsuspecting humans enter the Pyramid and start messing with stuff you and I just KNOW they shouldn't be messing with! All of a sudden, the pyramid is activated, and we see the captive Alien Queen brought out of suspended animation to lay the eggs of a new generation of homicidal Drones - so freaking cool I thought I was gonna have to change my underwear!!!

And at that point my friends, things start to go down hill... fast.

In the original films, the Alien gestation/birthing process is given to us in all its horrific glory; from Face-Hugger, to Chest-Burster, to fully matured Drone/Soldier, takes at least a couple of days, here, the whole process is telescoped into just a few hours!

The other thing we know about the Alien's from the original films is that they bleed acid, right?! Well... maybe, kinda-sorta... it all depends. As the Predators face off against the Aliens they slice 'n' dice 'em, up close 'n' very personal, with a variety of weapons; sometimes they bleed acid... sometimes they don't.

For instance, there's one scene where an Alien has the end of its tail cut off, and it deliberately whips its severed member at its attacker, splashing him with acid. Then a short while later a Drone has his head sliced in two, and guess what? The head slowly slides apart, revealing nicely detailed interior, but no acid... it should have been spraying all over the place!!! And then there are the Predator weapons; sometimes they're damaged by the acid blood, and guess what, sometimes they're not!

This film so thoroughly ignores or distorts the accepted mythology of the Alien universe that it makes nonsense of the original films.

Henriksens character is ""Charles Bishop Weyland;"" ""The Company,"" in the original Alien films is the ""Weyland-Yutani Corporation."" Logically, therefore, The Company is a descendant of Weyland's operation in the here and now, so surely there would have some information in the company archives of the installation under the Antarctic ice? Wouldn't the sole survivor of the expedition tell her corporate backers the incredible tale of two Alien races fighting to the death in the pyramid?! And although the structure is taken out by one of the Predator mini-nukes, the Queen is, let's say... salvageable. Wouldn't The Company go back to the Antarctic in an attempt to recover Alien samples, instead of trawling through the vast and inhospitable reaches of space?!?!?!

And what about this; the Predators hunt the Aliens as a rite of passage. So, they've faced the most vicious and ferocious creature in the Universe, and are now Adults/Warriors - sorry, I never did get into the Predator mythology. But in the first two Predator films we see them hunting HUMANS; to a Predator, this has got to be the equivalent of those big, tough ""hunters"" who go to deer farms and shoot tame deer!!! Or maybe these Predators are the equivalent of juvenile delinquents; they've stolen the keys to daddy's starship, and are off causing trouble in the local galaxies?!?!?!

Yes I know, nit-pick nit-pick nit-pick!!! But these are such fundamental errors that they really are inexcusable.

But there is some good; the Predators look as menacing as they did in their own films, the Alien's look fantastic - these are Gigers originals, with the ""stove-pipes"" on their backs - and the Queen is amazingly rendered!!! One improvement they've been able to make is that the Alien's tails can now be made to work in a way that simply wasn't possible in the original films. There's a nice sub-plot concerning the surviving Predator taking the surviving Human under his wing, when she proves that she too is a ""Hunter,"" plus an explanation of how the Predators were worshiped as Gods by the ancient, pyramid building peoples of Earth.

This PG-13(!) rated effort is a shambles, especially if you're a fan of the original stories, and Henriksens character is thrown away quite unnecessarily early on in the initial encounters."
337,5.0,"I'd never even heard of this movie until last night when a friend brought it over. He swore it would cheer me up, and not only did it do just that, but I never expected to laugh so hard. An Adam Sandler production (though he himself does not appear in the movie, everyone else you've grown to love from all the Sandler movies is here in good form), Grandma's Boy was so funny that I actually laughed so hard I began to cry. It does have moments of predictability in it, but hey, this is one of those kick-back and watch something funny movies. It's about a guy named Alex who's roommate has been spending their rent at a local ""massage"" parlor, unknown to Alex until the landlord (Rob Schneider, hilariously) evicts them for not paying rent. Alex has nowhere to go, and of course, this is where everything starts to get increasingly amusing. He winds up having to take his grandmother up on her offer to live with her and her 2 roommates. The grandmother is played by the woman who plays Raymond's mom on ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" (forgive me, I can't think of her name) and although I despise that show, she was absolutely fantastic in this. Along with having to live with his grandmother, Alex is a 36 year old video game tester who is creating his own game on the side. Typically, a pretty coworker is introduced to oversee the changes on a current game the company is developing. Alex isn't the only one with a thing for her. J.P., a bizarre programmer known for developing one of the most popular video games around, takes a liking to her too. And he also takes Alex's game and claims it to be his own. But will everything work out for Alex? Ah, I bet you can guess (as I easilly did) but Grandma's Boy is absolutely freaking hilarious. If you enjoy Sandler's movie productions, and you enjoy smoking pot (or at least laughing on the same levels as potheads do) then you will just love this movie. Enjoy!"
338,1.0,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I was largely ambivalent about the first half, and then the second half just went to the crapper (only saving part was some dignity in the last 5 minutes).  Where to begin?  The League of Shadows.  What was the deal with that??  They bring down bloated or decaying empires, yeah, nice gimmic, geez.  Why do they even seek and train Bruce Wayne, they do what they want without him anyways.  And what is with Liam Nielson knowing EVERYTHING about his environment, even about soft ice patches and falling, flaming posts, does he have ESP?  Then there is Bale, who is as stiff as a board. And his love interest, who has the face of a 12 yr. old, and the two have ZERO chemistry (there isn't even an intimate scene between them).  Compare this to Maguire and Dunst in Spiderman, who rule together.  And then there is the whole story, what a mess!  Why on earth would the toxin be mixed with the drugs, then seperated, then put in the water, but then have to be vaporized by a super whizz-bang microwaverator.  Idiotic.

And what about that clown spraying gas in the freaky mask?  First he's a lawyer, then he's a psychiatrist?  And for all the background in the first half of the movie, we really learn nothing about Bruce, except that he's scared of bats.  Big whoop. And everytime batman talks, it's so husky and deep one can hardly understand it, as he growls and shows his teeth like a dog.  What's with that?  This movie is too dark.  It steals

lines, scenes and ideas from the original batman shamelessly, but to less or zero effect.  The second half moves jumbled and confused and there is no fun nor depth nor anything of value.  When they set up a sequel in the final minutes, i could have laughed, who cares!  And the freaking action sequences, one can't see sh#%!  And all those bats flying in at the climax, whatever.  Some suspension

of rationality is required in the comic genre, but this movie goes from serious to ridiculous back and forth that it ends up a blended mess.  Oh yeah, and then Morgan Freeman is in the basement cookin' up the medicine, finding an antidote lickedy-split.  Whatever.  As Chaz Palmieri says in Bullets over Broadway, this movie ""stinks on hot ice"".  Nick would have

killed someone over this production as well."
339,3.0,"I'm not really a Spidey fan or any kind of superhero fan? But I was hoping that in Spider Man 3 would include Spiderman and his Amazing Friends which was a cartoon TV series from the 1980's which included Spiderman best friends Iceman and FireStar.  Iceman who has the ability to freeze anything and everything and FireStar who is a female who can fly and light up fires much like Pyro from XMen but Firestar can fly. I'm not saying they should make a Spiderman 4 because its getting tiresome already. The funny thing is horror movie sequels are always labeled as stupid but I think superhero sequels and action and comedy sequels are the stupidest of all the genre sequels. Horror movies always have a double standard and comedy, action, superhero sequels are never ever labeled as stupid. Hello Star Trek Part 10 or Die Hard Part 4 and James Bond Part 20. Like how many freaking times does Mary Jane need to be saved?"
340,4.0,"I wanted to leave the theater thinking to myself, ""fan-freaking-tastic"", but ""pretty damn awesome"" will have to do.  The critics who say the movie never quite ignites as a barn burner have a point--there's the usual car chase, the obligatory climactic fistfight--but these genre-staple scenes are well-done, and the movie remains engrossing thanks to psychological drama.  The violent scenes are indeed cut in a punch-pulling way that blunts their visceral impact.  Keep in mind that this was likely done to keep the PG-13 rating, not because the director has no sense of action.  Fittingly enough, Batman Begin's most thrilling moment has the Dark Knight dangling a criminal upside down like a yo-yo, interrogating him fiercly. In this moment the transformation to Batman is fully realized in a powerful, entertaining way.  The writing is excellent overall and there are precious few eye-rolling moments (I counted maybe two.)  The comic relief one-liners serve their purpose-they're actually funny!  And sure, Katie Holm's voice has that slightly annoying helium to it, but she plays the part just fine (and is fun to look at.)  So, the movie is not quite the jaw-dropping genre transcender I was looking for.  But it's smart, psychological and full of memorable moments.  At least the bar isn't set impossibly high.  If they keep the same director and tighten things up a bit, the series will be one to treasure.  They need only remember what made this movie work-it bothers to create characters the audience cares about, and it gives those characters good lines to deliver.  ""I'm not going to kill you.  But I don't have to save you."""
341,5.0,"Normally I'd try to write something literal and cohesive to describe the assets of movie I appreciated seeing. Unfortunately I just came out of a theater showing Christopher Nolan's ""Batman Begins"" and that's not going to happen.

Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

Go for other reviews for in-depth analysis of this person's performance or the script's cohesiveness or the breathtaking quality of the cinematography. I'm keeping it simple. It freaking rocks.

I feel like I just rode the best rollercoaster at the fair, and now I can't wait to use the rest of my ride tickets to do the same rollercoaster over and over again. It's been years since an action movie elicited this kind of excitment from me and it feels great.

Will someone please buy George Lucas a ticket to this movie, so he can see how it's done?

This is what movie theaters were made for. Go see it right now. Awesome.

(Is it too early, on opening day, to predict that this movie will be the hands-down blockbuster of 2005? And furthermore, who's ready to go again?)

As a lifelong Batman fan, at 36 I can say that Batman has finally been captured on film. There's one Batman, and his name is Christian Bale. There's one Batman movie, and it's called ""Batman Begins."" Nothing else is remotely in the same league.

Someone get Christopher Nolan on the sequel right now...."
342,4.0,"Being a Harry Potter fan, I liked this movie regardless what coulda/woulda/shoulda been.

In this installment, Harry Potter faces doubts and suspicion from his peers as well as from the Ministry to his proclamation that Lord Voldemort is back.  To Harry's frustration, Dumbledore doesn't help alleviate those doubts and suspicion because he keeps evading Harry.  To keep a tight rein on Hogswarts, the Ministry has sent Delores Umbridge, the Senior Undersecretary, as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  However, she soon appoints herself as the High Inquisitor when she perceives things at Hogswarts as out of control and unnecessary.  Meanwhile, Voldemort and his army are getting stronger.

Like other reviewers, I was surprised to learn that the largest book of the Harry Potter series has been reduced to the shortest movie of the series.  Both the Harry Potter books and movies are formulaic.  However, in this movie, some were deleted (like the quidditch game) and some were ""fast-forwarded"" (like the Christmas break from school & Kreacher).  Naturally, I was a bit disappointed.  However, I still enjoyed the movie very much even though I thought there was more dialogue than action.

However, I just have 3 issues.  First, I enjoyed Umbridge in the book.  Her ""hem, hem"" has caused my friends and I to say that to each other, especially on AIM.  So, I was expecting that line to be the thing of this movie.  Instead, it was just replaced with some regular unoriginal coughs.  Other than that, Umbridge was just freakingly good.  Second, Gwarp looks more like the Jolly Green Giant than anything else.  Third, as the title says 'the order of the phoenix', there was hardly much on the order.

Nonetheless, I liked it even though others felt it was so-so.  I do have to agree that there less action than the previous installment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  I'm already surprised that there is a movie poster for the 6th installment.  So, I'm looking forward to that."
343,5.0,"""Cloverfield"" is a pretty scary movie. It has a bit of everything in it. Horror, action, romance, comedy, drama; it has a lot of genres into it. The film isn't very long, and it may not have a lot to it, but it's still a very-well executed movie. The opening card in the beginning was pretty cool, with that ""government"" and ""case designate Cloverfield"" thing. That was an interesting way to begin the film. It finally rolls into the actual footage. The character development in the beginning was good, and I read  that in the reviews for this movie that the characters were ""one-dimensional"", but in basically every ""found-footage"" film the people are one-dimensional. I bet nobody would be complaining about that if the film had regular camera cuts and weren't found footage.
  Anyway, besides that, after about 18 minutes, the action finally begins with a loud boom. This movie is more intense because it's a large group of people screaming and freaking out. Another thing that makes this film pretty creepy is that it has this ""apocalypse"" feel to it. There's a lot of running and terror in the film. I guess the running made people get motion sickness, but it's their fault that they got motion sickness. They're the ones who saw the movie and they saw that it was done on video camera, and it obviously involves running, so it's basically their fault. I like the extreme shaky camera, and the pixelation, and how in some scenes it would cut back to footage from a month ago for a couple seconds. I also like those freaky-looking spider creatures in that one subway scene. The special effects were also great (it only had a $25 million budget).
  I like how they only show little bits and pieces of the monster throughout the movie and at the end you finally see the whole thing in front of the camera. It's pretty scary looking. The end obviously doesn't explain everything (that's what a lot of people complained about), but I actually think it ended really well, with a cliffhanger. At the last shot in the movie, I like when it cuts back to a month ago and the last line in the movie is ""I had a good day"". The film may not have a lot to it, like I said before. It plays out like this, the ""a month ago"" scene, the party scene, the running scene, the subway scene, the mall scene, hotel scene, and it finally shows the monster and after that there's a couple more minutes. It may sound like a good amount, but for a movie that's not much. I'm not complaining about it, because I think the movie actually played out really well.
  The audio at the way end when you hear ""Help us"" and when it's played backwards, you hear ""It's still alive"", was pretty cool, because it adds on to the cliffhanger effect, and it does make the movie even more creepier. Altogether, I think that even 3 years after the release of Cloverfield, the film is still worth watching again."
344,5.0,"Guillermo del Toro has become one of cinema's true film magicians throughout his career, which started with a steampunk-sprinkled vampire yarn titled Cronos, and has seen films made about ghost stories, super heroes, and giant freaking cockroaches. It is with Pan's Labyrinth, however, that del Toro makes his name known to all. Simply put, this film is perfection, and a true dark fairy tale. It is a film that represents the innocence of a young child, a theme del Toro visited earlier in his 2001 ghost story The Devil's Backbone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Backbone-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00CEIOH3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Backbone (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]. This film is at times ultra-violent and appealing to the child in even the most cynical adult, yet also one of the most visually stimulating films ever made. It's basically Guillermo del Toro's mind poured out into a film canister.

I own the single-disc DVD version of the film, which contains a video prologue by the director as well as del Toro's feature-length audio commentary. It's in the original aspect ratio (1.85.1) and a very good and easy to understand English subtitle translation of the Spanish-language film. The picture is clear and crisp and really shows off the film's visual nature.

A great product representative of an equally great film!"
345,3.0,"This movie will only appeal to slightly psychologically damaged, clever individuals capable of viewing, feeling and experiencing darkness without running for cover or pressing the stop button on the remote. Tony Soprano would love this film.

Visually sumptuous and exceedingly violent, this is a film which assumes the viewer has some knowledge of authentic fairy tales and ancient myths of the distant past where there are no generic and formulaic happy endings featuring (thank God), where Snow White dies as a result of eating the poisoned apple and where Sleeping Beauty never does awaken from her coma.

The extras on Disc 2 will help you understand the film on a deeper level  so if you are ignorant about such things, go ahead and watch Disc 2 first. That way you'll have a far greater appreciation for the film.

Regarding the horrific violence; it's not gratuitous and I loved it.  The aggression and sadism only added o the R-rated appeal of a fairy tale film, like Anne Rice's Beauty Series. Once again, this isn't a movie for dim witted artistically conservative viewers.

Reading the previous reviews, I noticed tons of idiots complaining about the subtitles...are you freaking kidding me? What's the matter with these idiots, can't they read English? If your biggest gripe about this movie is the subtitles then understand this- you're an idiot."
346,3.0,"I can understand the average review being a 4/5 since you should be lenient considering it's a cartoon movie. However, if it were to stand on its own, I would probably give it a 1/5.

There are basically three main problems I have with the movie: Unoriginal, plot is a horrible ripoff of Odyssey, and worst of all, Squidward is missing from the main plot.

By unoriginal, I mean it lacks any unique humor and instead bases the whole comedy aspect on randomness with a touch of the typical Spongebob humor. In addition, all the jokes are horribly lame. For example, at one point in the movie, Plankton comments on how lucky he is to have Karen as his wife, she retorts with she never agreed to the marriage. Aside from that, though, the usual Spongebob plot holes which you could easily ignore on the show becomes overbearing in the movie.

As for the plot being a bad ripoff of the Odyssey, well, that's obvious. There was NOTHING in their journey. The most dangerous situation they faced was at Shell City. In the other parts, they passed incredibly easily. They literally had helped from the things that were supposed to make their journey dangerous and epic.

The last and worst problem is immediately noticeable when Squidward refuses to join Spongebob and Patrick on their journey. Patrick is incredibly funny, but his random acts of stupidity simply does not hold a candle to Squidward's stoicism. He's the best freaking character in the whole show! Without him, I wouldn't even watch the show! I couldn't believe the creators of the movie decided to leave him out! They must have been on some type of hallucinogen to think that the movie would be better without him.

Finally, this is a small problem, but it's a problem that occurs frequently and eventually ruins the movie too. The creator cops out far too often. By ""cop out"", I mean they take the easy way out. Rather than thinking up unique approaches, they take the easy path and be unimaginative. For example, in one situation where Spongebob and Patrick faced danger, instead of imaginatively thinking an approach to how Spongebob and Patrick may get out unharmed. The creators decides that the duo entrances the danger and the danger helps them escape. THAT is horrible! The same problem occur at the end too! Instead of thinking up something unique, the creators employs the worst ending ever!

Overall, you may want to see this movie if you're a huge fan, but if you're not, then I wouldn't recommend it at all."

348,4.0,"Just saw I Am Legend.  I enjoyed it.  I had heard years ago that they were going to remake Omega Man with Arnold Swarzenegger, and guess what? A bunch of zombie movies started springing up all over the place (Dawn of Dead remake, 28 days, Shaun of Dead, etc), but I never heard anything about Omega Man again---until, I heard that they WERE actually going to do it, but now call it by its original title, I Am Legend, and the biggest box office star in the world, Will Smith, would be the lead.  If they would have made this film back during Arnold's heyday, I think it would have been successful.  But, later on, not so much, BUT, with Smith in it right now there is no doubt this movie will be a huge moneymaker.  The comparisons to Omega Man with one of my all-time favorites Charlton Heston?  Well, I like that the ""creatures"" are more intelligent in Omega Man, not just pure monsters out for food.  I think most people agree that out of Heston's ""post-apocolyptic sci-fi trilogy--Planet Apes, Soylent Green, and Omega) Omega hasn't weathered as well.  But, I think some of the best scenes in Legend are almost taken directly from Omega Man.  The driving alone through the deserted city, and some of the ""cracking up"" scenes with Heston, especially the telephone/booth scene is better that Smith freaking out about the empty city.  The ending scenes are quite powerful from both films, but I prefer Heston's ending as well.  So, I guess if you like scary/horror/action films, you should check out Legend.  And then maybe you should watch the Omega Man and the original with Vincent Price.  IF you don't like this stuff, then don't waste your time."
349,5.0,they have 3 . the british vershion you sent me by mistake . and I kept for the great grandchildrens house had all 3.

350,5.0,"Please note that I did in fact grow up with watching and loving the Tim Burton Batman movies. After atrocities called Batman Forever and Batman & Robin, I convinced myself the only good Batman stories will either be animated or in comic books. In my opinion, the best Batman in visual format is the Animated Series from the 1990s. Kevin Conroy will always be the true voice of the Batman, and Mark Hamil will and always be the Joker.  However, for a theatrical and more realistic view of the Legend of the Dark Knight, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.

I would write a long review of why I think my title sums it up, but I'll just go by the stars:
1 star for being the amazing Christopher Nolan directed sequel of my favorite comic book superhero.
1 star for the amazing performances of all of the actors and actresses. Yes even the Christian Bale growl I liked. What? you have to mask your voice! Shush! He's Batman! grrrr! Heath Ledger will forever be remembered as this Joker. More so than Jack Nicholson (oh no the blasphemy oh!)If the Joker was to exist, this has got to be it. I couldn't take my eyes off of him watching this at the theater.
1 star for how this was made. Barley any CGI. This movie was just created so freaking well.
1 star that this is what a Blu-Ray disc is all about: 720 and 1080p resolution High Definition Sound quality.
1 star for.. I'm not sure, it's a very #$%@ing great suspenseful action movie.

I would pay whatever price for this movie if I don't already have it. Well, not a Best Buy or Barnes 'n Noble new release price, but $19.99 or $9.99 totally worth owning one of the best Batman and Blu-Ray releases ever!"
351,1.0,"If America honestly loves this movie as much as it seems they do, then we are all screwed.

""Transformers"" is absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in years, and yet I can't count the positive reviews I read for it, or the number of people who recommended it to me--people, I might add, that I will never, ever, ever, take the advice of again.

This movie is the story of living robots who come to earth in search of a device they can't decide on a name for--sometimes they call it The Cube, sometimes the All-Spark--the screenwriters never quite worked that out.  Some of the robots are kind to humans, others want to destroy them.  They turn into cars and trucks.  They fight.  There's a bunch of inane subplots about a boy and his first car, a forced love story, lawn jokes, a girl and her felonious past, a soldier and his baby girl, a bunch of hackers, and a range of insulting stereotypes that lay the director's thoughts bare: ""Oh, you know what's really funny?  Black people!  Acting black!  That's hilarious!""  (This movie is a case study in ridiculous and demeaning stereotypes.)

The movie's director, Michael Bay, is one of the worst filmmakers working today, the man who brought us the interminable ""Pearl Harbor"" and the inexcusably sappy ""Armageddon.""  I thought even he couldn't totally ruin the potentially campy fun of a movie about giant killer robots from space, though...but he did.

This movie's dialogue is so bad, particularly the cheesy sound bites given to the robots themselves, that I would not be surprised if ninety percent of it was made up by the actors on the spot.  Seriously.  The action is more banal and unexciting than the pointless action scenes in the last two Matrix films, the story and characterizations are straight out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and the plot is almost nonexistent and completely nonsensical.  You are basically guaranteed not to care about what happens to any of the characters, and the whole thing feels absolutely eternal.  I almost turned it off more than once.

The incredibly self-conscious and expository conversations between the transformers frequently reminded me of the equally bad ""Garbage Pail Kids"" movie, which was also a misbegotten film based on '80s collectibles.  And then, get this: the robots are from the planet CYBERTRON.  Are you kidding me?  Did a nine-year-old write this?  And I don't care if it is based on the toys, you took liberties elsewhere, take the liberty to make some sense and not sound like a total moron.  Change it.

Also, several scenes are supposed to be set in the Middle East, but it could not be more obvious they were actually filmed in New Mexico, because they have freaking Shiprock in the background; I mean seriously, if you're going to use the American Southwest to double as Qatar, try not to feature one of the region's most recognizable landmarks in it.

Criticizing this movie is too easy, though.  The script--there can't be a script--is generally merely simplistic dialogue such as ""No, no, no, no, no, no, no!,"" (my thoughts exactly) or just blatant exposition.  There are sex jokes and soft adult language for the teen crowd and for all those thirty-year-old virgins stuck in their childhood, but no one ever dies or gets hurt and most of the picture seems to be catering to grade schoolers.

This is sci-fi at its worst, movies at their lowest, greed and pointlessness at their most rampant.  And it's not even entertaining, really--because I really would forgive a lot of it if it was.  It's tedious.  It's excruciatingly boring at points, almost always unbearably cheesy, never funny, never tense, and it is a total waste of what could have at least been some fun eye-candy.

I am being honest with you, when I say, this is a terrible film, very possibly the worst of the year.  Don't watch it.  Don't trust anyone that tells you it's great.  It's ""Herbie the Love Bug"" meets the Power Rangers meets Michael Bay meets a freaking TOY, and it follows a recipe that nothing good can possibly come from."
352,1.0,"I can't believe anyone likes this movie.  So lame.  5 autobots vs 5 decepticons.  Wow.  Epic.  The robots were horribly designed.  I could barely tell they were robots after they transformed (a process that appears like it should take several hours).  And autobots are f'ing buicks and oldsmobiles.  C'mon, Jazz is a freaking pontiac instead of a porsche?  Starscream was okay, and it was nice to use the original Optimus' voice, but those are about the only redeeming features of this typical Michael Bay crapfest.  Bring on the 1080p release of the animated masterpiece, ""Transformers: The Movie!"""
353,5.0,"When the time finally came for this film to come out, the euphoria of the hype had suddenly left my system and thus the all to familiar feeling of dread overcame me. Part of me told me 'not to worry, its Transformers. How can it suck?' Nevertheless I dove into the shallow pit of the abyss and plunked my bottom in a seat unoccupied by bubblegum and the movie began.

[The Plot]:

The plot is true to Transformers mythos; Two factions (Autobots and Decepticons) battling over one powerful source necessary to either's agenda and survival. Immeasurable years ago, an artifact known only as the ""All Spark"" created the planet Cybertron and with it the life forms that would be known as ""Transformers"". For time there was peace, but through a series of unseen events, a civil war breaks out and consumes the world of Cybertron. The Autobots launch the All Spark into the farthest reaches of space, in hopes that the Decepticons would never find it.

But fate had other plans, it seems...

Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is on a mission to get his very first car; Bobby Boliva (Bernnie Mac) --- despite not knowing the origin of the vehicle --- sells him a rusty and faded 1977 Chevrolet Camaro, which ironically turns out an Robot in disguise. With a wreck of a car in hand, Sam attempts to win the heart of the high-school beauty, Mikeala Banes (Megan Fox), a longtime crush of his. However, one night Sam wakes up to his car being 'stolen' and ends up bearing witness to his vehicle transforming into a giant robot. Things from there, don't go so well for Sam.

Meanwhile, the Decepticons finally pinpoint the location of their desired target and his Ancestor's [Archibald Witwicky] glasses. Sam and Mikaela find themselves caught in the middle of an age old war that will decide the fate of their and the Transformer's planet alike. Thus, the movie introduces a frenzied host of characters, Decepticon, Autobot, and Human alike. All of which play more or less important roles in the film.

[Overview]:

Sufficed to say, Transformers, is one amazing movie, by far the best film released in 2007. Michael Bay has finally hit his highest mark and is nearly welcomed by Transformer Fans and general audiences alike. He, along with help of others, bring this movie to life in such an unimaginable way, I was left reeling from shock and amazement. The action sequences are absolutely stunning and true to Michael Bay's style of direction. The very moment Barricade transforms and Bumblebee comes racing out of the smoke to the instrumental version of ""Pretty Handsome Awkward"", the entire theater, including myself, went wild. Jason Broune movies aside, it was like the freaking revitalization of the Car Chase, man!

The CGI utilized in this film blows everything else past and present, out of the water. The way the Transformers seamlessly blend in with real world environment was stunning, notably during the scene in which the Autobots stand atop the observatory, debating over Bumblebee and the fate of the human race. They moved flawlessly, and rapidly during battles. Certainly a Oscar worthy animation, though I doubt the suits would even give it an honorable mention. On that note, the revamp of the overall look of the Transformers, was a smart move on Michael Bay's part. Illustrator, Ben Procter, creates stunningly realistic models of our heroes and villains, that are equally majestic and menacing in their own way.

The emotional impact, coupled with the score composed by Steve Jablonsky is simply breath-taking. He knows what mofits or themes to use in every scene. The emotional range of his music if felt in sequences using themes like ""Arrival"", ""Bumblebee's capture"" (a powerful moment between Sam and his guardian), and the major and most original theme I've heard this year, ""Decepticons"". Thankfully, though, Jablonsky is not all action and drama. A quirky theme, via ""Sam at the Lake"" is a joy to listen to. Overall, it mirrors the humor and drama, along with militaristic atmosphere of Bay's previous films as well as Hans Zimmer's other compositions, but never detracts from the fact that its Jablonsky own composition. I totally recommend picking up the score, its an excellent standalone.

[Voice Acting]:

The opening narrative sets the mood for the entire movie and to hear Optimus Prime's (Peter Cullen) voice echoing around me was like listening to an old friend you hadn't seen in ages. He certainly sounds different from when I last heard him (2003 officially), wiser I suppose, but I'm not complaining. At first, I was disappointed that didn't use the equally charismatic Gary Chalk of Beast Wars Fame (he was my favorite before I remembered Cullen), but when watching this movie, I understand why Peter Cullen was recruited to reprise his role as the sympathetic leader of Auotbots. His deliverly of the quote ""Sorry, my bad"", had me doing a double-take, big time.

When introduced, it takes a while to get used to the voice actors for the other Autobots. I found it ironic that I immediately took to Jess Harnell as Barricade but took my time getting used to him as Ironhide. I loved Robert Foxworth as Ratchet, his gravely-like tone just suited the character so well. Darius McCrary as Jazz was the one I had the hardest time accepting. It wasn't his acting, that was fine, it was more or less his accent --- ""What's crackin', little bitches?"" had me frowning immediately ---, was more akin to the 'ghetto accent' I've heard all my life (no racism implication intended). I wondered why they didn't use ""Scatman"" Crothers, until my parents informed me that he had died in 1986. I felt kinda silly then.

But on my second viewing, I was more or less used to McCary as Jazz, it suits the personality overall. Mark Ryan as Bumblebee, which is only heard for a few seconds, threw me for a loop. Given his seemingly energetic and youthful behavior --when he's not kicking Deceptichops --- supposedly based on Michael J. Fox's performance in Back to the Future, I thought the youngest Autobot would've sounded like Judd Nelson's Hot Rod in the 1986 movie. Instead you hear this cultured, aged voice coming out his repaired voice box. It takes some getting used to, but in retrospect, I think it suits his character quite well now.

When concerning the Decepticons the voices used are few and sometimes not heard long enough to judge properly. Hugo Weaving as Megatron, though distorted, suits the more menacing version of Megatron. The first time I heard him, I couldn't believe it was him. However, there are moments in which you can hear Weaving's accent in lines like ""Is is fear or Courage that Compells you?"". He was the perfect counterpart to Cullen's Prime. Charlie Adler as Starscream was a decent portrayal, though like Ryan, has a few lines, so I cannot properly gauge his performance beyond 'decent'. Reno Wilson as Frenzy, was entirely enjoyable. From his indecipherable gibbering, and high-pitched screams, I just couldn't get enough of him, he was a riot! And lastly, Jamie Wood .... as, well, Bonecrusher, makes a perfect guttural growl for the violent Decepticon, given he has no lines whatsoever. He sent shivers down my spine, that much is for certain. The electronics provided for Blackout, Scorponok, and Devastator, were only just too cool.

[Live Action Acting]:

With Shia LaBeouf's enormous success in the movies, I am simply amazed by how far he's come since Even Stevens. As Sam Witwicky, his comedic and dramatic performances shine through and were simply enjoyable. His interaction with the CGI Bumblebee and the Autobots/Decepticons was utterly convincing. You could actually sense a relationship between him and his non-existent counterparts. His chemistry with Megan Fox was believable, quirky even, at times.

Megan Fox herself defies the limitations of her role as Mikeala Banes, time and time again, dramatically, comedic-wise, and especially in action sequences. I've never liked Josh Duhamel, but as Capt. William Lennox, I can easily say its the only time I found myself enjoying his presence on the screen. Tyrese Gibson as Sgt. Epps, was just as likeable, especially. Thankfully, his performance keeps away from Will Smith-like characterizations in movies like ""Independence Day"" and ""Bad Boys.""

Jon Voight and John Turturro as Secretary of Defense John Keller and Agent Simmons played decent government officials; Turturro was a riot, Voight's accent reminded me far too much of our President (who even makes a mock-appearance in the film). Rachel Taylor and Anthony Anderson as Maggie Madsen and Glen Whitmann, made decent characters you would've liked to see more of. Anderson made more of a convincing Hacker than Talyor did an Annalist, though the way she rambled things off in her Aussie Accent, which I'm glad they let her use, is simply a joy to listen to.

Others like Kevin Dunn, Julie White (Ron and Judy Witwicky), Michael O'Neill (Tom Banachek, The head of Sector 7), and Bernie Mac (Bobby Bolivia) were all convincing in their contrasting roles that either moved to the film forward or just made you laugh. Even Amaury Nolasco (Figueroa) with his quirky Spanish speaking character and Zack Ward (First Sgt Donnelly), who gets killed yet again, were enjoyable characters in their brief appearances.

----

All in all, if your looking for the ultimate Summer Movie, Michael Bay's Transformers is the one to watch. If not, stick to the movies before and after its advent. --- [a 5 out of 5].

Theatrical Review (For: 7/6/07 and 7/19/07 viewings)]: Written: 8/1/07"
354,3.0,"It's a story that's not complicated to follow and it's the type of movie you would watch while unwinding on a Friday night. A quick summary: Jane meets Ray, this supposedly romantic, sensitive man who is going through a really rough patch with his girlfriend. They get involved, she falls head over heels in stupid love with him, they plan to move in together, and just like that without warning, he bails. Hurt, confused, and now living with her womanizing coworker, Eddie, Jane begins an obsessive ""study"" into human male behavior after reading a newspaper article and names her study ""New Cow Theory."" Adopting a pseudo identity as a sex and relationship expert, Jane has an article on New Cow published with the magazine her friend works for, and the country eats it up.

Some things I like about it: I like how the film shows that some people, like Ray, are two-faced. They show a heartfelt, genuine exterior in order to get what they want, and when they have gotten it, they let their true colors show that they're spineless, thoughtless cowards. This contrasts with Eddie, who, although a jerk on the surface, he is at least honest about his intentions, gives no false pretenses, and we are shown that he is so callous because he was badly burned by his previous relationship, if not more so than Jane. I enjoy juxtapositions like this between characters, and I thought it was played out well, especially with Greg Kinnear's and Hugh Jackman's performances. I also appreciated the fact that Jane admits on live television that she was ultimately wrong about her theory at the end of the film and that not all men are like Ray, which, let's face it, is very true. Moreover, Ray gets his comeuppance at the end of the film, or at least, we are hinted at it.

Some things I didn't like: The pacing felt a bit clunky and I was hoping for more romantic development between Jane and Eddie than there was so it didn't seem as left field at the end of the film. I also wish what happened with Eddie and his ex-girlfriend had been explained too so we would get to understand where he was coming from better. Then there was just Jane's personality. She annoyed me in some parts with her wishy-washiness and obsessive behavior over her broken relationship with Ray (to the point where it was downright childish and creepy), but as I read the book the movie was based after--""Animal Husbandry""--I can see that they made an effort to make her a sympathetic character in the movie and appreciate it. The book incarnation of Jane is an extremely insipid, shallow, tunnel-visioned woman who just leaves me thinking ""Well, no freaking dur lady"" every so often. What made her think hooking up with a taken guy who was verbally vomiting all over his fiancee behind her back was a good idea is still beyond me.

Anyway, I thought the movie was mildly entertaining and I would maybe watch it again with a friend who had never seen it before, and I would watch it with my mother because she did like it. One final thought I have to add is that this is just another one of Hugh Jackman's early films that serves as a prime example that he is a highly talented and versatile actor. It's a shame that since his debut as Wolverine in the X-Men movie franchise, it seems that he's been typecast."

Plus, Guinevere (Gwenwyfar, or something in the book) was as much of a total freaking b*%^^%ch in the movie as in the book.  You want her to be killed at the stake or something.  MMMMM steak,,,,

More importantly, it interests our son only episodically, although more so than some of the worst (see Zen Baby, for example, Zen as in z-z-z-z-z).  My own view is that the concept supposedly underlying this video gets parental fans hyper-ventilating (""I know, let's inject him with lots of Mozart and repetition of simple words and he'll be a freaking genius!"").  But our son hears plenty of Mozart and simple words the natural way.  Get this video if nobody around your house has time to actually tell your child what a ""ball"" or ""cat"" is and you never play the music of Mozart.  You can get it all in one package right here.  Relatively speaking, though, this is helium compared to the Einstein series's U235."
364,5.0,my best friend loves godsmack he has all of their cds and he just got this one and now he has all of the godsmack dvd including smack this and changes and he brought godsmack live for me to watch and it was good maybe not as good as changes dvd but pretty close and Godsmack is freaking awesome
365,1.0,"EPICENTER commits one of the worst crimes I've ever seen commited by a film and it's creators. What's that crime you ask? Stealing! I don't blame the screenwriter. I don't blame Gary Daniels (I mean for a ""B"" action star he usually makes decent ""B"" action fare) but I do blame whoever used the scenes from METRO with Eddie Murphy and the train sequences from MONEY TRAIN and the elevator scene from SPEED. Don't beleieve me? Watch this, then watch METRO and the other movies mentioned. I thought I was the only one who would notice this but apparently I am not. It's that freaking obvious! The whole beginning chase scene is from METRO. They added two bad guy characters to focus on just because Eddie Murphy and Michael Rappaport were their stand ins. I think it's absolute bull---- that the stunt men for METRO and teh special effcets people for SPEED and MONEY TRAIN didn't get paid twice. I mean, technically they worked on this stupid waste of celluloid and didn't even receive credit (not that they'd want it) for it. This film is ridiculous! Stealing scenes from another movie is, in my opinion, the laziest, cheapest, worst thing that could be done in a film. I've already seen METRO - why would I want to see the same exact chase again? I mean, if you don't have the money to make your own movie then don't make it and like director Robert Rodriguez said, if you've written something in your script that you cant afford to shoot...rewrite the script!
Skip this movie -- It isn't worth the one star..."
366,5.0,"With a movie that was originally titled ""Squelch,"" I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Would this be good? Or would this be another campy teen horror flick? This movie is really AWESOME.
This movie stars Paul Walker as Louis and Steve Zahn as his troublemaker brother Fuller. Fuller gets the genius idea to ""prank call"" someone on a CB radio. Turns out the guy on the other end REALLY hates prank calls. One of the cool things about his movie is that none of these characters have cell phones. I don't have a cell phone because I can't afford one, and it's nice to see that these guys don't have a cell phone simply because they couldn't afford one either.
I was gripping my chair during the chase scenes and freaking out over little things-- like when the truck driver loudly plays a fifties type song on the radio as he's trying to find them in a cornfield.
The alternate endings are especially pleasing. One of which is 29 minutes long (which was the original ending) and MUCH MUCH different than the one used in the movie. There are also three other endings, all fairly similar, but with twists on the same scenario. Another special feature is listening to the other voices that were intended for the truck drivers voice... you'll know why they chose Ted Levine for the voice after you hear the other two.
This a great movie, a fantastic DVD, and just an overall great time to watch. Get ready for the ride of your life!"
367,2.0,"Let me save everyone some money. I'm a 31 year old who's desperately trying to learn Spanish. I saw a few clips on YouTube. This DVD definitely had potential. It has A LOT of helpful information (and the female presenter is so freaking hot). However, the background music is so annoying. It detracts from the actual lesson (Wouldn't salsa music make more sense)? And to make matters worse, the background graphics are borderline nauseating.

Don't waste your money"
368,5.0,I mean come on. It's freaking Donnie Darko.
369,4.0,"I'm still debating how I feel about this movie. I know that I'll have to watch it a couple more times to pick up on all the little things and connections. Overall, for now, I appreciate schizo Donnie as the hero - giving his own life for the sake of others - in the end which is really the beginning and the end. Oh, and obviously the guy in the bunny costume, Frank, was really freaking freaky. I'm glad he eventually takes off the suit, though, because that would have given me nightmares if I hadn't known who or what was really inside it. Biggest surprise - seeing Patrick Swayze. I didn't know he was in this movie before I started watching. He was good, and it made me sad seeing him again. Still, I'm glad he's got another good film credit. Yes, I do think this was a good movie, even though I don't fully understand it all yet. I'm still intrigued by the time travel elements. I love time travel in movies and the way it messes with my mind. Oh, and favorite line so far - Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. This movie has some excellent weirdos.

Maggie Gyllenhaal played Jake Gyllenhaal's sister, and that was neat to see the real-life sibling actors acting together. This was Jake's first major film I believe (not sure), and he was excellent as dark, troubled, sleep-walking schizophrenic Donnie. Jake has continued to get better and better over the years, and, I have to add, hotter and hotter. I patiently await the day he's up for an Oscar.

Next time I watch this, I'm sure I'll have more comments."
370,4.0,"I remember watching this movie when it first came out on the theaters in 2001 and I was very moved by it. Needless to say, there was no one in the room with me and very few people heard of Donnie Darko during that time. I moved to England in 2004 and the movie was a huge cult success. It obviously got there much later as most movies do, but it put the movie into the spotlight.
Donnie, a mentally ill teenager starts to get visions of a giant bunny rabbit who warns him that the end of the world is coming soon. He suddenly is given a book that describes his experiences so he tries to change the future by changing the past. Good performances, great soundtrack, original and remarkable script make this movie one of the most representative of its decade. The director's cut is more slow paced and makes things easier to understand. Here you will find all the deleted scenes for the first Dvd release,some extra special effects,and a slightly altered soundtrack. The special features have this Donaldson character who is elected as The number one fan of the movie...He is quite creepy and funny at the same time, seeing him kissing Richard Kelly and freaking everyone he meets out is pretty amusing. This dvd is certainly worth buying."
371,5.0,"This film is at turns hilarious, sad, and frightening.  Donnie is a confused adolescent, perhaps mentally ill, who is either communing with a vision, freaking out, dreaming, or being manipulated.  The best thing is that all the connections are never really explained, so it is left to the viewer to interpret it.  That means it can be viewed over and over, which it will in our house because the acting is excellent and the cinematography is beautiful.  And it does not conform to the usual feel-good junk that comes out of hollywood.

Warmly recommended."
372,5.0,"Kevin Spacey first snapped my attention as Mel Proffit on the CBS telly series WISEGUY.  He played a drug dealing, jet-setting, psycho that went around killing people, freaking out and saying things like ""only the toes knows..."".  Well, if the toes knew, they must have know what a big star Spacey would be in just a few years.  He choses films that stretch his untouchable range in the Usual Suspects, the serial killer in 7, the gentle soul claiming to be an alien in the wonderfully moving K-Pax to this gem of a film The Shipping News.  This was a gentle, loving, heart-lifting book, so I feared when it came to the screen, all the quirkiness that made it so special might be lost.  Instead, it is beautiful realised under Spacey brilliant performance, backed by the ever eternal and radiant Juliana Moore and the utterly marvellous Judy Dench and the solid Pete Postlethwaite, and another super tour de force for the ever solid Scott Glen.
This is a story that touches your heart, the way so many of Hollywood films fail to do, and leave you smiling at the end, and maybe even leaves you missing these near friends you have come to love.  It is good to see films like that do so well, just a shame there is not more.
It is brilliantly written, with all the quirkiness you find in a small knit community, the isolation tend to make the locals revel in their bizarre personalities and even sort of wear them like a badge.  I have seen this same 'wee tight isle' in Scotland and in Ireland and small towns in the US.  Everyone knows everyone - knows the history as far back as it goes.  The past is not so distant, where people with the sight is just an everyday occurrence.
Kevin Spacey plays a gentle soul, driven by an overbearing, likely abusive father to believing he was nothing.  He felt the world pasted him by until Petal jumped into his car.  Petal is typical Hussy type, a lass out for fun and little else.  For the first time, Kevin's character feels that he no invisible.  Petal gets pregnant, have a baby girl, Bunny, and then precedes to live life just as she always had, with good time guys and honky-tonks.  She checks in long enough to upset Spacey, and pat the kid on the head.  When the child is about 8, she slips away with child in tow, running away with the latest boyfriend.  If that is not upsetting enough, Spacey's father and mother decided life is the pits and check out.
In the midst of finding out Petal died in a car crash with her boyfriend, but sold Bunny to a black-market child adoption ring for six thousand dollars, Spacey's long lost aunt,(Dench) turns up to steal her brothers ashes.  (Won't reveal what she does with them!!  She encourages Spacey to take his daughter and move back to New Foundland to where his family comes from.  Once there his daughter shows tendencies of 'the sight' but it is taken in stride.
Scott Glen owns the local paper and hired Spacey to write the shipping news.  He fears failure in this, since Petal just reinforced his worthlessness instilled by his father.  However, instead, he comes into his own.  He also begins a tentative romance with Moore, with his daughter taking to her son, who suffered brain damage during birth.
Spacey faces his demons and learns to heal, as Dench confronts her own secrets and shames, and loves to move on.
The scenery is gorgeous, raining and foggy ( sorry I am a Scot and love a bit of the wet and fog makes me want to walk in it forever.  This captures the moodiness, though the snow in May does make one shudder!)
This is just one beautiful movie.  You cannot say anything higher."

374,1.0,"Has anyone EVER seen a freaking a movie that was like ""real life""? Even the movies that are BASED on real life get stuck with all sorts of crap to embellish the plot.

My son and I watched ""Panic Room"" the other night. At first, I thought that it would be a pretty good flick. That thought faded away rather quickly. This room was supposed to be impenetrable. By the end of the movie, there were more ways to disable the occupants of that ""impenetrable"" room than there are gates at Disney World.

Here they had a room that was supposed to be surrounded by concrete and steel yet the neighbor heard the screaming from the room and complained to police about it. The air system was compromised. There was a hole in the wall that led directly outside, wires from the outside could be reached from the inside. It was a freaking joke.

I would rather take my chances face to face than depend on a room like that. Whoever wrote the script should be barred from ever writing again. The only good thing that we got out of the movie was that we agreed it was stupid. We were just sitting there talking about how stupid it was and before we knew it, it got even MORE stupid. On a scale of 1-10, I would give it a 2. On the stupid scale, I would give it a 9. It wasn't totally awful, but it certainly was not good. The only thing that saved it from the bottom of the barrel was the cast, and they should be ashamed for acting in such a piece of crap.

I would rate it slightly better than getting a tooth pulled.

But, I did really like the end. You know, the part when the movie finally stops."
375,1.0,"I couldn't make it passed the first 15 minutes. This movie is visually as bad as the final Jason Borne movie. For crying out loud, has this director never heard of a freaking Steady-Cam?! Cutting rapidly from angle to angle, extreme close-ups, high contrast lighting that you can only catch quick glimpses of the action due to all of the blackness on the screen, etc....

What a horrible cinematic experience. No matter how good the script or the acting is, if one must work to puzzle out the images on the screen, it takes all of the fun out of watching the movie. I want to suspend reality and become engrossed in the story. These machine-gun like visuals never let you relax enough to do that. Boo!"
376,5.0,"Too much to say, and sadly, not matter how flowery or refined my words will try to be, they will never do justice to the greatness of this show.

I'm a recent addition to the 'Scapers' movement, meaning that unfortunately, while the series was on Sci-fi, I was unable to watch it. Mostly because I was away in College, and their cable package did not include the Sci-fi channel.  I always did hear good things about it, but I never got to see this beautifully done series.

I'm a lover of Sci-fi in general, and after having purchased the Babylon 5 series, I started looking around for other great Sci-fi series to buy.  Imagine my pleasant surprise when I saw that Farscape was now available as box sets- I was jumping up and down in glee, when I realized I could watch the entire run of the series-another reason to love DVDS.

Needless to say, I bought the entire Farscape run in one swoop (It was probably the best half grand that I've ever spent). I also got the Peacekeeper wars.

The moment the first episode began to play, I was sucked immediately into the world of Farscape, I knew then, that I would never regret buying this series.  The quality of it was just so amazing, considering that it was a TV show. The characters were interesting and fluid, Rygel was just so freaking funny, I always forgot he was a puppet- the Henson company did a tremendous job on animating him and giving him a personality and character of his own.

And then, there was Claudia Black.  She captivates me like no other female character in Sci-fi has ever done.  Her eyes, her mannerisms, and the way she acts, Aeryn Sun is the archetype of the sci-fi female heroine.

I'm also, for the most part, a hopeless romantic, so the instant chemistry you see between Aeryn and John told me that this was going to be a Sci-fi romance for the ages.  They way the two actors play off each other makes you get involved in their struggle to understand each other, and their own initial denial to what they are both feeling is just so enticing.  The fact that Aeryn is a Sebacean, an alien who looks a lot like a human, makes their interaction all the more interesting.  She's a genetically bred warrior, a PeaceKeeper, who has been raised in a society where she only knows how to fight but not feel.  It must have been exasperating to John, trying to figure her out- no more so, when in one episode he asks her, ""what about compassion?""  It's not a surprise that there is no Sebacean word for compassion, as Aeryn tells him, and that she's never felt the feeling he's trying to describe.

So far, I've only completed season 1, but already I'm seeing how John's humanity is starting to affect Aeryn, and how maybe, they'll find that they aren't so different after all, and that love can cross all boundaries....

I'm sad that this show only had 4 seasons, and while I'm glad it got closure with the follow-up mini series, The Peacekeeper Wars, I do hope that they will make either a feature film, or somehow, someway, get funding for season 5.  It's been almost 2 years since it went off air, I think, but you never know, sometimes miracles do happen.  Although it's getting harder and harder to believe it will, since Ben Browder and Claudia Black are now working on Stargate Sg1 (another show I love, but it's not the same.)

Buy this series, if you have any love for sci-fi, you won't be disappointed.  Yes, the boxsets are expensive compared to other shows, but you know what? After seeing season 1, and hoping that by supporting Farscape with my wallet so that somehow Farscape comes back in some form or another, I would gladly pay the price ADV is asking."
377,1.0,"I've seen several recent films based upon the lives of prolific serial killers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bundy/dp/B00283QEKW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bundy</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/B-T-K/dp/B001TWT06I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">B.T.K.</a>, etc.), and none of them have been any good.  Dahmer is no exception; in fact, it is worse than the others.  I'm afraid I can't buy into any of the artsy-fartsy, pseudo-intellectual spin this film gets in some quarters.  Quite frankly, all I saw was a really bad movie.  I simply don't see how you can present any kind of story about Jeffrey Dahmer without at least alluding to the fact that the man freaking ate his victims.  All the psychological nonsense this movie throws your way with its endless flashbacks and fictionalized recreation of dialogue and events is patently useless because it ignores the most telling and significant of his psychological problems.  My problem is not the fact that this film is really just a character study of a troubled young man; rather, it's the fact that it's a very bad character study.

I'm afraid I really have nothing good to say about this film.  I wasn't really impressed by Jeremy Renner's performance as Dahmer, I despised the constant flashback loops (which I consider the sole domain of weak directors) throughout the story, and I thought the ambiguous ending pretty much encapsulated everything that was wrong with the entire film.  This is a film almost wholly lacking in substance.

Obviously, with the whole cannibalism thing totally off the table, this film barely registers on the blood and gore meter.  I don't have a problem with that, especially since I was already well aware of the exceedingly disturbing nature of Jeffrey Dahmer's murderous acts.  I do have a problem with the fact that this film really only hints at the scope and depravity of all the murders.  If you already know a good bit about Jeffrey Dahmer, you won't learn anything new in this film.  If you know nothing about Dahmer going in, you won't know much more about him at the end - but you may think you have some insight into his character.  That, in my opinion, is the crux of this film's many problems."
378,3.0,"Audiences' fascination with the occult, along with relaxed production codes, led to a slew of Satanic themed films produced in the late 1960s thru the 1970s, including such movies as Rosemary's Baby (1968), Satan's Skin (1971) aka The Blood on Satan's Claw, The Exorcist (1973), Race with the Devil (1975), The Devil's Rain (1975), The Omen (1976), and this early entry titled The Brotherhood of Satan (1971), featuring L.Q. Jones (Major Dundee, Hang 'Em High, The Wild Bunch), who shared writing and producing credits.  Directed by Bernard McEveety, who worked on any number of television series including ""Rawhide"", ""Branded"", and ""Hawaii Five-O"" to name a few, the film also features Strother Martin (Cool Hand Luke, The Wild Bunch, Slap Shot), Alvy Moore (""Green Acres""), who co-produced with Jones, Charles Bateman (""Manhunt""), Ahna Capri (The Girls on the Beach), Charles Robinson (Sugar Hill), and Geri Reischl (I Dismember Mama), probably best known for replacing Eve Plumb as her character Jan Brady on the spin-off series ""The Brady Bunch Hour"" (1977).

As the film begins we witness (sort of) a family in a car being crushed by a tank, followed by a children's birthday party.  After this we see three people, a man, woman, and a little girl, having a picnic, one that's effectively spoiled once it starts raining (I don't know what they're freaking out about, especially since they're all wearing bathing suits).  Anyway, the man, named Ben (Bateman), his daughter K.T. (Reischl), and his girlfriend Nicky (Capri), whose got some of the biggest fake eyelashes I've ever seen, make a beeline for the car leading to a ridiculously lengthy driving sequence.  As the trio approaches a nearby town, they see the crushed car from the beginning of the film (and its bloody contents), rush into town for help, only to find much craziness (the townsfolk don't seem all that receptive to outsiders).  They take off, and soon after Ben crashes the car, forcing the trio to hoof it back to Nuttyville, only to discover some nastiness in the form of a pair of recently murdered people in a farmhouse.  Ben eventually finds help in the form of the local sheriff (Jones) and his goober deputy Tobey (Moore) and discovers the town is essentially cut off, meaning few get in, and no one gets out (alive, that is).  As the film progresses we learn the town has, in fact, been invaded by a coven of elderly witches with some sort of agenda that involves killing parents and stealing children...for what purpose?  Well, you'll just have to watch to find that out.  Anyway, some more children are taken (including K.T.), the witches deal with one of their own who has strayed (seems the `Master' isn't very forgiving...go figure), and those not yet dead by some odd fashion struggle to comprehend just what exactly is going on...things eventually come to a head as the witches perform a black mass ceremony as Ben, Nicky, the sheriff, Tobey, and the local minister begin to unravel the sinister plot which has taken hold of the small town.

While I did enjoy this film, it does have a few serious flaws, the main one being for the first twenty minutes or so there doesn't seem to be much of a story as we spend the time witnessing a series of seemingly unrelated events (I've watched this film twice now, and it makes a hell of a lot more sense the 2nd time around).  Things do clear up at some later point in the movie, but by that time I suspect a number of viewers will have probably lost some amount of interest.  Another aspect I thought lacking was the presence of a true lead character.  I thought the character of Ben was meant to fill this position, but he never really stepped up as either Charles Bateman just wasn't leading man material, or the role wasn't written in such a way to make his character stand out (I'm leaning more towards the latter).  As a result, we're left to glom onto the various recognizable performers, namely Jones, Martin, and Moore, to fill the void, which they do somewhat, but it just felt odd given they were all supporting characters (I will say this movie's worth seeing for Strother Martin's over the top performance).  About a third of the way through the film I figured out most of what was going on (the proverbial beans are spilt) in terms of the children, so it was kind of downhill after that point as there weren't any real shocking surprises left.  I would have preferred the story to have been structured slightly differently as to have saved some of the juice for the end, but there you go (the ending is of the downbeat type as was common throughout the late 1960s into the 1970s)...there were some interesting attempts at the surreal, one of which included a children's birthday party with a Satanic twist (I've never seen a cake with black frosting before...it doesn't look all that tasty), some of which worked, some of which didn't, but all were entertaining regardless.  There are some uneasy sequences (the use of the children's toys as tools of murder, the various rituals, the robed acolytes, etc.) that defiantly added a creepy, sinister, and slightly funky tone to the film, but given the viewer has to sort of fill gaps numerous times throughout the film, any momentum derived from these parts sort of dribbles away.  There was a good amount of violence in the film, but much of it isn't shown, probably due to budgetary constraints.  I did feel there was a real effort put forth by most involved in the film, and while the end product might be lacking, I still found it entertaining and worth a look, especially if you enjoy oddball, offbeat, unconventional horror features from the 1970s (I know I do).

The picture quality on this DVD release, presented in widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic, looks surprisingly sharp and clean, and the audio, available in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono, comes through very well.  As far as extras, there's not a lot except for subtitles in English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Thai, along with a few trailers including a Creature Features promo, Hollow Man (2000), and The Craft (1996).

379,5.0,"I am a yoga newbie. I've never taken a class. Though I've had this as a digital download for a couple years-- this is my first yoga video. Please keep this in mind when you consider my review.

LONG story about my back pain ahead! Skip to ""END of long story!"" if you've no interest in why I needed this help video and only want to really hear about the DVD/digital program Pros and Cons. :-)

+++++++++++++++++
I've worked desk jobs for years, and after 2008 I have mostly worked in the video game industry. This means less than healthy hours worked for less than healthy durations, eating less than healthy catered food for too many meals of the day while sitting in less than healthy ergonomic conditions. We were usually given any ergonomic equipment requested: special chairs, foot rests, wrist rests, keyboards, lumbar cushions, etc. You name it. We were encouraged to get up and stretch regularly, but in reality this doesn't always happen when you are working on a deadline. You work, work, work and later you and your body regrets. This cycle is repeated hourly, daily, weekly... you get the idea.

Over the years I have luckily avoided carpal tunnel, but I have managed to royally mess up my back just by sitting and not exercising. I am not obese, but sitting too much is just really that freaking bad for your body!

I've had sciatica - in my 20s no less! - and it was brutal. It was a chronic issue for awhile. Then it sort of worked itself out with some stretches a friend suggested, and it only cropped up now and then until the specific sciatic nerve pain disappeared. Yet the pain in my lower back persisted, centralizing around a vertebra which could sometimes pop in and out of place. When it would pop out it would leave me hobbling or in near unbearable pain. In reaction to the pain my muscles would tense, which often seemed to be preventing the vertebra from realigning itself. Things all up my back to my neck and shoulders would be affected by the strain as my whole body would clench in pain throwing out the balance of the entire system, as it were.

When my back was out I couldn't get the Brita out of the fridge. When it wasn't out I was dealing with the aftermath of my body having seized up to ""carry on"" with life despite the painful lower back issues. It was just brutal. If I let myself think about it I would feel like I was ancient and that my body was trashed. At one point, with one job, I had health insurance for a brief period of time. Ironically it was at this time that I was so crunched that I couldn't get time off work during our launch push in order to go to the doctor. When I did get the time I happened to inexplicably not be in any extreme pain, but confessed it was at least an 8 on my pain scale when the back went out. Then I explained that I didn't want pain pills-- they make me feel dopey. I wanted to not feel crippled and I wanted my back to get better instead of relying on drugs to pretend I didn't have a vertebra popped out of place! The doctor really seemed to take me seriously at that point. I was given some muscle relaxers, which I sparingly used in the evenings when I really needed to, and a set of stretches. I was also encouraged to try yoga.

The pills helped me relax enough that I could literally pop my vertebra in place with my two thumbs. The stretches seemed to help but I felt sort of directionless with them. I got this digital download for my Kindle and when my job was lost in a company-wide layoff, when the muscle relaxers ran out - this program was still there for me and my back trauma. This program... I can't even begin to explain how good it is for me these last couple years!

Now, whenever I use this program I can go from a pain that is just under the pain-threshold I felt with appendicitis to literally nearly feeling as though I am floating on a cloud. But the first few times I was wobbly, unsure. The moves were weird, new and difficult-- I was (and admittedly am) really out of shape! But after watching it once or twice while trying to do the poses I got the general idea. The wonderful thing is that once you know the moves you can just listen, never having to crane your neck to watch as you yoga-pretzel yourself, because Mr. Yee does an amazing job of explaining every single move.

As you get more comfortable with the program, and you really listen to all the little things he says like ""feel your back release"" and ""breathe into the stretch""... and you close your eyes, really visualize and follow his guidance... this program goes from great to INTERSTELLAR! I was not exaggerating when I said I can go from staggering pain (can't push a vacuum, walk up the stairs, pick up a bottle of laundry soap without wincing at a sharp reminder pain and/or wrenching the lower back further) to complete bliss with any given use of this 50-something minute program. I have found that really visualizing all of Mr. Yee's breathing, stretching and visualization guides boost the results many times over. I also found that when I listen to my body - which will say similar and totally different things than your body will say to you - I don't ever hurt myself.

One last important thing for other newbies. Remember when I said I had never gone to a yoga class? Well, I have found that 1. I don't know how to do Downward Dog properly AND/OR 2. It just isn't any good for me. It makes my elbows hurt really badly and this strain ripples through my body negating the possible benefits of the pose. I tried to wiggle into a better pose. I tried to read how to adjust my posture, but found little difference in the discomfort level. I powered through it a number of times thinking my body would get stronger but... without a pro I have decided not to risk hurting myself and I just do child's pose and/or the cat/cow poses thing in lieu of the downward dog. I let myself really stretch into the poses thinking about broadening my muscles away from the spine, or stretching my arms out as far as I can. I breathe... and frankly it feels amazing. Then, when Mr. Yee is done with the downdog part of the flow, I carry on with the rest of the program and this works for me. You may need to make alterations of your own and all I can say is: really listen to your body and gently, carefully, do what feels right. I do, and because of this the program works for me and I get so much out of it. I couldn't be happier with the program as it is, or with my little adjustments and tweaks.

END of long story!
+++++++++++++++++

PROS:
-Soothing narration/soundtrack - Mr. Yee has a calming voice and there is a very subtle new agey track softly playing in the background

-Descriptive flow narration - Once you know the poses you never have to look at the screen unless you want (maybe to watch the pretty waves of the ocean?) because Yee will not only tell you the pose, but how to move into it, how to breathe and a large number of really helpful visualizations. He does a stellar job here.

- Effective program - This has helped me with lower, middle, upper back pain along with shoulder and neck pain of a variety of sorts. Every single time I do this video, especially if I do the whole ~50 minutes of it, I feel anywhere from ""just pretty darned relieved"" to ""ready to dance with a unicorn, fart sparkly rainbows!"" or maybe something more mundane like ""smile and just take a nap"".

CONS:
- No HD version - at least not on Amazon. I could take or leave this, honestly, as I don't ""watch"" this program anymore anyway. I listen and close my eyes and make my back feel AWESOME with it. You might care though, so I am mentioning this for you! :-)

-Pacing - There are times I just wanna sit in each pose longer and/or repeat one that is feeling REALLY good for whatever problem I am having that day. The program can be done as-is with no issues, and you will most likely feel beyond fantastic doing it that way, but if I wish for a more leisurely pace at times you may, too! When I am feeling rushed I will press my toe on the spacebar of my handy mini-wireless keyboard to pause the workout. Then I will hold the poses and/or do more of the ones I am enjoying. When I feel ready, I unpause and move on. Presto!

THINGS YOU NEED:
-Yoga block - at least 1 but 2 would be helpful
-Yoga mat - or not, if you feel comfortable in the poses without one.
-Towel - at least 1 but I find having a small one and a large one, pre-rolled and rubber-banded, to be very helpful
-Strap - you only need this briefly but it feels SO good! I bet you could substitute a belt or a strip of ribbon, cloth, etc. etc. if you were low on funds and a bit creative
-Bolster - I splurged and got a decent one (not one of the really over-priced name brand versions, but a firm, well-stitched one). I use it on its own sometimes when I am just a little uncomfy with my back or while I am reading in bed cause it is just so comfortable. I love it and it was a worthwhile purchase. You could probably substitute with a large pillow, cushion or something - again be creative if you haven't got the cash. If it works, and makes you feel great, I won't knock it!
- Chairs - 2, he uses folding chairs.

Bottom Line: I love, love, love, LOVE this program. I've used it MANY times in the last couple years and the ONLY thing that would make it better would be if I were more consistent in doing it. I admit that I often put it off until I am in pain, and that is a shame, because I feel like doing this program at least a few times a week could prevent the problems before they cropped up. My significant other has seen me in my worst pain and seen me after using this to mitigate said pain, and he agrees with me how great this program is. When I am just a little out of whack he will say, ""Why don't you do your yoga?"" and I smile and say, ""Yes, I think I will!"". I love him, too!

Best of luck to YOU and your back pain going away! I hope this review helps and that no matter what happens you find a good way to end your suffering. :-)"
380,4.0,"The chick on the cover isn't in the movie at all lets just get that out of the way. This movie is just plain fun, lots of boobs, counselors and campers with serious mullets and really bad effects makeup. the continuity is lacking and so is the writing for that matter BUT I LOVE THIS MOVIE> because I love the ""campy"" aspect no pun intended. Angela is back on this movie but this time she isn't the wallflower quiet camper that secretly kills her fellow campers and the staff, no this time around she is UBER-COUNSELOR!!! She sings Kum-bay-yah and tries to keep her cabin full of girls(who are to freaking old to be campers) from losing thier shirts, literally, at all moments of the day. She clashes with other staff members because she sticks to the rules, and she Kills when she sees them being broke, She is the ""angel of death"" only slaughtering those who deserve to be killed. Angela practically skips through each murder with a giant grin and a biting humorous line or two. You want these brats to get offed, especially Allie the wet t-shirt, nappy-headed slut. This film outdoes the first one by a mile, so go rent a cabin, eat s'mores, grab your deep woods off and have a good time with this one!"
381,5.0,"Really, I am tired of you little nerds that have nothing better to do that sit and critize every freaking aspect of the movie.  If that's your deal, fine, but everyone once in a while it wouldnt hurt you to just sit down and WATCH a movie... instead of judging it.
I thought this movie was as funny as can be.. yet the very first time I saw it, it was me (female) and 4 other guys.  I was the only one laughing during the movie.  The guys had a couple of stiff laughs here and there, but not as much as me.
It's so stupid, it's silly.. it made me laugh until my stomach hurt.  Just seeing these guys pretending to be like girls, and seeing what women mostly go through on a typical day.. just made it better.
I suggest watching this movie to anyone that feels like have a few good laughs.. it's worth it!!"
382,2.0,"The thing about this movie is this:

- as a Friday movie, it sucks big gorilla fingers. There's too much wrong with it to be consistent.

- step aside from all you know about any other Friday movie, and it sort of works.

I'm a huge Jason fan, but the last 2 films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-X/dp/B00006FI0R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason X</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jason-Goes-to-Hell/dp/B00006FDBT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jason Goes to Hell</a>), seem more like side projects and not actual Friday the 13th films. Jason X disregards many aspects the diehard fans cannot possibly look over.
For example:
- Why does Jason have so much hair? It's so frizzy, almost like an afro.
- When is it supposed to have taken place, after coming back from hell, from the sewers of NY? It seems to be some time around now (2010?) but it isn't clear.
- Why is Jason's mask so new, so intact (especially after getting split and destroyed in previous films), yet still have the split in the forehead from part 3?
- Why is Jason so clean, so un-rotted? In part 7 & 8, he skin was brown, almost black (even in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freddy-vs-Jason/dp/B0000VCZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freddy vs. Jason</a>&nbsp;his skin is black). Here, you clearly see pinkish, flesh colored skin, especially around the face and hands. They explain it that he can regenerate new tissue, but that's just weak. He wouldn't/couldn't have rotted so much in part 7 if he could regenerate new tissue.
- Why is everyone on the ship so freaking hot? Why is the professor the only adult on there, surrounded by a bunch of ""college"" kids?

These questions aren't answered, and don't really expect them to be. This is why so many people hate this movie. And I, as a hardcore Jason fan, agree with them.

But as a spin-off of the Friday the 13th series (alah, the many paperback novels spun from this series), it definitely works. Forget all you know about Jason and Crystal Lake and let this story fill you in on whatever fits to the plot.

That being said I have to make one more statement: any series that takes the plot in space (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leprechaun-4-In-Space/dp/B000055WFU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leprechaun 4 - In Space</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellraiser-Bloodline/dp/B00004Y633/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellraiser - Bloodline</a>) is definitely hurting for ideas and it's time to kill the franchise. Until we can really see ourselves in space, please don't take our favorite characters we've grown to love and commit the ultimate abortion by sending them in space. No matter how plausible you try to make it seem, it's just pathetic and ridiculous."

Just like the original story, Pat and Mac start freaking out a bit when McDuff (Christopher Walken) doesn't accept the scapegoat they set up and starts investigating Duncan's murder further.

386,3.0,"Basically Robotech is the adaptation of three completely unrelated Japanese animes into a continuous saga. As such, great and frequently clumsy lengths are made to link the three stories.

Giant robots alone carry a lot of weight with me and Macross (the Japanese series that the first Robotech series lifts from) broke some major ground both in the US and Japan and the first series is certainly the strongest but it wasn't as phenomenal as I remembered it.

Southern Cross (adapted to chapter 2) and Mospeda (adapted to chapter 3) aren't held in particularly high regard by anime fans and as such are pretty weak as rehashed addons to a story that had a perfectly satisfying end.

Southern Cross in particular is pretty weak and even as a kid I considered it to be sloppy seconds compared to the other series. Even the giant robot designs are rather dull and uninspired and the action leaves much to be desired. I couldn't care less about the characters and the plot is forgettable.

Loved the design of Mospeda but the story occasionally had me bored to tears even though it had me totally enthralled as a teenager. In fact I think it may have been my favorite at the time.

Basically it comes down to this. If you can reread something like Dragonlance's Chronicles as an adult and not want to throw it against a wall, you're going to freaking love watching Robotech again especially given the sheer viewing hours you get for the price.

But as an adult gamer, anime watcher, and continued speculative fiction devotee, my tastes have grown and I'm pretty much over it. Now if somebody could finally manage to make a truly awesome Robotech GAME, that would be exciting."
387,3.0,"Not as  good  as Shark attack I and 2 were but still okay.  In  mexico  two megladon have start acting people.  Chese parts I think this was  supposed to be a rip of off Jaws 3.  Like in Jaws three there is a bady and adult shark.  But the adult megladon is freaking huge.
The baby is  about  15 feet long.  The adult mother is huge 80 feet long.  That  about 2.5 times as long  as the adult Shark in Jaws three.  Good  film like the other to  shark attacks.  Ending is not a dramtic as it was in the second one.
I you like this film I recomend  Shark attack 1 and 2.  The best  movie  I  could recomend Is Deep Blue Sea.  There is Shark hunter also but it has a crappy  ending."
388,1.0,"I saw this with my now dearly departed father in 2002.

I found it suspenseful and intense in certain parts I also did not mind the Michael in this movie.

However the beginning of the movie ruined the entire film as did the stupid concept with the webcams and crap.

When I originally watched it I found the concept...interesting somewhat unique at least.

I also remember almost falling asleep more then a few times because this movie was pretty damn boring.

The characters were all dispensable and almost everyone of them was either cocky or just flat out annoying.

The lead actress taking over for Laurie Strode will get too that in a minute was okay in her role I liked her originally up until the end of the film when she saved a character I truly wanted too die with a passion.

Then I wanted HER too die immediately.

Busta Rhymes what can one say? He cant sing for s!%^ he also cant act for s@!^ he was basically himself just more cockier if even possible with that douche.

He was one of the most obnoxious and unlikeable characters in this film by far.

Thomas Ian Nicolas was a stereotype a horny boyfriend who wanted some from his annoying girlfriend we all know what happens too guys like that in a horror movie.

Katee Sackhoff who I think is normally a wonderful actress as well as likeable in real life was totally obnoxious in this film and it really sucked that they wrote her character the way they did.

She was not only obnoxious but also ditzy stupid and braindead too boot.

The rest are actors I cant even remember their names except Tyra Banks who didn't have much ACTING ability in this film and didn't last long either.

She was also a stereotype horny black woman with sass thrown in for good measure.

The writing in this movie was absolutely horrible.

Then there are the teens watching at home and the guy helping the main girl try too survive they were also cocky and unlikeable.

I was rooting for them as well as the equally boring and dispensable teens who join the slaughter party near the middle of the movie too also die.

Literally there is hardly anyone whatsoever in this movie that you actually want too survive including the good looking moody so called macho guy with the leather jacket.

Or the trampy red head who just wants too get laid yet actually acts as if she has scruples lol

Or the black guy who loves too cook and also acts cocky from beginning too end...what a moron this one was especially.

Oh did I mention Laurie? Silly me well no worries there pay no attention to that mention considering shes only in the movie for about 5 freaking minutes if that.

Yes SPOILER ALERT!!!! They kill Laurie off in one of the absolute stupidest ways possible and they also insult the intelligence of the viewer by actually making us think the once clever smart and creative Laurie could actually be this clueless stupid and wreckless.

After killing Laurie Strode this entire movie was a total waste of my time from then on there.

Extremely stupid move no wonder so many Halloween fans think this and the Halloween remake sequel are 2 of the worst entries into the franchise I agree completely.

Oh and did I forgot too mention theres some very dumb scene where the main actress lets out this unbelievably grating scream ...due too a light falling behind her and shattering?

Yeah this one was a real winner  sarcasm detected sarcasm detected."

I was freaking rolling on the floor laughing at this. It's the most fun I've had with my DVD player in years. I've seen it about 10 times now and it just gets better and better.

This is exactly what you would expect from a ""Bride of Anything"" movie. Silly cosutumes, a ridiculous plot and the diologue of the doomed.

393,4.0,"This anime is kind of hard to judge.  The first episode blew me away with all the action sequences and the absolutely fantastic music but then as it progressed, the episodes just began to d...r...a....g.... and go so freaking slowly.  Its not that they weren't interesting but they were dragged out so unbearably long that I found myself zoning out many times.  So, this is the only way I can think to judge it.
Music-  Fabulous! I absolutely adore it! Its beautiful and eerie and really kicks up the fight scenes.  Probably half the reason I like the show.
Background designs-  Its beautiful! Totally beautiful and detailed backgrounds.  The cobblestone buildings and roads, the sky, everything is totally gorgeous.
Action scenes-  When they're there, the fighting is great.  Its edge of your seat stuff and very impressive.
Character designs-  eh, a bit plain in my opinion.  Pretty much like a lot of other animes I've seen.  But the characters are colored nicely.
Plot-  Okay, I think I'm missing something here.  The younger girl, whatever her name is with the short dark hair,  wants to find out her past.  Right.  So she goes to the Blond girl Mirelle.  Now, they have to go on random assassination attempts for what reason?  I don't get it! How the heck is assassinating these people, when I don't even know who they are or how the heck they're related to anything, going to bring back that girl's past?  What are they doing!!  Yes, I like the action sequences but half the time, I dont' have any idea who they're fighting and what it has to do with anything! Argh!
English dub-  everyone's voices are pretty decent.  I usually find myself watching the dub if its good, and the sub if it isn't good.  However, the younger dark haired character's english voice is awful!  She sounds like she's making her voice as high pitched and choked up sounding as possible.  Ugh, she sounds like she's going to cry all the time.  The sub is much nicer.  Her voice is soft without being whiny and very pretty.
Character developement- The first episode intrigued me with the two main characters.  I wanted to know more about them.  But after the episodes progressed and I was left with slow moving story,  flashbacks that are repeated over and over and over again, I just didn't care anymore.  They just show too little human emotion and I can't seem to get attatched to them. How can you care about characters that don't care about... pretty much anything?  So truthfully, they could both drop dead and I wouldn't exactly be traumatized.  Might make it a little more interesting to tell you the truth.
Overall, I'd have to say if I continue this show it'll be for the art, the music, and the few fight scenes that are great when they're actually there.  However, if it continues to drag like this, I'll probably just give up."
394,5.0,"I watched adault swim, after seeing funny showes like Home Movies, and the brak show, I saw a show called cowboy bebop.  I was like, ""Ohh what's this?""  The first episode I saw was ""Ballad of fallen angels""  It had me hooked, and I was interested, and the shootout rasid my excitement pretty high, and I was introduced to one of my favorite anime's ever.
The characters are definitly one of the greatest casts ever.
Spike:He's definitly one of the best hero's ever.  All he needs is a pistol, and his fighting technuiqes to bust bounty hunters up, altho most of their plans backfire.  He travels with Ject, Faye, Ed, and Ein, he can't stand the fact that trouble, hackers, and aimals are on the ship, and he always thinks, how the hell did all three of them get on a once peaceful ship?  He also has a pretty nice ship that he flys all the time when he needs to catch up with someone who has a bounty on his head.  And he has a violent past of being with the syndacate(te red dragon, a yakuza mafia) he hated the syndacate so much, he faked his death just to get out of it.  But he's nowhere near away from the syndacate, cause has a lot of run ins with them along his way, and eventually leads him to a final showdown with the syndacate.
Ject:Former police officer who joins spike shortly after Spike leaves the syndacate.  Ject is the pilot of the bebop, and man he has to fix, clean, and cook,(Jeez it must really stink that he has to cook too).  He also meets his past throughout the series(and you get to find out what happens to his arm.
Faye:You get to say hello to Faye in ""Honky Tonk Women"".  She is the laziest member of the crew(But she's pretty gosh darn sexy), and always want's money, and what does she do with it, throw it all away in a casino.  She definitly makes Spike and Ject very angry at times.  She has some moves that'll knock a enemy out of his shoes, and has a pretty nice ship as well.  But throughout all this she faces her past, as well, and we find what is up.
Ed:Ed hit's the sceene in ""Jamming with Edward""  She is very childish, and may seem a thorn in the teams side, but yet, when they need some hacking to be done, she's their best friend because, then she becomes a freaking genius.  Ed has one episode where she takes the floor and finally gets a taste of action, in ""mushroom somba"".  And later on like everyone else she, as well as faye, faces her past.
Ein:Ein was a stray dog worth BIG BUCKS, and he crashed the show in ""Stray Dog Strut"" I dunno what he does, but the dog is pretty smart.
Julia:The woman who once loved spike, and somewhat loves vicious.  Every time Spike hears her name, he just goes straight crazy, and starts looking for her.  She's somewhat mysterious in many ways, but when Spike finds her, and they plan to run away from the syndacat's wrath, but will they make it?
Vicious:One of my favorite villian's of all time(Alongside Sessomeru(Inuyasha),Knives(Trigun), and Sephroth(Final Fantasy VII).  Vicous has alot in common with these three, he has a cold, and dark heart, he evil, cruel, ruthless, and his name describes him well enough.  He is a member of the syndacate, and is undeniebly Spike's worst enemy.  They were once on the same side, but now there just two men on opposite sides, and Vicious want's Spike dead.  I really don't know what his motive is, most likeley the love over Julia, or his loyalty for the syndacate. who knows? But one day it will all be over.
I also love many episodes as well, especially these
Astroid blues:It got off to a real hot start.  Bloody eye, whatever it's called looks pretty cool, and it's Spike and Jects first bounty, a Bloody eye addict
Balled of fallen angels:The first episode I saw.  What seems like another bounty, leeds Spike into a deadly match with his past.
Sympathy for the devil:A normal kid, is very mysterious, and, for some reason, Spike's gonna need more than bullets to stop him
Toys in the attic:A pretty freaky episode.  A wierd thing affects the whole crew, and then Spike rembers something about the attic of the ship
Jupiter Jazz:Spike says hello to vicious once again, and says hello to a man, who has a very wirerd secret.
Mushroom Somba:Ed gets her time to shine.  She meets a mushroom dealer, who has trouble with a another man who lost his brother cause of his mushrooms.
Pierrot Le Fou:Gotta love the animation here.  Spike gets info on a man with a nice bounty that smiles at his enemys and that's the last thing they see.
The real folk blues:The final chapter of the whole series.  Spike meets his love Julia, but yet the sydacate is not far behind.
As to this day I'm watchin the show on adult swim, as well as Trigun, and Inuyasha.  I love this show, ad if you love anime, you shouldn't miss this.  And man this is a long review, and for those who read it, thank you, and I hope it was helpful.
Last words:This series will not only make you remember the wild rollercoaster it took you on, but also how bitterly sweet and sad it ended
peace"

396,4.0,"Not for non-Star Wars fans, even those who like Family Guy.  Basically if you haven't seen and appreciated The Empire Strikes Back, you will have little love for this film.  A female friend of mine who loves Family Guy, but who never has seen Star Wars (right?!?!?!?!?!) hated it.

I appreciate the witty humor and the crossover of the Family Guy characters into their Star Wars roles.

If you like this you should also check out Shin Chan, a Japanese anime spoof of star wars.  Pretty freaking awesome too!"
397,5.0,"Let me start out by saying that I think that this is the best documentary ever made. After I left the theater I remember my girlfriend saying that ""everyone should have to watch that movie"" and I agree for the most part. Although, I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone that took part in the Dixie Chicks CD bashing last spring.
This movie takes you on a journey to find out why America is so freaking trigger happy and at no point do they come right out and say it, but you'll know by the end of the film. Moore, like a true patriot, criticizes America, it's government, it's foreign policy, and the media.
At some points it seemed as though Moore was jumping all over the place, talking about American history, the weapons industry, gun laws, the media's treatment of blacks, columbine, and militias. It is apparent though that all of these topics are important in understanding the complexity of America's obsession with violence.
This film has sad moments, hilarious moments, and tense moments, but it seems to be mostly a comedy until the end when Moore confronts Mr. Heston of the NRA. I was shocked at how hard Michael Moore was on Charlton Heston and it kinda gave me a bad feeling. It was a tense awkward scene that almost makes Michael seem like the bad guy. However, at the end, when he leave a picture of a little girl killed in school by a gun it reminds you that Mr. Heston's NRA was only concerned with gun rights when this girl was killed, so they held a rally near her home. I respect Mr. Moore for leaving this scene in tact instead of cutting it down to make himself look better. In real life things don't often happen how we want them to and this final scene captures an awkward real life situation."

399,4.0,"Identity is a rare type of horror movie. All of the characters relatively avoid stupid actions that would otherwise have them killed off. Also, the film manages to pull off a feeling of suspense fairly well. Our story begins with 10 strangers being holed up in a ratty motel together during a harsh thunderstorm. Among the people there, a limo driver, a washed up actress, a cop escorting a convict convicted of murder, a prostitute, two newlyweds, and a troubled family. The motel is run by a suspicious guy named Larry who is getting a little too involved in everyones businness. All are guests are doing well, save the wife of a troubled stepfather who was hit by a car during the storm. Every ones enjoying their stay, until the movie star shows up in a dryer decapitated. After that incident, some of the guests begin freaking out, particularly the newlyweds who get into a savage fight. Also, the convict has broken loose from his shackles and is wondering around the motel, his location unknown. Now the fun begins, the husband to Ginny is found stabbed, the convict has had a baseball bat shoved down his throat, and all the while noone knows who is going to die next. That's part of the fun though, trying to unravel the mystery, and discover the killer. However, my major gripe with this movie is that the character of Ginny is extremely annoying, and to tell you the truth, I couldn't be happier when I witnessed her death. The ending was actually pretty good. When you first find out the twist, you'll probably think it's pretty weak, but believe me, it gets way better.

Rated R: strong violence, gore, language

Body Count: 11

Best Death: Baseball bat shoved down throat, or decapitation"
400,5.0,"Here is a obscure one for ya a movie that came and went in 83
THE RETURN OF CAPTAIN INVINCIBLE... It is set in 1942 and Captain
Invincible is a overweight alcoholic who is forgotten till Christopher
(DRACULA)Lee wants to take over the world(don't the bad guys ever want
to do something else???) This is no MASTERPIECE by any means but if
you have Pot Pie in the oven or laundry washing give this a looksie!
Best moments are when a U.S.A. plane is getting shot by the NAZI'S
and Captain Invincible is sitting on the nose of the plane drinking
a beer and having a smoke while the plane is going down and the
pilots are freaking out(not to worry Cap. saves them) and my favorite
is Christopher(DRACULA)Lee doing a song? That was written and aranged
by Richard(ROCKY HORROR)O'Brian the music in this is like HORROR
and not Shock Treatment...Better than CONDOR MAN...
Have to confess saw this and thought of my Bro's MR.K.I.A Stan RUNKDAPUNK

402,1.0,"I am a former horror movie junkie. I've been addicted to horror movies for a good 10 years of my life. Recently, I stopped caring about horror movies. Why? Because horror movies nowadays suck. I remember watching GOOD horror movies such as the original House On Haunted Hill, Wolf Man, or Nosferatu. Sure, these movies weren't scary (how many horror movies actually are), but they had class.

Nowadays, people consider movies like Resident Evil scary. What? Who in their right mind considers that scary? Does RE have a good story? No. Does RE have good characters? No. Is Milla Jovovich hot? No. Does RE deserve a sequel? No. Did it get one? Sadly, yes.

Movies just aren't what they used to be. Sure, there are a few surprises every now and then, like the House On Haunted Hill remake, or The Ring, but that just isn't enough.

And, of course, Darkness Falls isn't exactly gold either.

Right from the start, you can already tell that this movie screwed itself. To begin, the movie clearly says that the ""tooth fairy"" will kill anybody that has seen her face. This wonderful fact that the movie provided us with was immediately screwed up when Kyle's mother, who hadn't see the fairy at all, was killed. Then there's also the fact that everyone she had killed later on never really seen her face at all. They only saw her mask.

You can also tell from the moment they showed Caitlin with her brother that the story was going to be corny. As a matter of fact, before I even seen the movie, I bet myself that I could guess what would happen.

I guessed that what will happen is that Kyle, the main character, will be so racked with guilt about his ""ex-girlfriend"" and her brother (who amazingly knew ALL about Kyle's experience as a child without no one ever telling him and who also immediately liked him for no reason at all) that he will come back to protect them even though he is terrified of the tooth fairy. Somewhere along the way, Michael will be trapped by tooth fairy and Caitlin or, the more likely, Kyle will jump out of nowhere and rescue him, then as they run away, the tooth fairy will just stay there to look at them for a moment before chasing after them. All throughout the movie, the tooth fairy will have an incredibly hard time catching them even though, logically, she should have done it easily. Finally, at the end, Kyle will find a way to trap and kill her, then he and Caitlin kisses and they all live happily ever after. Hey, maybe Larry will be killed or Michael will even do some brave act just to add to the corniness.

That was my prediction for Darkness Falls. Can you guess how close I was? If you said 95%, then you are correct!

When I finished the movie, there were plot holes galore! And that was just from the first viewing! I haven't seen so many plot holes since Home Alone 4! But before I talk about the plot holes, let see how correct my predictions were.

About Kyle being racked with guilt, that part is debatable. It doesn't show that he feels guilty for long, but why else would he come back after saying no? And it seems I was right about the second part. Michael and (as an added bonus) Caitlin was trapped, not once, but TWICE! And Kyle saved them both times. Isn't that terrific? And as for the tooth fairy standing still to watch them run away, it didn't happen immediately, but it did eventually happen just when she had Kyle trapped. All throughout the movie, it was shown that the tooth fairy moves very fast, yet she slows down immensely just when the opportunity to catch Kyle and the others pop up. The only part I was wrong about was Kyle and Caitlin kissing, but they did live happily ever after.

Oh, and guess what? Larry was killed.

Now on to the plot holes. All throughout the movie, it was also shown that the tooth fairy couldn't stand a bit of light, no matter how thin or weak the light is. So if this is the case, then how was she able to attack those hospital staff members during their run through the hallway? And why was she able to attack the cop and Kyle near the end even those they had light with them? And why is she able to stand the lightning? It illuminates everything almost as well as the freaking lighthouse!

This movie just plain sucks."
403,4.0,"This is still a sophomoric show with more than its share of low humor but it still has a strange appeal. The cast of characters consists primarily of a bunch of kids. They go through life getting themselves into sticky situations and generally come out of them better than the adults around them. Though animated, it is not a show for kids. The humor is adult in nature, often gross and always irreverent.

Episode synopses follow:

Terrence and Phillip in Not Without My Anus - Last season left off with a cliffhanger episode in which we had to wait for this season to find out the identity of Cartman's dad. Instead of resolving the cliffhanger, though, they produced a special ""April Fool's"" episode featuring Terrence and Phillip. It's fairly lame.

Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut - The cliffhanger is resolved...after the mad scientist is shot, put on life support, taken to the hospital etc. Cartman is freaking out trying to figure out who his father is...He does not take well to stress.

Chickenlover - The kids get sent out to a bookmobile only to learn that the driver has a fetish for chickens. This is a crime that has little chance of being solved since the only policeman is illiterate.

Ike's Wee-Wee - Stan's brother is going to be circumcised and the kids are invited to the celebration. They don't really understand that it's the first big ripoff in life.

Conjoined Fetus Lady - Kyle hurts his nose playing dodgeball in school and is sent to the nurse. She has a conjoined twin fetus attached to her head. The town decides to raise awareness about this condition while the kids go to the dodgeball world championship in China.

The Mexican Staring Frog of Souther Sri Lanka - The kids are assigned to interview of somebody who was in Vietnam. They interview a psycho uncle and his sidekick who host a hunting show. The show runs opposite a talk show run by Jesus.

Flashback - The kids' schoolbus gets caught on a cliff and the harridan/driver goes for help. The kids do a flashback episode while the driver develops a career as a comedian and falls in love.

Summer Sucks - School lets out and the kids are looking forward to buying fireworks only to find that fireworks have now been banned.

Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls - The Sundance Film Festival gets moved to Southpark. The resulting influx of Hollywood types threatens to destroy the ecosystem of the local sewers.

Chickenpox - Kenny has the chickenpox. When the moms learn that chickenpox is more dangerous for older people, they decide to send the kids to spend the night so they will get the disease young. The kids want vengeance.

Roger Ebert Should Eat Less Fatty Foods - The kids visit a planetarium run by a strange man. It seems that his equipment is some sort of strange mind control device.

Clubhouse - Stan and Kyle build a clubhouse so they will have a place to play truth or dare with the girls. Cartman and Kenny decide to build their own competing club.

Cow Days - The kids investigate the midway at the local Cow Days. They blow their money trying to win Terrence and Phillip dolls. Meanwhile, the local cows form their own cult.

Chef Aid - Chef finds out that a song he wrote 20 years ago has become a hit. When he raises the issue, the record company sues him. He winds up owing 2 million in legal fees and the kids try to raise money to help.

Spookyfish - It's a Halloween special and everything is weird.  Stanley's mother is having a monthly bout of PMS and strange things are happening. These include Cartman being nice and a haunted goldfish. Death and mayhem are the order of the day.

Merry Christmas Charlie Manson - The kids go to visit Cartman's grandparents and learn that Eric's traits are genetic. While there, his uncle breaks out of prison and brings his friend, Charles Manson with him.

Gnomes - The kids get assigned to write a report on current events in Southpark. One of the parents is fighting a corporate takeover of his business and writes the report for them. It's a difficult choice over whether to submit the prewritten report or work on one about little gnomes stealing underwear late at night.

Prehistoric Ice Man - While hunting for crocodiles in the mountains of Colorado, the kids find a body frozen in the ice. Theories abound as to whether the body is prehistoric or not even though it is dated to 1996."
404,4.0,"I want to complain that Trey Parker & Matt Stone go too far on ""South Park: The Complete Second Season,"" only (a) their obvious aim in life is to ""go too far"" and (b) they cross the threshold for me on their introductions to the episodes on Disc 2 and not in any of the actual episodes (although clearly there are many who will disagree on both of those points).  It has long ago been established that Matt & Trey are not as funny as themselves as any given episode of ""South Park.""  In their introductions on the first disc they are back haranguing the people in that retirement home, but on the second disc we are treated to a faux infomercial for ""Making Bacon with Macon,"" where they keep feeding bacon to a pig.  I do not know why pig cannibalism bothers me when I thought nothing of Parker's musical ""Cannibal!"" but then consistency is the hobgoblin of something or other.  Therefore, by way of protesting persistent feeding of bacon to a big, I have rounded down and not up in rating this DVD set (take THAT, Matt & Trey).

Considering these eighteen episodes without the introductory bits, which disappear on the third disc to be replaced by a documentary on ""The Making of South Park,"" there are at least a half-dozen classic episode:

(14) ""Terrance & Phillip in 'Not Without My Anus'"" is infamous because instead of finding out who is Cartman's father, as an April Fool's Joke we get a complete Terrance & Phillip episode.  The  best part of this one is the attempt to stop Saddam Hussein from taking over Canada. (3.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(15) ""Cartman's Mom is Still a Dirty Slut"" prolongs answering the question about who is Cartman's dad by a pair of running gags,  the narrator reviewing possible suspects for absolutely every question posed in the and Liane Cartman's confusion over the differences between ""abortion"" and ""adoption.""  While Eric might disagree the answer to the big question in this one is pretty sweet: who saw it coming? (5 Cheezy Poofs)

(16) ""Ike's Wee Wee"" has two main plotlines, the better of which is Kyle and the boys freaking out when they discover what is going to happen to Ike's ""fireman"" during a Bris.  Then there is Mr. Mackey being fired (m'kay) when the sample of mary-j-uana he passed around the boy's class as part of a drug & alcohol prevention lecture (they're bad) disappears.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(17) ""Chickenlover"" proves that reading is more FUN-damental than we thought.  Obviously the big parody here is of ""COPS"" as Cartman demands everyone respect his ""authoritah.""  (4.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(18) ""Conjoined Fetus Lady"" is another one where the two plotlines go their separate ways.  The satire of people helping those who do not want help is good enough, but the whole dodgeball competition bit is even better as the boys finally learn why it is okay to hate foreigners when it is not okay to hate Americans of different races or ethnicity. (5.0 Cheezy Poofs)

(19) ""The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka"" somehow gets from Uncle Jimbo telling the boys about the good life in Vietnam during the war to Jesus cursing.  Telling the truth is apparently an important thing.  (4.0 Cheezy Poofs)

(20) ""City on the Edge of Forever"" (a.k.a. ""Flashbacks"") is a brilliant twist on a television clip show.  Trapped in their school bus on the edge of a cliff, the boys recall previous ""sticky situations,"" only all of the familiar scenes now include ice cream.  Meanwhile, Ms. Crabtree becomes the hottest comedienne around and the parents record a song to have their ""runaway"" children come home.  (5.0 Cheezy Poofs)

(21) ""Summer Sucks"" is a kitchen sink episode that combines Mr. Hat's disappearance with Cartman taking swimming lessons and the biggest fireworks snake in the world.  A guest appearance by Dr. Katz stands out in this one.  (3.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(22) ""Chef's Salty Chocolate Balls"" has South Park becoming the site of an Independent Film Festival and we learn that Chef's culinary creation does wonders for Mr. Hankey.  The music video in the special features is better than the episode, although you have to appreciate the idea of Mr. Hankey as a metaphor for modern American cinema.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(23) ""Chickenpox"" has the parents conspiring to have their boys get the disease while they are young.  Kyle learns of the conspiracy and the boys come up with a way of teaching their parents a lesson.  Amazing what they will laugh at on this show, dude.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(24) ""Roger Ebert Should Lay Off the Fatty Foods"" is the one where the kids go to the plane-arium and come under the mind control of Dr. Adams.  If you need Matt and Trey's introduction to recognize this episode is based on the ""Dagger of the Mind"" episode of the original ""Star Trek"" series, you need to bone up on popular culture.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(25) ""Clubhouses"" is all about divorce and playing ""Truth or Dare,"" which are more closely related than you would think.  This one has one of my favorite moments in the series, when Stan's mom agrees that, yes, the divorce is indeed Stan's fault (""Dude, you're not supposed to tell me that!"" he complains).  (4.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(26) ""Cow Days"" introduces us to not only South Park's big summer festival, during the brief period of summer, but the great principle of calling ""Shennanigans.""  Anything involving the cows of South Park is usually good, even this tragic tale, especially if Cartman thinks he is a Vietnamese prostitute named Ming Li.  (5 Cheezy Poofs)

(27) ""Chef Aid"" has the boys coming to the aid of Chef when he is sued by a record company for noticing that Alanis Morresette had recorded one of his songs without giving him credit.  Truth is on Chef's side, but Johnny Cochran and the famous ""Wookie Defense"" are on the other.  Fortunately a lot of big stars from Elton John to Meatloaf to Ozzy Osbourne lend their support and their voices to this episode.  (5 Cheezy Poofs)

(28) ""Spooky Fish"" is the gift that Stan gets from Aunt Flo, his mother's monthly visitor.  The fish tends to kill people, but that is not the strange part of this one.  That would be the ""evil"" Cartman with his goatee, another ""Star Trek"" reference (""Mirror, Mirror"").  Unfortunately this one is done in ""Spooky Vision,"" which means you have to put up with pictures of Barbra Streisand in each corner of the screen for the entire episode. (4.5 Cheezy Poofs)

(29) ""Merry Christmas Charlie Manson!"" is actually funnier than the first season ""South Park"" Christmas episode.  How can it now be since it combines Charles Manson with the key elements of ""A Charlie Brown Christmas""?  This one is sick enough to be really funny.  (5 Cheezy Poofs)

(30) ""Gnomes"" is about the attempt of Tweek Bros., the gourmet coffee house in South Park, to fend off the competition of the corporate giant, Harbucks Coffee.  Fortunately the boys are able to get the help of these gnomes who have been stealing underwear, although it is not exactly the type of help you would expect.  (4 Cheezy Poofs)

(31) ""Prehistoric Ice Man"" has the boys discovering a cave man frozen in a block of ice.  Dr. Mephisto thaws out the cave man and discovers he has been frozen for (gasp!) 32 months.  Can a primitive human being from 1996 understand the world of today?  Good question.  Meanwhile, Stan and Kyle fight over whether the cave man should be called Gorak or Steve, but work together in the end to send the cave man to a place where he can be happy.  (4.5 Cheezy Poofs)

The key defining element of the best episodes is that they are usually strong in terms of parody and/or satire.  Fortunately their use of ""Star Trek"" episodes is moving in the right direction, but when are they going to get to the really good stuff?"
405,5.0,Ted Danson is freaking amazing! The chemistry is great and the jokes are hilarious. I can stop watching. I definitely recommend this show.
406,5.0,Holy cow is this ever a great movie. One of the best of the decade in all honesty. It's just an incredibly enthralling adventure. It's long yes but it's so freaking lean. Not one second of it is anything less than mesmerizing. I would kill for this to have been a success and become a franchise.
407,5.0,So funny! So freaking funny! I love this movie! It made me laugh so hard! I've watched it so many times and I still love it!
408,2.0,"I got a great deal, or so I thought so at the time, on all of Lost In Space. I paid $60 for the collection at a local pawn shop. In reviewing the show I have to admit that about all I could remember was perhaps the song, the robot and the annoying Dr. Smith.

I have watched four discs of Season one thus far and I have to tell you it is painful drudgery. I have figured out the set. The show must have been shot for the most part in some large warehouse that they filled with lots of sand. This desert landscape is highlighted with fake rocks, mostly leaveless dead trees and for the illusion of a landscape
we have distant murals or paintings to give the illusion of a skyline.

I like the land rover vehicle even though it is entirely impractical. I also doubt it could be watertight, as it was shown in one episode. The technology was pretty good for the time I guess. The show gave birth to the idea of molecular deconstruction and reconstruction which was utilized as the transporter on Star Trek. I also like Robbie The Robot. I've always liked the acting of the young girl who went on to be in Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the second movie version. As a whole though this show is like some super wholesome 50's family that is Lost In Space. It's like Leave It To Beaver in Space. The family unit values trump the science fiction value of the show. Then there is the single guy and the single gal. What frustration to be a young man Lost In Space with a hot blonde at hand that the writers probably never let get near you.

The worst thing about this show though is Dr. Smith. Every single episode seems to be centered around his back stabbing evil ways. The man is dishonest, greedy, corrupt, a coward, a schemer, he is disloyal, he is a thief. The man is every wicked thing you can think of. Still Dr. Smith doesn't get what is coming to him. He gets booted out of the ship at times but he doesn't get the crap beat out of him. He doesn't get shot or locked up. The man is just an awful waste of space and he is the melodramatic foil to the Robinsons who are honest, virtuous, hard working, intelligent, wholesome, etc. Dr. Smith is so freaking rude to where I wonder how he doesn't get knocked on his butt in mid sentence.

I think the value of this show is how it sets us up for something great like Star Trek. Sure, the show is often entertaining and I sometimes wonder what might happen. The show is just too wholesome and the writing is weak. I want to see something besides SAND. I hate to think that the show never movies beyond that sandlot of season one. I know I'm tired already after four discs of seeing every episode set in a desert. I also hate the lovey dovey Robinson parents. Their ""love"" for each other is often just nauseating. It is very unrealistic.

I'll keep watching though, for a while at least. I want to get something out of the $60 I paid out for this collection. Right now I am watching and trying to find out what is worthwhile trying not to let the shows shortcomings ruin it all for me."
409,5.0,The movie is definitely not for everyone especially not for children. I am giving it five stars for the acting it was really good it made me feel for the characters pain. The subject matter is what was conflicting and disturbing though a reality because its something that does happen to people it make it more real and the acting on Monica's part just made me want to kill the freaking guy I won't say more to not ruin the movie for anyone interested just don't let the kids watch it will traumatize them for life
410,1.0,"This is a poorly made, vauge, and uninformative ""documentary"". It's a scattered gathering of bits and pieces from random people who seem like they have no idea what's going on. It also reveals a closely guarded secret about Anton Lavey....

He's a total freaking George McFly, just listen to his voice. He's an uninspired DWEEB in the lowest form (but what can we expect from a high school drop out and carnie whose writtings are basically watered down basterdizations of Crowley and Nietzsche).

Anywho that's my opinion on the pseudo philosphy. If you absolutely MUST see this you can see it for free and of the same quaility on Youtube."
411,1.0,"watch the trailer all it does it show part of 1 freaking scene that may be in the movie...when I was a kid I loved Robocop, it was probably my favorite movie, I watched them a lot....but I never heard of this one, or the part 1 or 2 to this one, and by the part of 1 freaking scene in the trailer it looks like I will hate this movie, I don't even understand what it's about, the summary sucks as well. why in the world would I waste $8 buying this garbage made movie??
then if I want to see the entire thing meaning I need to buy the other parts to for $8 total of $24 eh eh!!! I don't think so...you rip off enough people..."
412,5.0,"I know im nostalgic, but I love these freaking movies. Troll 1 is actually pretty dang good - troll 2 is AMAZING in all the right ways.  Where else can you see a little boy protagonist standing ontop of the dinner table mid-course and peeing on everyone's food to save the day? Troll 2 that's where.

Watch them both as soon as possible!!!!"
413,5.0,"I already own Poltergeist and I needed part 2 and 3 to complete my collection. When Poltergeist was first made there was no paranormal movies I think this was the first anyway to me at the time it was a good freaking movie .Great special effects. I really like the 2nd part with the rather large Indian he made it interesting to me and that munchkin lady,"" this house is clean! ""  Part 3 was alright since the parents are not in this one but the girl Caroline really died after the making of this film. I heard every sequeal that was made of Poltergeist, one of the original cast members really died! Spooky Huh?"
414,5.0,"I never saw the original nor read the book but I have to say that this is the best Carrie I've seen. The 90's sequel attempt was just insane, trying to make Rachel Carrie's sister. There was no prom, honestly the movie was so different other than it's attempt to be a sequel that it could of been entirely different movie, outcast girl with telekinesis goes on a rampage, only thing in common. And really, she wasn't so much of an outcast, seemed more like a wannabe punk girl to me.

Kind of in the way Rob Zombie took Laurie and made her a total punk, to the point you almost want to hate her sometimes, especially in RZ's sequel when she treats her luckily surviving friend like crap. Anyway on to THIS movie.

I did find Sue to be sympathetic but passive, she knew what was going to happen when Carrie opened her locker, yet she said nothing, even though it looked like she was dying to. Yet just a little while before that she was chanting with the girls while Carrie was freaking out and scared to death. After that, it seems like they wanted to portray Sue as this very mysterious character, attempting to make her look like she was playing serious mind games between everyone.

This was further pushed by Chris when she went to Carrie and in her own passive aggressive way was trying to manipulate the situation herself. It wasn't just plain and simple bullying, there were attempts at mind games, manipulations and it becomes a war of Chris Vs Sue with poor Carrie caught in the middle.

(I have to say I especially loved the moment Carrie implied Sue thought Chris needed botox. Not going to go into how that comes about.)

I have to say that Chris gets some character sympathy for me. I agree that she doesn't seem capable of doing what she ultimately does but I get the sense that there is peer pressure that comes into play. To begin with, she clearly has a controlling and even a bit of an abusive boyfriend and I think he is the main driver that actually makes the joke come to life, for Chris I merely think it was just an idea and she clearly had doubts, not to mention she was totally skittish when they went to the farm and later threatened to kill her if she talked, clearly freaking her out and ultimately attempting to run Carrie over despite Chris screaming for him to stop. The character was given a lot of vulnerabilities that comes out as the story progresses and gives the viewer a chance to possibly give this character sympathy. Yeah she went through with the big prank but this was less than an hour after this guy threatened to kill her, she came up with the idea but really beyond that, it was his thing despite his claims that it wasn't, he wanted it to happen. Emilie De Ravin did a fantastic job playing on these vulnerabilities that were spared to her character.

Meanwhile Sue still seems to be ominous and ultimately helps Carrie escape yet for me, personally, I don't feel like the character deserves any kind of winning badge. She still acts like shes playing mind games with the detective, she didn't have to be like that, seeming to purposely make him question her innocence in the whole ordeal by coming off as a chill, even antagonizing girl that doesn't appear to be as upset about everything as he thinks she should and rather actually going out of her way to seem not upset. The girl comes off as a total mind game even though as the viewer you can see through her like a glass window.

(Oh and her boyfriend was killed by the bucket that hit him on the head. Guess she didn't love him very much, huh? I have to give him props for killer aim though, if you haven't seen the movie, if you do, you will know what I mean. Props to the writers for this)

There was a lot of passive aggressiveness, manipulation and hot and cold in the bullying which wasn't always entirely aimed at Carrie. Yes she is the ultimate victim but I enjoyed the way the movie takes you into the popular drama ultimately triggered by the prom and the disrespect Chris perceived to get from Sue and ultimately their disagreement and the soap opera that followed, giving us time to see Carrie being left alone to be herself, to even grow as a character as an example, she learns how to use a computer for the first time while the popular ones are too self involved in their own crap.

It seemed much more authentic in it's representation of high school, it's not all perfect popular ones get along and target the less fortunate, much more BS goes on between and within the popular clique that distracts them from the outsiders and more often than not, bullying exists more so within the group than towards those outside of it. Out of them all though, I think Chris gets more sympathy from me by far, in a way being a victim herself but it doesn't justify anything she did prior to coming up with the idea to ruin Carrie at the prom, from the moment she came up with the idea, I think Billy took over power even if it wasn't shown, I go by the subtle things I see in what is shown.

Sue, yes she ultimately saves Carrie and gets her out of town, but then what? Does she drop her off beside the road in Florida? Bother to get her a hotel room? I heard this movie was supposed to turn into a television series (Honestly don't know how this movie in particular could be carried out long term to even make a series and it never happened so likely others felt the same.) But because it is what they planned which is why it had the ending that it did, it left so many things unanswered, things that could have bought Sue more justice but you never know what she does with Carrie after she takes off with her.

(Maybe they get a hotel and she kills Carrie in her sleep? In some twisted way, and she seems like a twisted person anyway, maybe she changed things around in her head and blames Carrie for her boyfriend, who she doesn't seem all that upset about, getting killed? By the way she acts through interrogation, she could possibly be filled with hate rather than any kind of sadness or remorse, for whatever reason, she is defensive, antagonizing and even appears manipulative through out when she didn't need to be. To protect Carrie, all she had to do was simply imply that she didn't and doesn't know anything. The detective does imply that Chris Vs Sue was a staged drama to ultimately get Carrie but I don't find that to be possible, especially when Chris interacts with others like her friend Tina or when she calls Billy on the phone. If the drama was staged, no need to keep them out of the loop, neither Tina or Billy would have gone out of their way to go tell Carrie. In fact Tina had no sympathy at all for Carrie no more than Billy which tells you something. I know Chris was being manipulative and passive aggressive but just seeing her even be able to pretend to be nice to Carrie makes me question if ever that they could of possibly connected.)

To make that point, unless I missed something, I don't think at that part of the movie Chris had any idea about Sue's plans to get her boyfriend to go to prom with Carrie, so why try to drive a wedge between Sue and Carrie? And given that there was Chris Vs Sue, it makes me wonder if in actuality Chris was trying to protect Carrie. I know that seems outlandish given how things go post this scene, maybe it wasn't care but rather territorial? Carrie was her victim and so long as Sue was divided from her as a friend, she no longer had rights to Carrie. Then again Chris was clearly BFF's with Tina and she didn't ever seem that close to Sue to ever begin with.

It's confusing and if anyone has any theories on this particular scene, let me know. For whatever reason, Chris wanted to drive Carrie away from Sue, could of possibly been due to Sue appearing to have sympathy for Carrie, yet then she would change her mind and go along with Chris. (Chris clearly picks up on this double sided play during the bowling alley scene in which Sue claims what they did was dumb and then in a seconds thought decides to go friendly and keep the peace with Chris in the moment and then the competition is totally driven home when the two couples stare each other down.)

Assuming that Sue did end up killing Carrie, out of misdirected revenge or possibly to prevent it from ever happening again, it makes the movie feel answered to me but Sue clearly isn't innocent, she did something that caused her to keep up her charade with the investigator and it didn't even seem just self protective by saying some of the things she said which could be seen as even antagonizing and then she clearly isn't heart broken.

As for Carrie? What does she do? She still has to have issues, maybe even more so by that point due to everything that happened, trauma, guilt, a self esteem practically destroyed from existence and no money or way to live, not even a realistic view of the world to even I don't think independently function in it properly, and she never graduates and that says what direction her future goes career wise as a burger flipper, though that is when her power really could come in handy. (I could see McDonald's burgers, about three or four in the air moving about as they make themselves via the power of her mind while she manually works on one with her hands.)

I like the way the movie was done, very true to high school experiences, I like that the bullies were given little moments that might cause a viewer to question a final opinion on them rather than readily hating them as they might anticipate doing when they start the movie, it was well done and portrayed well by a great cast with special congrats to Angela Bettis and Emilie De Ravin on their portrayals. Digging in deeper to other characters while still being able to bring it back around to center on the main plot, transitions and character developments coming along perfectly. Should be more than just TV worthy and actually given more widespread exposure to compete against the block buster 2013 remake.

While the effects were better, the cast nor the way it was written was done well at all and in fact every character from this movie was betrayed by that movie when each of them was changed so drastically (Chris going from blonde to dark hair?) Though that is minor in how the newest remake betrayed the wonderful ways that these characters were made in this movie. Chloe is a great actress, though I don't think the role was right for her, she didn't come off as an actual tortured soul to me. Angela with her drastically horrid appearance expresses her pain by it's self without any dramatics, just the fact that she didn't keep herself up, let her hair go as it would and most of the time it was an awful mess, horrible clothes, even by Good Will standards, classic severe depression, lack of knowledge about things she should of known about but was never properly taught and the repression of her mother that kept her from discovering things she should of.

Chloe just seemed to me, at worst, to be a plain Jane girl that wasn't glamorous enough to get into the popular crowd, she reminded me more of Rachel from ""Carrie 2: The Rage"" neither one looked awful, though Chloe is prettier than that girl from the 90's but that is where a huge problem is, she is way too pretty. In some high schools, especially these days, a lot of the cliche's are gone and Chloe is the kind of girl that by appearance kind of makes an example of that, you can be like a bunch of other kids, wear decent clothes, keep yourselves up and most just become equal faces in the crowd, none of them overly done or higher up. A lot of teens these days don't even have social ranks, if most can pull off being equal to each other, that is cool and that is just what they do and they go with the flow.

Kind of like the middle class outnumbering the rich and the poor by far. They are just middle, casual, normal people that blend in with each other much like the houses in suburbia. The only real thing that seems to trigger BS with these individuals is the things that they do rather than what they wear or how they act because they are mostly too similar to differentiate by that, and their drama's are hardly Hollywood. So a girl sleeps with another girls boyfriend? Might get in a fight but it's not always some big news story around, most of the time it's isolated and much goes on outside of school, over the net, at each others houses or on the phone.

Chloe seems like that type of girl to me, at least in her Carrie role, not an outcast, just a plain average girl, till prom and then all the real prettiness comes out. Even still, by prom appearance I would not rank her as someone who would suddenly get all eyes attention just by getting all dolled up. (Though she would due to celeb status but as a normal girl, I bet it wouldn't be like that.)

Okay done ranting, sometimes I can get really going, this movie is good though and I recommend it.

Small update! I think Gage Golightly would of made a better Carrie? I made a comparison collage below from Carrie and Gage's role in Teen Wolf."
415,2.0,"Brock Lesnar was spoiled,that why i think he left so early. First off he desroys one of the greatest tag teams the hardys(by himself) within his 1st month in the wwe,then in about his second month he wins KOTR then in his 4th month he goes 1 on 1 with the great one the rock(on this dvd) a 7 time champ in a decent match to win the undisputed title I believe he's the fastest rising star peroid. Then defeats the phenom in HIAC(on this dvd) is this guy getting a big push or what then losses to big show who has to cheat like for the first time in his career to win the title. Angle who is great has to have brock cheat for him to win the title. then WOW WHAT A SUPRISE BROCK WINS THE RUMBLE! LOL! of course. Then his 1st WM he main events, its no lie in a pretty good match(also on this dvd) especially when this big 295 pound idiot tries to do a shooting star press whis he supposed to perfected in OVWand lands flat on his face,but honestly seeing it live was crazy,we go back stage maybe he's so freaking dizzy he don't know he won the title because he's not happy he looks like he's drunk. then skip john cena and go to the strecher match with big show(also on dvd) in also a good match ok let's face he was good but everything was handed to him that's why i think he left things were too easy"
416,4.0,"Let's see if any of the reviews changes some minds! HUH!
I'll get started by saying that most of these matches weren't
bad, but - until the Chamber Match (I turned it off)
1st - No Matt Hardy vs. Zach Gowan (he was badly injured)
(just something Matt Hardy can use against the kid -)
Fatal Four-Way U.S Championship - Fun, and Awesome! = 4 stars
Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit vs. Rhyno vs. Tajiri
(This was great because no one was on the same page, and
their were no alliances between Benoit/Rhyno or Eddie/Tajiri)
(Lots of great back n forth action, cool maneuvers and
tight quickness, just didn't want this one to end)*
- WAS A GREAT OPENER
World Tag-Team Championship = 3 stars
Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance
(The Dudleyz totally should have won this, why can they not
block that stupid double move they use, it's so counterable)
No Disqualification Match = 1 star (at the least)
Shane vs. Bischoff
(Nothing really made this No Disqualification)
(And this so-called match, wasn't anything)
Undertaker vs. A-Train = 3 stars
(Great match, just like Taker vs. Cena at Vengeance)
(The Taker is just so amazing, especially with his back
against the wall, and forced to fend him off with an injury)
No-Holds Barred Match = 2 stars (not much GOOD, action)
Rob Van Dam vs. Kane
(Even with the stipulation, nothing really made a difference)
(Some ladder use, and a chair and the steel steps - that's all)
(Kind of a pre-empt to the big match at Unforgiven)
WWE Championship = 3.5 stars (not better than Wrestlemania)
Brock Lesnar vs. Kurt Angle
(With a twisted side to him, Brock's a muscle nutcase)
(Kurt never gave up hope, and finally made Brock - TAP)
(Great action though, kind of similar to Wrestlemania!)
AND NOW ON TO THE FAIRLY WORTHLESS - CHAMBER MATCH
Jericho vs. Triple H vs. Goldberg vs. Michaels vs. Nash vs. Orton
-Let me explain some key points!
-This was nothing, I repeat nothing like Survivor Series?
-Eliminations were almost all by Goldberg?
-Everyone was gone way too freaking quickly, and was short)
-Triple H cowering inside the secondary chamber - wussy!
-Nash is nothing special, neither was Michaels in this thing
-And I still can't believe Orton didn't even attempt to win
 the damn title (Triple H has a sick noose on these guys)
-Plus Goldberg was totally floored after this ended, beaten
 and totally bloodied, will someone arrest HHH for battery???
-You want to see something better, watch women fight...
(But the one-on-ones and fatal four-way are worth it)"
417,2.0,"This wasn't scary at all.  If anything it taught me about tree hunting.  I just found it to be 'meh'.  Two grown.... emphasis on grown men who are freaking out about screams in the woods.  Okay .... ummmm, it was just so boring.  At least give me some flash back history rather than some local legend talk.  A movie that wasn't quite 90 minutes and could honestly have been finished in about 60 minutes.  The first 20 minutes was about NOTHING."
418,5.0,"In 1998, a new comedy called ""Will & Grace"" made its official debut on US comedy channel NBC. The series was widely talked about. I live in the UK, and Will & Grace has only been on our television screens for little over two years, but - as in America - the show has made a huge impact and formed huge fanclubs amongst both the gay and straight communities. Seasons 1 and 2 have been available in the UK for around a year, so I think it's about time the show is released on DVD in America!

Will and Grace are best friends who are both very close. Everything about their friendship is perfect for them to be a romantic couple, except for one problem - while Grace is straight, Will is gay. Will Truman (Eric McCormack) is a supercool lawyer who loves Grace as a friend, but nothing more. He is a rather strange character, but seems very grounded and comfortable with his sexuality. Grace Adler (Debra Messing) is a sassy, smart and successful interior designer. She is very dedicated and disciplined when it comes to her professional life, but her personal life isn't nearly so together, and Will is her stabilising force. She's a little neurotic, and she knows Will is the only person who understands her and can help her put things into perspective. Besides this, Grace is also a lot of fun, and her humour helps balance Will's more serious personality.

Will and Grace also have to cope with their two long time friends, Jack and Karen. Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) is a jobless and very hyper camp gay guy. He is highly neurotic, extremely outspoken, a little bitter, maybe even borderline obsessive-compulsive. However, underneath all that, he is a caring soul and a good friend to Will. Karen Walker (Megan Mullally) plays Grace's socialite assistant. Karen is always confident that her way is the right way, and that she gives brilliant advice. She is so happy just being who she is, and who she is so completely inappropriate that it can't really be fathomed.

With the first episode of Season 1, ""Pilot (Love And Marriage),"" Grace is preparing to finish with her slob of a boyfriend Danny, but he proposes! The conclusion to whether or not Grace goes through with it is hilarious, and it fits in perfectly with the follow-up episode, ""A New Lease On Life."" Grace is looking for apartments, but puts forth an idea to move in with Will. In ""Head Case,"" Grace comes up with an idea to expand Will's two bathrooms, but this idea soon turns into a living nightmare! In ""Between A Rock And Harlin's Place,"" Jack is rehearsing for his one-man play Just Jack! Karen offers her advice in a hilarious dance scene, while Will and Grace have serious issues about a client who is looking for a new apartment.

In ""Boo! Humbug,"" Karen reluctantly agrees to storm the streets on Halloween with Jack, but she ends up having much more fun than him with a group of Drag Queens! In ""William Tell,"" Jack lets slip to Grace about a guy that Will had an affair with a guy when he was in a long-term relationship with Michael. In ""Where There's A Will, There's No Way,"" Jack is in serious trouble. He has forgotten to pay his taxes and now his gym membership is under threat! In ""The Buying Game,"" Grace wants to buy her studio, but things turn sour when Will intervenes. Meanwhile, Jack is finding his massage training a bit too hands on with Karen. In ""The Truth About Will And Dogs,"" Will becomes obsessed with a pet dog. In ""The Big Vent,"" Jack is freaking out because Karen says his new play stinks. Meanwhile, Will and Grace are totally obsessed with the interesting conversations from the apartment below that they can hear through their heating vent. In ""Will On Ice,"" Jack and Karen strike up an unlikely friendship when discussing ice skaters, while Will's birthday is set to turn out badly again - and he can't even get a cowboy cake!

In ""My Fair Maid-y,"" Grace is freaking out thinking that she has lost all creative inspiration she ever had for interior designing. It's not long before Will's cleaning lady is claimed as Grace's saviour. In ""The Unsinkable Mommy Adler,"" Grace's mother shows up with an outrageous suggestion that Will and Grace should get married! In ""Big Brother Is Coming Part 1,"" Grace is trying to re-unite Will with his brother who cut him out of his life years ago. In ""Big Brother Is Coming Part 2,"" Grace appear to have made a mistake in her attempts to re-unite Will with his brother. In ""Yours, Mine Or Ours,"" Will and Grace argue over a guy who has separately invited them both to dinner.

In ""Secrets And Lays,"" the whole four go to stay in a log cabin for a weekend. Grace sets it up as a solution for Will's 'Split With Michael' Anniversary, but a blast from the past threatens to blow her cover. In ""Grace Replaced,"" Will is off seeing another woman while Grace is extremely busy. Is Grace a little jealous? In ""Will Works Out,"" Jack joins Will's gym but this leads to all sorts of problems for Will and his reputation with clients who also go to his gym. In ""Saving Grace,"" Grace potentially lands a huge deal with a male client, but Will has to go out with him for Grace to be successful in her deal. In ""Alley Cats,"" Will and Grace have to curb their competitive streaks when they stand to lose their friends, whilst Jack is performing CPR on Karen.

Will & Grace is a fairly new comedy in the UK, and its popularity is just soaring, and we're only on Season 3! The show has longevity, and that's what will make it one of the most popular sitcoms in history. Will's crazy moments, Grace's wacky situations, Jack's flamboyant attitude and Karen's hilarious one-liners are all in this collection for you to treasure forever. Buy the Season 1 Collection of Will & Grace now!"
419,5.0,"If you like REALLY bad horror movies, this is the one for you! This is serious ""So bad it's good"" material, on a ""Worst of the worst"" scale. It's monumentally horiffic in every way. It's about mutant rats and of course, they start killing everyone...Great stuff...You name it, it has it, all the elements that make a horrible horror movie: Cheesy script, bad acting, gratuitous sex scene, bad gore, fake looking rat suit, fake sounding dialogue, holes in the storyline and super corny ending. The even more hilarious thing to do is to watch it with the directors commentary on the DVD! It's priceless! Lines like, ""We had to try to make the rats look scary, so we blew cold air on them to make them run."" I laughed so hard...And so will you if this is your thing. DO NOT watch this unless you are into cheesy movies! If you are looking for a 'good' horror movie don't watch this and don't watch it if you want to be scared. It's too freaking funny to be scary!"
420,4.0,"i had never heard an inkling about this movie until one guy at work told me about it. the only thing i knew was the main character was that one dude from Scary Movie 2 that was in a wheelchair and had the cock eyes. i didn't have high expectations since i never even heard of it.

surprise surprise! this freaking movie was funny. it borders on dumb redneck humor mixed with dumb and dumber, or something like that. there were a lot of memorable quotes and characters and that is something i didn't expect. i figure if you know about it then you probably enjoyed it enough to be entertaining. i know i did. for those of you who hadn't watched this, it is slightly offensive but worth a look."
421,5.0,"America's craziest family is back, and this time they're even funnier than the first season! I absolutely am addicted to this show. I can watch it over and over without ever getting sick of it. In an age where funny television shows are a dying breed, this one stands out from the rest of the reality tv/ comedy mush out right now. From Ozzy's battle to catch Moby Dick (um, fish don't like cheese, but whatever), to Kelly freaking out about her newfound fame, to Jack... well, being Jack, and of course Sharon (who at the time this season was taped was still battling cancer) who always just says whatever she wants (yay Sharon); this is a family that never ceases to have an interesting story to tell. They're the Beverly Hillbillies of the millennium (and I mean that in a nice way) - they have this balance of being just like any given American family - just as dysfunctional and crazy - only they have millions of dollars and cameras following their every move. It's basically the story of your family if your dad had been a 70's rock star.
The DVD itself is mostly like the first one. It has all 10 episodes of the season plus the option to turn on commentary by Sharon and either Aimee, Kelly, Ozzy, or Sharon's 4th child, Mimi (or Minnie?) the dog. The commentary isn't remarkable, though if you've seen all of the episodes a billion times (like me) you can just switch it on for something different while you watch the episodes. They don't say much (Sharon mostly says ""I haven't seen this"" or ""Oh my g-d, I can't believe they put that in""). I'm not sure why they thought it was a good idea to have Aimee do commentary because all she does is say how stupid her family is and criticize whatever she sees. Ozzy will occasionally mutter and say ""testing, testing,"" Kelly offers a few insights, and Mimi (or Minnie?) the dog will occasionally bark. There are a few 'bonus' clips of the family that were cut from the episodes, which are ok. There are a few games which are also mildly entertaining. The slightly amusing Ozzy translator (subtitles that can play during an episode whenever Ozzy speaks) is also back.
The bottom line... this is one of the funniest shows on tv and a fun DVD to have around to pop in and watch when you're bored or just sick of watching all of those other 'reality' shows. I got my entire family hooked on it, even though they are about the last people you'd expect to enjoy watching a dysfunctional rock star family on tv... but it's a show that can appeal to all types."
422,1.0,"I can't understand all of the four and five star ratings.  Are you freaking serious?!?!  This movie was HORRIBLE!  The acting was atrocious!  Only ONE Howling movie was good and that was the first one with Dee Wallace.  Every other movie went down the drain after that, and this one is no different.  I can't stress enough just how HORRIBLE this movie was.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.  If you do, you'll be sorry.  I certainly am.  OMG....the acting!  Geeeez this movie was a stinker to the 100th power...."
423,5.0,"While reading up on scenes that made people jump, one that often came up was 2 from the Eye, a Japanese film made a couple of years ago. Going to the video store, I thought ""I doubt they'd have it but let me go look for it anyway"" and sure enough I found it so I got that and didn't regret it one bit. While the story isn't original and it kind of peters out after awhile, it's anchored by a solid performance and genuinely creepy moments throughout the film.

Mun has been blind since the age of 2. In her late 10's/early 20's(it's never specified), she undergoes a cornea transplant, letting her see finally. And everything is great and she's quite excited over it. That is until weird people start showing up and freaking her out which makes her wonder: just whose eyes did she get? Helping her is a psychiatrist who wants to believe her but is burdened by his more-than-friends feelings for her.

The film isn't that original as there have been several films based around being in possession of a haunted something. The film is of course to get comparisons to the Sixth Sense but that's an incredibly unfair statement since besides the ghost and the psychiatrist thing, they're quite different. The only thing that the Eye doesn't share with Sixth Sense is strong scenes start to finish. You can almost pinpoint where this film goes from creepy to just kind of there. The ending, which rivals the Mothman Prophecies for the biggest end disaster I've seen, is effective and a nice capper.

Now, it is a horror film so does it scare you? It sure can. Of note are 2 particular scenes: Mun gets a creepy visitation during a calligraphy class and what's probably the creepiest elevator ride you'll be on. Also watch for a face on a subway that has actually not been accounted for. These scenes, as well as a hallway visit by an old woman will most likely chill you, or at least startle you cause the music's so loud. However at a certain point, the film becomes less creepy and becomes more story driven and it's here where it kind of falls apart.

The other anchor is Anjelica Lee(credited as Lee Sin-Je) who provides a strong emotional weight to the character where you'll start to worry about her safety(especially that elevator part). The only other significant role is her doctor friend who while not given much character, becomes someone Mun can rely on for help.

In another unnecessary remake idea, it's being redone with Renee Zellweger in the role of Mun. While the last half can need some touching up, this doesn't need to be remade: it's creepy enough as it is."
424,5.0,"A young Chinese violinist, blind since childhood, recieves corneal transplants and begins seeing ghosts and other troubling visions.  She starts freaking out until she winds up back in the hospital with a collapse. Only then does anyone begin to believe her. Her psychotherapist (who has fallen for her) agrees to help her and traces the donor to a Thailand village where they discover the donor was an extremely troubled girl who committed suicide. She was psychic and persecuted by ignorant villagers. Resolving the matter will be another issue. ""The Eye"" is a richly textured supernatural thriller with horror elements. The ghosts are believable and the heroine's plight is scarily presented. There's enough tension in this film to fill Shea stadium. Yet it is also a film of emotional depth and treats the subject matter with respect. It says that there are ghosts all around us and those that can see them for whatever reason should understand the reasons they're still here. In ""The Eye"", it's tragedy and unresolved emotional conflict that binds a troubled spirit (and some others as well) to this plane. Whether you're a believer or not, ""The Eye"" is a good thought provoker and a well made thriller with enough scares and disturbing images to give you nightmares. At it's core, it's a sensitive treatment of what could happen with our advanced approaches in organ transplants and the misguided beliefs that everything is either black or white. But there are shades of grey that most people choose to ignore. ""The Eye"" explores these ""grey areas"" very well. As it says in the film, ""The world is a beautiful place""...as long as you don't look too close. You may see a ghost."
425,3.0,"I'm kind of surprised after watching ""Suicide Club"" I actually didn't intend to at first. I saw the clip of the subway train jumping on the net like years ago and wondered where it was from but never cared to watch the movie. Some years later I check out a movie called Noriko's Dinner Table and this movie is referenced throughout it well the primary incident at least. I thought Noriko's Dinner table was pretty good strange but good so I thought I'd give this a try.

After reading reviews about how people were disappointed at Noriko's Dinner table for not being a direct sequel I honestly don't get why. Compared to the 2 Noriko's dinner table was by far a better movie because it was complete,quirky,deep, and entertaining. I expected the same when I watch suicide club but what could have been a great film just turned into a waste of time.

The first half of the movie starts off like a great film. Your genuinely interested in seeing what happens and solving the mystery. The film starts out with a group of girls jumping onto a railway. Probably what makes this movie famous and so talked about...then it has some odd occurrences with people killing themselves. The story has 3 main characters. 1. The cop, 2. The cute girl on the cover, and 3. The hacker chick. I only call them main characters because the events that happen to them are all turning points in the story. You start out following the cop which is by far the best part of this movie. **maybe spoiler nah not really** Something happens to him and the movie you were just watching ends right there. All of a sudden Suicide Club turns into a musical. This movie goes from Suspenseful horror to ""is this a joke?"" quick! Norkio's Dinner table had that same eerie yet goofy atmosphere but it had it throughout the movie. It didn't all of a sudden turn into a completely different movie half way through it.

The moment the rock star starts singing you can consider this film over. The movie killed it's own self. From there you jump to the 2nd Main Character the Hacker and for some reason you never know what becomes of her character. It's just like the writers forgot to finish her story. Then from there we go back to the cute girl on the cover. Who solves the mystery of Suicide Club then the movie gets even weirder then it just ends with another  lame song. I honestly thought people where killing themselves because they had to listen to that horrible ""Dessert"" Pop group and that freaking song ""call me"" that stuck in my freaking head! MAKE IT STOP! MAKE IT STOP! ""CALL ME DA DA DA DA DA DA"" ""MAIL ME DA DA DA DA DA!"" some one kill me!

Ahhhhh.... ok what was I saying now... That's right, I don't understand what the message was or what the point of this film was. I really don't get what this movie was trying to be. Noriko's Dinner Table said more about the suicide Club and what it was more than the movie ""Suicide Club"" only that in Noriko's Dinner table no one physically killed them selves they mentally killed themselves by acting as another person until they no longer could connect with who they once were. That and some other stuff it was a really good film. Suicide Club is just outright confusing. Once the 1st main character is out the scene the movie turns into something else that I wasn't interested in watching honestly.

I give this move 3 stars for the first half of it. It's too unique to give it less than that really (first half only other half is a POS!). The rest of the movie can kiss the Dvd case... not worth your time to watch."
426,5.0,"With an opening scene so shocking and disturbing as to be deemed infamous by many, 2002's Jisatsu saakuru (aka Suicide Club) grabs you by the throat, thrashes you around for an hour or so, temporarily morphs into some kind of weird rock and roll opera, gives you another kick in the solar plexus, and then bids you on your way - a little confused about what the heck you just witnessed.  The film will probably be just a little bit too open to interpretation for Western audiences, but by gum I freaking loved this movie.  While American horror directors seem to base all of their films on a shared database of five scripts, the Japanese are continuing to revolutionize the horror film day in and day out.

If you've ever heard of this film from director Sion Sono, you probably already know how the movie opens.  You've got a group of Japanese school girls (fifty-four in all) talking and giggling one minute, and then joining hands and jumping in front of an oncoming train the next.  I wanted to stand up and applaud right here in my room because it's so shocking and so well done.  Yes, we gorehounds can critique the manner in which the blood first appears, but no one can question the effectiveness of so much blood literally going everywhere.  Shinjuku Station almost instantaneously turns into Splatter City, baby.  The cops, led by Detective Kuroda (Ryo Ishibashi) investigate, but there's not much they can do about a mass suicide - not until the pattern of suicides continues to the point that they have to consider the possibility that someone is murdering these kids in some kind of incomprehensible way.  The second scene of multiple suicides is almost as unnerving as the first, and as time goes on individuals - including adults - begin taking their own lives, as well, a fact which sort of undermines any cult group theories.  A couple of mysterious informers - one calling herself The Bat and the other a child who continually clears his throat after every sentence - as well as a distinctly weird web site provide some insight into the subject, but the clues they provide are pretty cryptic.  Believe it or not, events actually take an even darker turn later in the film.

As is so often the case with Japanese horror, some of the deeper aspects of this film may not make perfect sense to those unfamiliar with Japanese culture, but I daresay any horror fan cannot help but be impressed by what goes on here (those who can't stomach a little blood and gore, though, probably won't last very long).  It's a really dark story, and some of its central images are of the type that you won't be forgetting any time soon.  I'll admit that the story didn't answer all of my questions, especially at the end, but this is horror on the cutting-edge and I loved every minute of it."
427,5.0,"I bought the region 2 copy off of amazon UK; freaking hilarious stuff.  All the classic moments you've only seen on YouTube are here: the James Bond improv, the ""Dan!"" incident, giving a deceptive tour of Bono's house, etc. Just as the layout of the DVD menus were quirky in the season 1 discs, so it is on this one.  Terrific extra features-- watch for the Anglian Lives special where they feature Alan a few years after he's moved out of the caravan."
428,2.0,"Ah, Leprechaun. Where would we be without ye? Well, we'd be better off without this sequel of a sequel. Apparently the ""hood"" premise was successful enough to warrant another one. The animated intro is promising, although it looks like it didn't make it past the animatics stage. I could probably find out what happened if I could be bothered to listen to an audio commentary (this movie, unbelievably, has two). It presents an interesting backstory to the Leprechaun myth that doesn't exist in any of the other films. Whatever character development gained here is squandered to nothingness with the remaining cast. Jamie is crazy nutzo over Lisa. I couldn't figure out why Lisa, Emily, and Rory hang around with this genius. And I never thought I'd miss those three no-talent ass-clowns from the last movie. The Leprechaun did have the decency to disrupt the mushy love story between Rory and Emily. But that was only temporary. Anyway, the Leprechaun wants his freaking gold!"
429,5.0,I think Weird Al is so freaking funny. This is a great laugh! You should really enjoy this. It has tons of his funny videos.
430,5.0,"This movie is freaking awesome. It has blood, guts, ninjas, cheesy dialogue, more ninjas, and David Carradine. I mean really what else do you need?"
431,5.0,This movie is freaking great and whats better is that it's coming for the psp so now you can watch it anywhere you go.
432,5.0,"1.  If you're a serious movie fan then you've probably spent some time hanging out with friends talking about waht you'd do if you made a movie.  Alot of people, myself included, talk about putting in icons from movies that we saw when we were younger but don't get alot of work anymore.  You'd suspect that alot of filmmakers have converstions like this before they break into Hollywood....but for some reason they never follow up on those ideas.  They've apparently forgotten what it's like to be a movie geek.  Not Q.T.  In Pulp Fiction he got Travolta.  In Jackie Brown it was Pam Grier.  And here in Kill Bill he got Carradine.  All 70s icons. You just know that Tarentino was sitting around at one point with some friends talking about how he'd get Carradine in his movie no matter how old he was.  Q.T. keeps it real.

2.  Game of Death costume.  Again, as with No. 1 it's the ultimate geek fantasy to pay homage to some of your favorite films in your own film.  The biker suit that the Bride wears during the House of Blue Leaves fight is a replica of Bruce Lee's suit in the movie, Game of Death.

3.  Hatori Honzo.  Sonny Chiba played a character named Hatori Honzo in a Japanese TV series called Shadow Riders.  The thing with this show, however, is that each season contained the same characters but a completely different story that had no relation to the previous one.  Q.T. decided to carry on the legacy of Hatori Honzo in his own movie by getting none other than Sonny Chiba himself to play Honzo.  A true testament to Tarentino's dedication to classic filmmaking.

4.  Gordon Liu.  What can I say.  If you've ever seen Shaolin Master Killer....then you were no doubt freaking out at the presence of Gordon Liu in BOTH Kill Bill volumes.

5.  The Fights!  Yeah we all know how incredible and intense the House of Blue Leaves fight is.  My favorite shot being the silhouetted fighting in front of the blue backdrop similar to scenes in Samurai Fiction.  But how about the brutal and realistic fight between the Bride and Vernetta Green?  Since when have you seen two women fight in a movie and end up ACTUALLY SWEATING AND BLEEDING afterwards?  Awesome.

Of course, there are many more reasons to love this movie....these are simple reminders as to why everyone should own this film."
433,4.0,"I have good things and bad things to say about this movie, just so no one would take this as a full on rant (cause it isn't) I'll first list what I liked about it.  I like the fact that this movie is a bit (note: bit) different than any movie I've seen so far.  Of course he's taken lots of different things from other film genres but what film doesn't nowadays?  Practially every film has nearly been done and done to death, can't fault QT for that.  I loved the Anime part for Cottonmouth's story.  The first fight scene with Copperhead was brutal and I loved it, it was wild and unfilm like which added a level of realism.
Now for the bad (or near bad)
After the kitchen knife fight I was expecting something along those lines throughout the film.  Meaning, the realism of that fight scene made me believe that most of the fight scenes would have that same level of realism to it.  But as the movie went along the scenes just got more and more cartoonish.  Like the blood shooting out of every chopped off limb. Maybe it was something QT was aiming for and therefore was done on purpose but it just didn't do much for me.  It brought me out of the ""realism"" of the brutality in the movie (which IMO would have been better) and brought it to a out of this world fantasy.  Once again something QT may have been aiming for but did nothing for me.  Now don't get me wrong, I still loved the fighting in the movie, I even loved The bride fighting Cottonmouth's 17 year old guard.  But still there was something off about this movie.  Uma Thurman was off for me.  When she stabbed a guy and lifted him up in the air I couldn't help but roll my eyes at that scene.  IMO I think ""The Bride"" should have been a more bada$$ hard as nails type woman, Uma looks like a mouse to me.  The only scene she was remotely believable as ""The Bride"" was the Kitchen knife fight.  There I was like ""Ok, this woman is ready to kill this b*tch""  But then as it all went practially in cartoon mode I was like ""Ok, This woman is ready to be a super hero""  Which seems to be what QT was aiming for since in the previews for ""Kill Bill 2"" it says something about her becoming a hero.  But still Uma was all wrong for this part, it was hard to buy her as a bada$$ killing machine.  IMO, she just didn't belong.  I guess I have to see this whole movie as a live action anime film which it basically seems to be the route it took.  As for the violence, I can't see how anyone could even take it seriously enough to get offended by it, it was like something out of a cartoon instead of something real.  Also how come none of the crazy 88 carried guns?! I'm quite sure it would have been really hard for Cottonmouth to become Queen of the Tokyo underworld with the  mediocre sword using crazy 88 as her backup, the other Yakuza clans would have just pulled out their guns and blew them all away, but apparently no one uses guns in Japan.  Uma battling over 40 or 50 guys with swords? Give me a break (but I still liked it.)  Also the 'Viper death Squad' and 'the Bride' should be featured on ""worlds dumbest assassins"", e.g. She (bride) accepts coffee from a women she tried kill two mins earlier and actually drinks it, Copperhead is too dumb to even poison the freaking cup.  'California Mountian Snake' is too dumb to just push the top of the needle down to inject the poison before answering the phone, Bill is too dumb to just let ""CMS"" kill her, Cottonmouth is too dumb to hire compentant men who carry guns.
  But still, overall I still enjoyed the film, I liked the music, liked the story (good old fashioned revenge!) and I enjoyed the characters all but Uma, actually one reviewer was right when they said the only interesting characters are the ones 'The Bride' is killing off.  Also I can't really feel for Uma's character, I mean, I understand why she would want revenge, the beginning was brutal, but still I can't really feel for her plight.  So I'll give it a 3 to maybe 3 1/2 stars."
434,4.0,"Before digging into the nuts and bolts that make up ""Detour,"" let's briefly summarize a couple of movies. Wes Craven's low budget masterpiece shocker ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" released to universal outrage in 1977, examined the tragic series of incidents that befell a family after their mobile home broke down in the desert. A gaggle of inbred cannibals (of course) moved in for the kill, and the movie quickly descended into a struggle between civilization and barbarism as the surviving members of each clan battled it out for supremacy. O.K. Now, in 1974 a struggling filmmaker named Tobe Hooper released a rather bloodless little film called ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" a movie about a group of kids stranded out in the middle of nowhere facing down a family of lunatic cannibals (Hmmm, a pattern). The movie quickly descended into a battle between civilization and barbarism as one of the kids battled against an evil beyond reckoning. Why am I summarizing these two unrelated movies in a review for a flick made in 2002? Because ""Detour"" borrows heavily from both of these efforts. Before you start groaning, however, let me say that this movie manages to do something most imitators don't do--it entertains despite its derivative qualities.

The movie opens with a five-minute sequence showing two young ladies (one of them the adorable Tiffany Shepis clad in a skintight outfit and big boots--worth the price of admission alone) dying horribly at the hands of some lunatic sporting a hook-like device attached to his arm. Then the film moves into a series of quick cuts showing a bunch of gyrating bodies at a rave out in the desert. How do we know the party takes place in the desert? Because the following scenes show a group of kids moseying down the highway in the middle of the desert, a group of kids that attended the aforementioned rave. Let's introduce the cannon fodder...er, the characters, shall we? We've got a mouthy Goth type chick named Cashie (Kelsey Wedeen), Neil (Brent Taylor), Lee (Ryan De'Rouen), Angela (Renee Madison Cole), Harmony (Jill Jacobs), her best friend Tara (Ashley Elizabeth), and Loopz (Aaron Buer). Loopz, I should note, initially ranks as one of the most irritating characters in the history of cinema. He's a white guy who thinks he's black, meaning he talks like a ghetto thug. Seriously. Lots of ""Yo's!"" and ""Aiights"" tumble from his mouth every other second. He's so irritating, in fact, that an extra on the DVD consists of nothing more than twenty or thirty seconds of him spouting off. They call this something like ""The most irritating twenty seconds in film history."" Funny!

Anyway, I'm getting off the point. Not that there's much of a point to this movie, mind you, but we'll slog through the rudimentary details anyway. The kids decide to head off the beaten track in search of a hidden cache of Mary Jane. Instead of finding it, they roll right into Nightmare Alley. A stop at a gas station inhabited by a younger version of Crazy Ralph from ""Friday the 13th"" (let's call him Crazy Petey) supplies the requisite warning about doom and gloom to come, as well as showing us the girls bouncing around in shorts so tight that I worried parts of their bodies would fall off for lack of circulation. After this nonsense, it's time for the obligatory ""run off the road and get stuck"" scene. I think it's Lee, Neil, and Angela that eventually wander off, but I'm not sure. Names aren't important. All three perish in extremely horrible ways, of course, thanks to a group of inbred freaks that drink some sort of liquor full of chemicals. In no time at all, the survivors back at the trailer--Loopz, Harmony, Tara, and Cashie--must contend with increasingly sinister incidents, such as finding weird symbols painted on the side of the mobile home, Cashie drinking some tainted fluid and freaking out, and a nighttime invasion that results in an abduction. I won't spoil the rest except to say if you've seen ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" you've seen the conclusion to ""Detour.""

A bigger bundle of cliches I've nivver seen, as my Irish ancestors might have said. ""Detour"" wallows in scenes and characters ripped off from other films. Inbred cannibals? Check. Wackos in a pickup truck chasing down a character? Yup. Heroic chick saving the day? You bet. False scares around every corner? Oh yeah! Mindless banter and banal insults dished out with the rapidity of machine gun fire? Uh huh. It's all here, but for some reason it works better in ""Detour"" than in all the other low budget crud currently clogging the arteries of horror fans the world over. Loopz, who starts out as an irritant on par with bamboo shoots stuffed under your fingernails, actually becomes an amusing--nay, endearing--presence. You could've knocked me over with a feather when I realized I liked this character! Congratulations to actor Aaron Buer for giving a stereotype some serious dimension. And then there's the gore, which really works in this movie. Legs ground into chowder under tires, more than one impalement (!), and stabbings and slashings galore gave the movie added chops. ""Detour"" is a delight for gorehounds.

Like most low budget productions on DVD, extras runneth over. A commentary track with director Steve Taylor, a behind the scenes documentary with plenty of cast interviews and goofing off (oddly titled ""Hell's Highway,"" a name they should've gone with), cast auditions, trailers, and an extended opening sequence that adds even MORE gore to the shenanigans (re: innards). I got a huge surge out of seeing someone finally do a low budget ripoff right, but I'm still going to give this one four stars since it took a long time to get to the inbred cannibals. Nonetheless, if you love horror like I love horror, give this one a go posthaste."
435,4.0,"You will NOT find the meaning of life in this movie, but if you want to veg out and enjoy a good action flick, this is it. When I saw the opening shots of Hong Kong, all glitzy with neon lights, I knew this movie was going to be cheesy. The assassin with her ""controller"" guiding her through the job reminded me of Max Headroom circa 1987, and I decided to enjoy this movie for what it was.

The action scenes were excellent despite the CGI effects of flying bullets and shattering glass. My only complaint was the soap opera-like plot line where Ai Lin wants to stop being an assassin because she fell in love. (Cue sappy music!) And I can't believe that her wholesome boyfriend would have handled things so easily when he found out what she did for a living.

I also wish there was a little more background on the sisters becoming assassins--all we know is that businessmen broke into their house (to steal her father's invention) and killed their parents and one of the businessmen inexplicably turned on his partners and gave one of the girls a gun to fight back. Oh, and after Ai Lin died, her sister cried for what seemed like ten minutes and it was freaking depressing!

Still, the action was great and the most of the movie was fast paced. And as a woman, it's nice to see women kick butt on screen. (I'll ignore the tight clothes and the tops that are strategically slashed during fighting, revealing the heroins' bras.)

Don't take this movie too seriously, just enjoy it!"
436,5.0,"I'm not going to review the film itself (but if you must know, I think it's freaking awesome - which is readily apparent, considering I have the regular dvd, the extended unrated cut dvd, and now this blu-ray version).

Now, onto the disk itself.  First, the cut of this movie seems to be the extended unrated cut, or something similar to it, so if you missed out on that the first go around, this is your chance to see it.

The transfer, in my humble opinion, is absolutely lovely.  Everything looked great on my 60 inch Sony Bravia.  I especially love how much additional kick the blue-ish color palette (chosen intentionally by the director) receives in this transfer.

If you haven't seen this movie yet (shame on you)...and you have a blu-ray player, this is the version I recommend you to get.  If you are just like me, who just plain loves the movie, then double dipping IMO is well worth it."
437,5.0,"Kate Beckensale plays Selene here, a vampire Death Dealer with an attitude the size of her body count.  She's a vampire assasin who's waging war with the Lycan (Werewolf) underworld.  Theres one problem.  The Werewolves are searching for a man who may hold the key to both the vampire and Lycan societies...a key that could end their war forever.  So what do the vampires do...they need Selene to KILL him...but she can't, because she loves him.  It's a new  spin on Romeo and Juliet or Westside Story or whatever you want to say but it works no matter how you look at it, it works and you know why?  Because Len Wiseman knows how to make a great movie...the sets the shots the colors are just dark and ominous and A-freaking-mazing!!!  Kate Beckinsale is, I swear, the queen of goth.  Between the Underworld films and Van Helsing she's had her share of monster slaying.  All I have to say is she's great at it, and heck, she looks hit doing it.  Anyways, the film has a great flow, not a total action packed picture but it carries your interest and the whole air of the film is just stunning and dark and worth the time to take the ride so take it..."
438,4.0,"There's a tasteless attempt to make a joke out of the N-word in here that really falls flat and ought to have been cut from the movie...not that people should be forbidden to do the un-PC, but if you're going to use that terrible word, let it be in service of a joke that is at least believable if not funny. It takes you out of the reality of the movie.
And the reality is quite good in general. A strong thriller with a good cast. And there is some really good comedy in here. The policeman is just freaking hilarious.
All in all, good horror, with the trademark Eli Roth mercilessness."
439,4.0,"""Cabin Fever"" probably turned my stomach more than any horror film I have seen in a long time, which is actually intended to be a compliment when you consider how many of these films attempt to do so and only end up being laughable.  The premise has the virtue of not relying on anything supernatural.  A group of five college students head for a cabin in the woods so they can party hearty, but they run into a hermit (Arie Verveen) who has some flesh-eating disease that is getting really, really bad.  It will not surprise you that the kids end up trapped in the cabin and that some of them start coming down with the disease.  In case you are not clear on how this is going to happen lots of ominous music by Angelo Badalamenti and/or Nathan Barr is provided to reinforce the hints given by the camera.
The problem is that the moments of horror, such as when Paul (Rider Strong) discovers that Karen (Jordan Ladd) is sick, are not in the service of a better film.  It would be interesting to have one of these films in which you actually minded if these kids died off one by one.  First time director Eli Roth exhibits true technical competence, a clear sign that he was weaned on this genre, but he actually proves to be too good for his own good in this 2003 film.  Roth clearly has a sense of humor (check out ""Cabin Fever: The Family Version"" and the other special features on the DVD), but since he really creates some moments of true revulsion, the funny stuff seems out of place.  Splatter flicks tend to have a lot of humor in them because the horror ends up being so campy that you might as well pretend the whole film is a joke.  That is not the case here.  Ironically, the DVD comes with ""Chick Vision,"" where a pair of ""hands"" cover up most of the screen so it is difficult to see the bad stuff, which would actually convince you this is your standard low-budget splatter flick and not one that has moments that go for the jugular.
Another problem is that Roth is clearly working in homages to other classic films, from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to ""Evil Dead,"" that only serve to work against his own endeavor.  The locals are pretty much ""Deliverance"" rejects and part of the ending smacks too much of ""The Night of the Living Dead,"" further dispelling the film's best moments.  Then Roth tacks on a series of final ironies that strips away the remaining horror elements so that the scenes that had us freaking out seem like distant memories of another film.  Certainly Deputy Winston (Giuseppe Andrews) wandered in from some tacky low-budget horror film, apparently to further sabotage this one.  I have no doubt that Roth thought the comedy and the homages were necessary parts of this film, but after you have watched ""Cabin Fever"" review the film in your mind, take away those parts, and think about how long this film would have kept you up at night after watching it for the first time.
However, there is reason to believe that one day Roth is going to figure out how to either integrate the horror or abandon it completely, and make a horror film that could be one of the scariest of all time.  There are so many moments in ""Cabin Fever"" that show an understanding of true horror and are going to stick with you, that makes it clear the kid has got potential in this genre.  The only thing that might stop Roth is when he gets real money to make a movie, because that could actually stifle his creativity.  But I really think that if Roth were to stop referencing other works and moderate the humor, he would be the odds on favorite to make the horror film that would be ""The Exorcist"" for this generation."
440,3.0,"The one thing everyone must say about Audrey Wells' ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" is that it is visually stunning.  Restraint is completely abandoned in this Oprah-ready tale of a beautiful divorcee (Diane Lane) ""finding herself"" in the postcard-perfect Tuscan hillside.  Yes, this is a movie for those who sprinkle extra sugar on their cotton candy.

This is the kind of movie that won't give you a gorgeous shot of an old church -- rather, we'll give you a gorgeous shot of an old church on a picturesque Tuscan hillside as the camera peeks over a bank of photogenic sunflowers in full bloom.  Not content to show the gorgeous Diane Lane exchanging sweet nothings with a gorgeous Italian hunk on a gorgeous Italian beach, Ms. Wells feels obliged to throw a kitten -- yes, a freaking kitten -- into the scene for no reason other than to send the cuteness scale over the top.

Ms. Lane stars in this ode to returning to basics - it is revealing that noboby I've talked to about the movie knows her character's name.  In a plot device straight out of a gripe session on ""The View,"" Ms. Lane gets divorced by her philandering husband -- and thanks to California's heartless divorce laws, she ends up living in the divorcee's flat while he keeps the posh San Francisco house.  Massive depression ensues, as evidenced by Ms. Lane's furrowed brow.  Let's just say that the stellar acting job Diane Lane gave us in ""Unfaithful"" is nowhere to be found in ""Tuscan Sun.""

Ms. Lane's stereotypically supportive lipstick lesbian friends try to buck up her spirits by sending her on a trip to Tuscany -- but it's a gay trip, get it!  Actually, the gay tour offers one of the movie's few genuine laughs with its appellation, ""Gay and Away!""  Diane spots a ""for sale"" sign on a picturesque Tuscan villa and, after some hapless negotiating and some timely bird crap, she buys it.

We then enter a long series of scenes as Diane begins to restore the villa -- for those of you who were perhaps wondering if there would be a delightful parallel between the rehabilitation of the villa and Ms. Lane's personal rehabilitation, you won't be surprised.  Again, the movie ain't subtle.  Employing a trio of lovable Polish cardboard cutouts as laborers, Diane returns ""Bramasole"" to its villa-ish glory.  Naturally, after living in Tuscany for a few weeks, Ms. Lane discovers that she has already mastered Tuscan cuisine, and the movie gives us several shots of her presenting her friends and laborers with meals that could be on the cover of a Tuscan cookbook.  Unfortunately, ""Tuscan Sun"" is not that interested in food beyond its photogenics -- those looking for another ""Big Night"" will be horribly disappointed.

Of course, Ms. Lane must find her self romantically involved.  To say this aspect of the story is handled poorly is an understatement. Her realtor achieves a cinematic first -- he offers to sleep with Diane while simultaneously confirming his devotion to his wife.  And just about when the audience is expecting Diane to find herself a man, lo and behold she runs into a charming soul who looks like a champion Italian tennis player.

Several other sub-plots are handled in similarly skin-deep fashion.  This is the kind of movie that doesn't interject a serious love interest for Ms. Lane until the last five minutes, and he really only gets about two or three lines of dialogue . . . but visually the movie tells you that he is the one to complete our heroine.

All in all, ""Tuscan Sun"" is an inoffensive, light-hearted, beautiful romp through nonsense.  To borrow a Shakespearean title, ""Much Ado About Nothing"" completely fits.  That being said, the movie can play a role if you find yourself completely depressed (or lacking in travel plans) -- Tuscany is a wonderful tonic.  At least the movie got that right, if nothing else.

The DVD has virtually no extras to recommend it."
441,4.0,"Errr.. What happened to the other reviews on this I am sure there were more reviews. Anyway I love this collection. I loved Alien which annoyed me by freaking me out despite the fact that it is over 20 years old and the alien frequently looks fake by modern standards. I still get an adrenaline thrill from Aliens despite the fact it has less action than most modern action thrillers. I didn't like Alien 3 and hated alien resurection.
  So why am I giving this 4 stars? Well I love filmaking as much as I love films and this is an excellent view of what went right and wrong vs what was intended. I can see clearly why Alien 3 was a disaster waiting to happen and why Jean was the wrong man for Alien ressurection. I find that information invaluable."
442,4.0,"The reason I wanted to see this movie was to see if Patricia Clarkson was really as good she's been raved by the nation. She had previously captured my attention in Far From Heaven the year before. I was very touched by her performance, because her portrayal of a dying woman(Joy) trying to reconnect with her estranged daughter April(Katie Holmes). Her performance was both funny and emotionally impacting.
Katie Holmes was wonderful, because she effectively represents majority of runaways or abandoned adolensce these days. She looked great with all the funky hair and clothes, and her boyfriend Bobby(Derek Luke) is a sweet guy. Her [...] neighbour(Sean Hayes) was so pathetic, that he wanted a favor in return for borrowing his oven to bake the turkey. She eventually had to turn to her Chinese neighbours for help. It was funny at first, 'cause they didn't speak any English. Thank God, the turkey was baked on time.
Meanwhile, Joy,and her other ""good"" daughter, and her husband are on the way from out of town to visit April. Joy was freaking out the last minute. She kept thinking that it was not going to work, because she had no happy memory with April. When they got to the outside of the apartment building, they bumped into Bobby with blood on his face. They were shocked by the neighborhood, and her bleeding her bleeding Black boyfriend, and drove away simutaneously.
The moment Joy saw a little girl in the restaurant's restroom, she was instantly reminded of the years when April was a little girl, and she decided to go back by taking a ride from a biker outside the restaurant.
April was devastated, and just when she thought she was going to celebrate Thanksgiving with her neighbours, someone was knocking at the door.....This is the moment when everyone was smiling and crying at the same time.
I think it was so perfect to shoot this film with a digital camera, because it's a low-budget indie film, and it fell more real."
443,3.0,"I think I saw this once, without the scientific commentary, and it was fantastic.  I don't believe, as one reviewer said here, that you have to be more than an ""average joe"" to understand the commentaries by illustrious teachers, because what they're saying isn't that complex, and it's explained by well-drawn digital diagrams, etc.  In fact, the digital stuff is exquisite.  It's just too bad there's not more of it, and I think in the original I saw I loved it because it just went from one digital image to another, and the artistry was marvelous.  Frankly, I was shocked at how boring the scientific commentary was.  At the risk of sounding anti-intellectual (which I am not - I'm a writer and teacher myself) I have to wonder why these incredibly frumpy, lumpy, dumpy scientists were allowed to appear as themselves on what was otherwise a slick and attractive presentation (although there was nowhere near as much variety as there could have been - the repetitiveness of the imagery in this version nearly drove me mad).  What I'm saying is that if you are going to create a commercial film for mass consumption, at least make sure that your stars trim their hair, wear well-fitting clothing that at least camouflages a paunch, and get rid of of the absurd accessories, i.e., floppy, printed day-glow bow-ties and matching pocket handkerchiefs. The public is used to well-groomed celebrities and presenters, but that's not what I am talking about.  It's nice to see ""real"" people in commercial productions.  However - even ""real"" people can present a semblance of taste, when appearing before the public.  The only thing that redeems these geeks is the fact that they resemble, somewhat, the creatures they are describing, especially the giant squid at the end with eight klutzy legs and the pulsing blue light on its forehead: a very attractive millipod or whatever the freak it was.  Enough.  I just threw the freaking thing against the wall in frustration.  I suppose I'll have to write again and make amends for my rude commentary.  But really - is this thing actually a comedy?  By the end of it my husband I were writhing on the floor in hysterical laughter.  Jim Carey should do a take-off.  Love you, guys; geniuses.  You made me laff."
444,2.0,"I watched Hr Pufnstuff with fascination as a child. So I had some some credits on my credit card and decided to use them to buy this package. Well, the package made it to my house but the cheap thin plastic was busted on both sides and the cardboard was crushed too. I'm getting a refund on this product and I get to keep the busted set. But just let me express my frustration. The packaging is CHEAP. The cardboard use for the case and the packaging is about half the thickness of your usual dvd set. And the plastic is pretty thin as well. So this is one of the reasons the set arrived completely busted all to heck. And you should see how gawdy and LOUD the packaging is. There are freaking silly pictures all over the packaging. In short, IT'S UGLY. There are simply too many stupid pictures all over the packaging. The dvds will fit securely in the plastic though. The dvds will not fall out but the product is simply UGLY. Whoever devised this packaging just went CRAZY with pictures. This is easily the UGLIEST dvd set I have ever purchased. I can appreciate the use of the pictures it's just that the packaging is VERY BUSY. It is OVERLOADED with pictures. It is ridiculously overloaded with pictures. It just looks absurd and stupid. So, for me I felt ridiculous just playing with the package. The creators of this reissue should have used sturdy cardboard/paper, thicker plastic and they should have TONED down the images. This set has IMAGE OVERLOAD making it look retarded.

This review is just for the packaging. The dvds seem to be of the usual quality. It is three dvds which are not thin or cheap. So the dvds are better than the packaging.

And if I reorder this package I might consider buying the older version, which I hope is complete with the full show introduction with the boy running down the hill to find the ship."
445,5.0,I freaking love this movie. Extremely good movie. This movie gets really deep. Teaches kids what it's really like in the real world. And what can happend to them in the future. Five stars :)
446,3.0,"I will fully admit that I checked out ""Hangman's Curse"" because the idea of a Christian horror film is rather intriguing.  By ""Christian horror film"" I do not mean something like ""The Exorcist,"" where priests show up to save the day, but one in which the heroes are true believers and faithful followers who quote Scripture and call on God for all matters and not those that serve as the basis for horror films.

""Hangman's Curse"" is based on a novel by author Frank Peretti, who is obviously an interesting character as revealed by both the behind the scenes features and his appearance in the film as the eccentric Dr. Algernon Wheeling, the scientist who provides necessary exposition and explanations.  This is the first of several stories about the Veritas Project, a family of investigators who are interested in getting to the truth.  So the Springfield make their way to Rogers High School, where strange things are happening to several students who play on the school football team and everybody is blaming the ghost of Able Frye, a student who hung himself in the school ten years ago.  We know that the kids who are freaking out are doing so because they see those around them turned into frightening figures.

So the Springfields go under cover.  Father Nate (David Keith) will work as a janitor at the school, mother Sarah (Mel Harris) will be in the counseling office, Elijah (Douglas Smith) gets to be the smart kid this time while sister Elisha (Leighton Meester) will play the ordinary kid.  What they discover is that Rogers High is divided into the jocks, the geeks and the Goths and that survival of the fittest is literally the order of the day according to the football coach.  But apparently Able's ghost is willing to go after members of all three groups.  This is all anybody is talking about at school and finding the figure of the hangman in your locker means you are next on the list.

The Goths decide the thing to do is worship Able and hope he goes after their tormenters, and the pivotal scene in the film comes when a Goth chick Crystal Sparks (Andrea Morris) falls victim.  At that point the leader of the Goths, Ian Snyder (Jake Richardson), decides to hang him self to appease Able.  Elijah is trying to stop him and keeps shouting about how it is not Able that is threatening Ian but someone with a different name.  Could it be Satan?  That is not merely a flip rhetorical question but one that is pivotal to ""Hangman's Curse"" because your assumption is not only that the answer is ""yes,"" but that we will see evidence of such that will get us to the familiar ground of horror films.

What is interesting to me is that ""Hangman's Curse"" does not go in what you might think is the obvious direction, which, ironically, might end up being the film's weakness.  That is because while on the one hand I appreciate the way the story keeps things in the realm of reality, on the other the truth that is revealed (remember, ""Veritas"" is Latin for ""truth"") is rather unbelievable, simply because it is really complicated.  I appreciate the idea that Darwinian survival of the fittest could be based on brains rather than brawn, but the truth here almost makes Rube Goldberg look sane and gets the rating on this one down to three stars.  But if rationality goes off the deep end here, I think most people will admit they get the religion right, which Peretti would have to think is more important.

I would add another star to the rating for ""Hangman's Curse"" if it can be shown to a group of teenagers who get to discuss the movie after watching it.  I say that because I think even those who look at what happens here with disdain would have to admit that there are some serious issues involved.  I can easily imagine several interesting discussions that would come from ""Yes, but..."" propositions regarding the issues and topics handled in the film.  Ultimately, what separates this 2003 film from the rest of the horror genre is not the beliefs held by its heroes but rather that there are actually things worth discussing when the whole thing is over."
447,4.0,"There's a tasteless attempt to make a joke out of the N-word in here that really falls flat and ought to have been cut from the movie...not that people should be forbidden to do the un-PC, but if you're going to use that terrible word, let it be in service of a joke that is at least believable if not funny. It takes you out of the reality of the movie.
And the reality is quite good in general. A strong thriller with a good cast. And there is some really good comedy in here. The policeman is just freaking hilarious.
All in all, good horror, with the trademark Eli Roth mercilessness."
448,4.0,"""Cabin Fever"" probably turned my stomach more than any horror film I have seen in a long time, which is actually intended to be a compliment when you consider how many of these films attempt to do so and only end up being laughable.  The premise has the virtue of not relying on anything supernatural.  A group of five college students head for a cabin in the woods so they can party hearty, but they run into a hermit (Arie Verveen) who has some flesh-eating disease that is getting really, really bad.  It will not surprise you that the kids end up trapped in the cabin and that some of them start coming down with the disease.  In case you are not clear on how this is going to happen lots of ominous music by Angelo Badalamenti and/or Nathan Barr is provided to reinforce the hints given by the camera.
The problem is that the moments of horror, such as when Paul (Rider Strong) discovers that Karen (Jordan Ladd) is sick, are not in the service of a better film.  It would be interesting to have one of these films in which you actually minded if these kids died off one by one.  First time director Eli Roth exhibits true technical competence, a clear sign that he was weaned on this genre, but he actually proves to be too good for his own good in this 2003 film.  Roth clearly has a sense of humor (check out ""Cabin Fever: The Family Version"" and the other special features on the DVD), but since he really creates some moments of true revulsion, the funny stuff seems out of place.  Splatter flicks tend to have a lot of humor in them because the horror ends up being so campy that you might as well pretend the whole film is a joke.  That is not the case here.  Ironically, the DVD comes with ""Chick Vision,"" where a pair of ""hands"" cover up most of the screen so it is difficult to see the bad stuff, which would actually convince you this is your standard low-budget splatter flick and not one that has moments that go for the jugular.
Another problem is that Roth is clearly working in homages to other classic films, from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" to ""Evil Dead,"" that only serve to work against his own endeavor.  The locals are pretty much ""Deliverance"" rejects and part of the ending smacks too much of ""The Night of the Living Dead,"" further dispelling the film's best moments.  Then Roth tacks on a series of final ironies that strips away the remaining horror elements so that the scenes that had us freaking out seem like distant memories of another film.  Certainly Deputy Winston (Giuseppe Andrews) wandered in from some tacky low-budget horror film, apparently to further sabotage this one.  I have no doubt that Roth thought the comedy and the homages were necessary parts of this film, but after you have watched ""Cabin Fever"" review the film in your mind, take away those parts, and think about how long this film would have kept you up at night after watching it for the first time.
However, there is reason to believe that one day Roth is going to figure out how to either integrate the horror or abandon it completely, and make a horror film that could be one of the scariest of all time.  There are so many moments in ""Cabin Fever"" that show an understanding of true horror and are going to stick with you, that makes it clear the kid has got potential in this genre.  The only thing that might stop Roth is when he gets real money to make a movie, because that could actually stifle his creativity.  But I really think that if Roth were to stop referencing other works and moderate the humor, he would be the odds on favorite to make the horror film that would be ""The Exorcist"" for this generation."
449,4.0,"Bram Stoker's vampire novel has been remade dozens of times, but perhaps the best adaptation is the classic Bela Lugosi version. And ""Dracula - The Legacy Collection"" collects not only Lugosi's movie and the Spanish version, but three inferior sequels that are still moderately entertaining -- basically a vampire-lover's delight.

A solicitor, Renfield (Dwight Frye), is travelling to Count Dracula's castle for a real estate deal, despite the locals freaking out and crossing themselves whenever Dracula's mentioned. He soon finds out why -- the Count (Lugosi) is a vampire, who enslaves a mad Renfield to his will. Soon after, a ship with a dead crew (and Renfield and Dracula in the hold) arrives in England.

Soon Dracula has moved into his new home, Carfax Abbey, and is insinuating himself with the Seward family -- and especially with pretty Lucy Westenra, who dies of blood loss and is reborn as a vampire. Only the intervention of the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) can stop Dracula's attacks in London.

Then there's the Spanish-language one, which is virtually identical and was filmed on the exact same sets, during the hours when the English-language one was not being shot. It's incredibly good, and although it lacks that iconic intensity that Lugosi brought the English-language film, it's full of atmosphere and amazing acting.

And there's an immediate sequel, ""Daughter of Dracula,"" about a beautiful Transylvanian vampire -- created by Dracula -- who comes to England seeking a way out of her eternal torment, now that her ""father"" has been permanently killed. But her sinister servant wants to keep her enslaved to her bloodlust.

Then there are two inferior sequels: ""Son of Dracula,"" which is basically a whittled-down plot set in the early twentieth century, with an exceptionally wooden ""Count Alucard"" played by Lon Chaney Jr. He moves in next to an heiress's house, kills her father, and marries her, so it's up to her ex-boyfriend to save the day.

And finally there's ""House of Dracula,"" in which the very popular Dr. Edelmen (Onslow Stevens) gets two requests for supernatural cures from some kind of miraculous mold: Count Dracula (John Carradine), and the wolfman Lawrence Talbot (Lon Cheney Jr). Talbot is suicidal over his transformations, and Dracula is secretly pursuing Edelman's vacuous nurse and driving the good doc insane. And they stumble across Frankenstein's monster too.

It's a mixed bag, vampirewise. The first two are among the best classic horror ever made, but the sequels deteriorate as they proceed -- ""Daughter"" is a very solid movie on its own, and ""Son"" is cliche and wooden. By ""House,"" they've decided to just be silly and campy, and throw in as many fictional monsters as they can fit in.

The direction in the first three movies is quite solid, eerie and gothic, with plenty of memorably haunting moments (""I never drink... wine,"" Dracula says smilingly). Lots of cobwebbed castles, foggy London streets, bats and women drifting around in white dresses. The last two are strictly B-movie fare in terms of directorial skill, and some moments like the flaming mine are simply awful.

Lugosi is simply brilliant as Dracula. While not the stately, imposing figure that Stoker described, he has a blazing intensity that works just as well, as well as great charm. Carlos Villaras is not quite as good, but does an excellent and faithful job in the Spanish version. Carradine doesn't seem to be trying too hard, and Cheney just doesn't work as a vampire (though he's glorious as Talbot).

These actors are backed by casts that range from the sublime (creepy, bug-eating, cackling Frye) to the ridiculous (the dreamy-eyed, hammy nurses in ""House""). Gloria Holden deserves special kudos for her tormented, bisexual vampiress torn between good and evil, and Edward Van Sloan as Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing.

""Dracula - The Legacy Collection"" has a dud and a campy monsterfest, but the first three movies are divinely dark horror/suspense movies. Definitely worth getting and enjoying."
450,1.0,"Horrid movie.  Bad script.  Bad acting.  Bad everything.  Shams, you disappointed me.  What happened with The Happening?  Everything they teach you not to do in a screenplay, you did blatantly.

This is by far the worst of your movies.  I mean, this movie could have easily been done by some rookie filmmaker.

I felt none of the suspense, none of the intensity, no sense of curiosity.  I couldn't even feel the tension between Deschanel and Wahlberg's character.  This was a dead, flat movie.  It was just there.  Nothing was ""happening"".

What was with all the wide shots on the people killing themselves?  No close-ups?  At least make some sharp cuts to add intensity.  There was none of that.

This whole movie smelled like monotony.  The theme music had that same dreary, moaning oboe theme to it. Even the freaking synopsis on the back cover was bland. Nothing rambunctious like ""Edge of your seat thriller"".

Wahlberg and Deschanel did a horrible job.  Leguziamo did his best to salvage whatever he could of a scene.  Not their fault.  I've seen them all do much better.  Bad script.  Bad direction.

Trees and plants as silent killers?  Okay, maybe you didn't want vines and limbs to be grabbing at people because that would have been cliche, but at least make the trees imposing enough to want to cause people to kill themselves.  Add some foreboding lighting or a weird glow.  Trees and Plants are more eco-friendly than eco-foe.  I wasn't convinced at all.  Sad.

Shams, you're slipping.  What happened to all the movies with the surprise endings?  You strayed from your trademark.  That's what you're known far.  That's what we come to see.  We liked it when you surprised us. We understand that you don't have to do every movie that way, but  you seemed bored making this film.  Are you sure you're head is in the game?

I'm assuming that you're just in a slump right now, but let's your next film comes back to the standard.  We miss that."
451,5.0,"I remember as a kid in the 80's, the best cartoon show was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I like everything about this show. The newer cartoon that came in 2003, I didn't like it as much because it lacked what the original series had. I like the Turtle Van, the Technodrome, Krang, Shredder as a human and not some freaking krang-looking utrom. The new series can't beat the classic original series. You'll enjoy this Volume One DVD of the original series."
452,5.0,"Truly, I wasn't expecting much save for warm-up for the PPV before the legendary Wrestlemania XX, but this one on its own was spectacular when compared to the likes of Armageddon 2003 or Insurrextion 2003.  I've never been a fan of Smackdown, but this one really impressed me.

Individually, most of the matches were good, but there were some exceptions.

WWE Tag Team Championship Handicap Match
Rikishi and Scotty 2 Hotty vs The Basham Brothers and Shaniqua
All in all, this wasn't a great match, but somehow these five managed to make it a good one.  Shaniqua involved in the match was also interesting, as WWE treats its Women's division like it wasn't there, and she actually did some wrestling and got attacked by Rikishi.  (6/10)

Jamie Noble vs Nidia
Seeing Nidia in Tough Enough really makes it hard for us to get into this gimmick of hers without a proper suspension of disbelief, but still, this match wasn't so much a match.  Jamie Noble is blindfolded, and Nidia childishly kicks his butt from behind and taunts him.  The ending was dissatisfying, but at least it was over quickly.  (1/10)

A.P.A. vs World's Greatest Tag Team
Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin are great technical wrestlers, and Faarooq and Bradshaw are just brawlers.  The way these two teams worked with one another was really impressive.  (7/10)

Hardcore Holly vs Rhyno
Virtually nothing of this match was memorable.  I can't remember anything good about this match except that it was short.  This is the sort of forgettable match you don't want to see on a pay per view, like Goldust vs Rico at Insurrextion 2003.  (0/10)

WWE Cruiserweight Championship
Rey Mysterio vs Chavo Guerrero
I read some other reviews saying this was a great match.  I think Rey Mysterio in the WWE is like a bird with his wings clipped, if not cut off altogether.  You need only to watch some of his legendary matches in ECW or AAA or WCW, versus such people as Psicosis, Dean Malenko, and Eddie Guerrero to understand his immense talent.  With WWE's watered-down booking, he's literally like a bird without wings.  Chavo isn't very good on his own either, and in the middle of the match, I literally nodded off, almost fell asleep, and came to some time later without remembering what had happened before.  A boring match.  (3/10)

#1 Contender's Match
Kurt Angle vs John Cena vs The Big Show
John Cena is a joke.  Whoever on the writing staff decided this guy was worthy of WWE championship and holding it for months on end without losing should be fired, at the very least.  Kurt Angle is an amazing athlete, and he works well with the flat dud Cena.  Even The Big Show is impressive in his own right, and seeing Angle barely pull off Olympic Slams on him is a shocking sight.  Cena was a useless addition, in my opinion, as the stars of this match were clearly Angle and Big Show.  (8/10)

WWE Championship Match
Brock Lesnar vs Eddie Guerrero
This was the highlight of the night without a doubt.  Brock Lesnar I had always thought to be a big, dumb, blank-faced thug so thickly muscled that he could barely move.  Aside from the fact that I'm totally wrong about that, he and Eddie Guerrero put on a great match that lasted over half an hour.  At first I was worried (since I knew Guerrero would win) that Lesnar was dominating Guerrero too much early on in the match, but there was another 20 minutes to go, and Guerrero really played the underdog great, and did enough damage to Lesnar to justify a victory.  The only flaw in this was that Goldberg came out and gave Lesnar a spear, potentially cheapening the victory for Guerrero, but they went on for a while longer.  Best match I've seen between these two so far.  (10/10)

I have to add the Sunday Night Heat bonus match in the extras

Tajiri, Akio, and Sakoda vs Ultimo Dragon, Paul London, and Billy Kidman
A ten out of ten match.  I can't believe this one was regulated to Sunday Night Heat and not included into the pay per view.  I haven't seen this sort of teamwork between Tajiri and his gang than in any tag team since the Hardy Boyz.  It was also the first time I've seen a triple dropkick before.  Everyone here is a cruiserweight, technical wrestler or high flyer, and it works like freaking poetry.  (10/10)

Absolutely one of the best pay per views I've seen from WWE in a while (not including WWF events).  Solid performances all around, save for a few weak links."
453,5.0,"You know, I don't know why, but I love this movie. There are so many things in this movie that suck me in, that I just love watching this over and over again.

The depiction of Japan during the start of their industrialization.
The bad ass Samurai that charge into battle knowing the outcome.
The beautiful sound track that sucks you into the world and makes you want to visit this idyllic Japan.
The meeting of enemies who come to understand one another.
and the absolutely epic final battle that makes me cry every, freaking, time.

Some might complain that the movie is slow and that a lot doesn't happen. Yeah, I can see why they would say that. But honestly, there's a reason for it. Unlike most movies, this film gives you the opportunity to actually grow and care for the characters. It let's you be a foreigner in a strange land and shows you their culture, their way of life, their values.

It shows you that your enemies don't always necessarily have to be your enemies. Or that tradition is still very important in our culture, even though we so desperately want to modernize.

It's a powerful movie, and notice that I didn't mention Tom Cruise until now? That's because, although he was fine in the movie. I don't watch it to see him in action. Although he is important in numerous scenes, I don't particularly take much notice of him. He's just there to serve as MY avatar, so that I am interacting with these fascinating people. He's there, so that I can see what happens to the Japanese and their way of life.

Sorry, but Nathan Algren will never be as cool as Ujio, who reminded me of Mitsurugi from Soul Caliber.

If you have the time, definitely give this movie a watch. The final battle alone and it's amazing soundtrack is well worth the price of admission."
454,5.0,"I really wanted to get this when i first heard it was coming out this year, i got the first one and i practically watch it everyday. I actually haven't seen this season yet because I = no cartoon network; or any cable channels for that matter. So i was really hyped to see it. Until i started building a new computer, so i have all this money saved to get a new computer; and all this freaking awesome stuff is coming out this year. Woo me, well since it has been delayed for basically a month, i might actually have money by then. so yay! although if it did come out earlier i would have gotten a discount on it on employee appreciation day, :( oh well."
455,5.0,"It sucks that they only put a few episodes when they could put like all of them.  But it doesn't really matter I guess, they get my money either way because this is such a freaking funny show.  I can't wait to buy both this and Aqua Teen.  And Chainsaw Hands!"
456,5.0,"Ryan Murphy, the director and writer for Nip/Tuck, is a freaking genious!  He writes some of the most darkly disturbing satirical minutes of television around.  With Nip/Tuck, TV pushes it's bounderies by exposing the bloody surgions table as well as some much needed T&A...I love the fact that this show will go where ever it needs to go and expose whatever it needs to expose to be the most original show out there.  I have loved this show since the beginning and with season three already here (thank god) now I have something to watch on TV that's not reality based.  In season one we meet our doctors and their families (or lack there of) and we see the triangle forming between our surgions Sean (Walsh) and Christian (Julian) and Seans wife Julia (Joley).  Its a key part to the story, as is Christians fling with Kimber, a porn star and Gena, a woman he meets in S.A.A (sex-aholics) as well as Seans affair with a breast cancer patiant and Matt (Seans son) and his girlfriend troubles when his GF goes lesbian, and don't forget the gang violence and the threat of the deconstruction of Macnamara/Troy (their business) due to their fight for Julia's affection.  With patiants ranging from child malesting priests to mexican woman smuggling heroine into the states through breast implants...every episode is intreging and entertaining and is sure to make your mouth salivate for season two, and then once you've watched all that hopefully you'll keep up with season three which has proved to be everything hoped for!"
457,5.0,The extended version is freaking awesome! i gave away the regular version. so much is explained in the longer versions without the movie becoming tiresome.
458,5.0,"1) Make sure you invest in the Trilogy set. I'm glad I didn't invest in the other copies of this film

2)This has 15 freaking discs in it. 6 belong to the blu ray movies and the other 9 are all extra stuff. Yeah you read that right 9 discs worth of extra stuff.

3) Only the movies are Blu rays. The other  9 discs are all dvds.

It was a great investment and I would highly suggest getting it if you haven't already."
459,4.0,"Updated: As I said in my comments, I am a hypocrite and couldn't help but pre-order this set. However, 3 days b4 its release the price dropped 13 dollars and I'm thrilled. I've changed the rating to 4 stars. Still not a huge value, but a much better value, and I'm getting excited to fall in love with these films all over again.

Original:
I don't want or need 15 freaking discs. I just want the three extended edition movies on blu-ray. Rediculous. Too expensive. My favorite movies, btw."
460,1.0,"Not only are they trying to get you to pay 4 times.. but the quality of the Blu Ray release was done half *** like a typical no name catalog release.  Video Quality was given a 2.5 out of 5 on [...] review of the Blu Ray edition.  Warner needs to get their heads out of their *** and do quality releases instead of crap like this one.. This is one release they should of done a good job on.  Will they do a better quality release on the extended cuts? I Doubt it.. this is freaking Warner Brothers were talking about.. they could care less about quality.

The price of this should be cut in half to properly represent the effort Warner put into the release."
461,5.0,"I finally decided to watch this film after having watched the first 5-10 minutes of it repeatedly on cable. I never got a chance to finish the film, having always been called away or on the go somewhere. I just naturally assumed that this was going to be some dark & overly depressing art flick that I'd regret watching. I was completely wrong.

The film follows the character of Fin, a man with dwarfism who prefers to spend most of his time alone. He inherits a train depot in the middle of nowhere from his deceased boss, assuming that nobody will bother him & that he'll be able to enjoy his trains in peace. Once he gets there he discovers that a well-meaning snack truck operator parks his truck outside the train depot & is intent on befriending Fin. Fin also meets the clumsy artist Olivia, who is depressed over the loss of her son years before.

I just loved this movie. There's so much to look at in this film & there's so many different ways people could interpret actions made by it's characters. I just really can't say enough good things about this film. Both my mother & I were skeptical that we'd like it, but by the end of the film both of us were saying that we wanted to buy the DVD.

If you like action flicks or are looking for something with tons of romance, sex or intrigue, this isn't the film for you. This is very much a slice of life movie. There's no big message in the film, nor is there any touchy feely ""the more you know"". Finbar doesn't teach the town how to appreciate people with dwarfism, nor is there any point in the film where he has this big triumph over adversity. It's just a film about a group of people befriending each other.

I freaking love this movie. And now apparently, I freaking love Peter Dinklage."
462,4.0,"ONE of Craven's earlier chillers which I thought was pretty good. Mara Jensen and her husband live on a farm and her husband is accidentally killed. (not a spoiler it happens in the first ten minutes!) Her friends Sharon Stone and Susan Buckley(patty from grease) come to stay with her. Besides them, Mara's only other friends are Lois Nettleton and her shy daughter who live nearby. Soon more accidents are happening ,obviously a killer is on the loose! You get a snake in the tub(just try to watch!), Mara Jensen in two catfights, and sharon stone freaking out in a barn and falling down stairs. i don't know why this is so hard to find. they should re-release it. luckily i have a copy i bought used a few years back. if you can find it get it."
463,5.0,"...I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re-release of these three films on DVD. A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again.  Now I don't blame them.  I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor.  I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again.  Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score.

  In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they  make a great buy.  I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of ""The Fellowship of the Ring.""  I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again.  The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me.  They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better.  The only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc, you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie--which is really not a big deal.  I highly recommend getting these to those that don't own them yet."
464,5.0,"The first 2 seasons were great (and deserve their 5 stars), and they deserve to be followed up by the rest of the seasons.  Attention Sony, and any other idiot company with a stake in this series, who are dragging their collective feet on getting the rest of the seasons out the door: Get your stupid ridiculous legal garbage sorted out YESTERDAY and get the freaking season sets into production!  We the fans don't care about who owns the music rights, or which actors had a rider in their contracts for royalties on the sets, which you are now arguing about, or whatever else ridiculous garbage you idiots are bickering about.  JUST. GET. IT. DONE!

Don't tick off your fan base like Mad About You did to theirs by pulling this exact same stunt.  I can tell by the sales numbers of Mad About You DVD sets that screwing the fans for so long has hurt the long term sales of Mad About You on DVD.  This is how boycotts happen, you morons.  This is also what prompts idiot teenagers/pirates to put up bootlegs of the seasons burned from copies of the show, onto their own DVDs, and to sell them on e-bay, and upload them to the internet at large.  Please don't let the idiot teenagers/pirates win!  You are LITERALLY in a race against the pirates.  You HAVE to get to market as fast as you can, if you want to sway the mildly legally minded consumer who might be tempted to just download the shows (I am not one of them, but I know a lot of college people who are) and not wait YEARS for the DVDs to come out.

Do whatever you have to do to get the sets out.  If it is music rights, then either yank the music out and have ANY COLLEGE BAND IN AMERICA do a new music piece for anything that gets yanked (and they will do it for free -- just to get their band name in the credits!) or just pay whatever it takes for the music, and then add an extra $2-5 dollars onto the DVD price, and pass the cost onto the consumer.  We don't care!  We just want the sets.  If you are worried about low sales numbers, then do a pre-order, and only print like 105% of the disks that were ordered, and keep doing pre-orders for every re-printing.  Amazon and anyone else who takes pre-orders will LOVE you if you do that.

GET. THE. SEASONS. OUT. THE. DOOR!"
465,3.0,"This is a good movie the first time you see it, but after that there is no reason to watch it again.  Sean penn's performance although deserving of a nomination could have been better, i think johnny depp should have got it.  He shows emotion throughout, but in some scenes he lacks the right expressions to pull off the effect, the drama suffers becuase when he should be freaking out like in the scene when the cops are holding back(the best scene in the movie), he doesnt.  Tim robbins is good but also could have done better.  The story is average at best.  The ending is the biggest dissapointment and is very predictable, they should change it really.  The movie is an 8 out of a 10 the first time then goes down to a 3 the next."
466,5.0,"I've been a Friends fan since Day One, and man, what an amazing ten years. This DVD is a must-have for every fan. I remember the first time I saw Jennifer Aniston on TV, she was like 25 during the first season, and just like every guy in America, I fell in love with her and she made me melt like Velveeta. I had followed her career since then, but she will forever be Rachel. Speaking of Rachel, what a classic hairdo that was. I loved it! If this disc will have the pilot and music video, then it is a great value. By the way my favorite episode of all time is a season one episode, the one where Rachel has to return the ring and it got lost and she was freaking out, ""And now I'm going to have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder!"" This show is truly an all time classic and I'm glad to have been a devoted watcher for the last 10 years."
467,4.0,"I really enjoyed this movie. I found it by searching for ""war movies"" but it's barely a war movie. It really only takes place during a war. They do a good job of creeping you out throughout the movie, whether it's the insane soldier freaking out or the dark forces in the trench."
468,3.0,"I remember having a discussion with a friend, once, about people in high school and how there are three groups of them - (1) the ones you hate, (2) your friends, and then the third group: the people that you could live without, but you simply don't have the energy to actively dislike them...so you're nice to 'em. Watching Starsky and Hutch last night, I realized that those three groups totally apply to movies, also - filth like Welcome To Mooseport easily falls into that first category, masterful cinema like The Passion slides into the second one, and then...well...stuff like Starsky and Hutch goes right into that third category. Unlike director Todd Philips' earlier films, Road Trip and Old School, there's a sweet, harmless quality to Hutch that, even though I can't say I loved it, I enjoyed myself.
  The '70's cop show isn't so much parodied in the movie but used as a springboard to pair Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, who - with the right project (The Royal Tenenbaums) - can rock. It's kind of a Felix and Oscar cliche, but Stiller's Starsky is the fastidious, by-the-book cop and Wilson's Hutch just knows a little too much about cocaine. The movie predates the show, imagining how the two got together and then throwing them into various situations that sometimes score and other times fall completely flat. Snoop Dog's bit part as Huggy Bear just didn't do anything for me - usually, that '70's blaxploitation schtick is hilarious (i.e. Undercover Brother or anything on Chapelle's Show), but he fits in like an afterthought, the director trying to pull to another demographic. What does work, though, is a great scene where Starsky accidentally ingests cocaine and excitedly enters a disco contest. Or an undercover bit near the end of the film that you might have caught in the trailer (remember the horse in the garage?). I'll admit, I almost needed a catheter in certain scenes.
  Then again, S&H can just be kind of stagnant at times, desperately attempting to be funny and not succeeding. Stretches of the movie were laughless and restlessness sets in...BUT - as much as I want to dislike this movie, I just can't. At the end, when the movie could have committed the carnal sin of overkill, it ends before it wears out its welcome. Nothing in it is really offensive, tasteless, or awful, and that's a rarity in buddy comedies these days. Stiller is looking more and more like a star in every movie he does, too (the vomit-worthy Along Came Polly notwithstanding) - most of the comedy in the movie is thanks to his awesome talent for playing off of that faux-macho persona that works so well for him. And then Will Ferrell - ahh, Will. Where do I start? The man is a riot, and a cameo that he has may as well be the single funniest scene of the whole film (he gets the privelige of alluding to the homoerotic speculation that was rampant during Starsky's run in the '70's).
  When TV show rehashes are done correctly, they can be brilliant (look at the genius Brady Bunch parody), and when they're done wrong, they can be freaking awful (Leave it to Beaver), but Starsky and Hutch is really neither. It tows the line and makes it a worthwhile experience in the end, and an albeit hilarious one, at times. It's occasionally dumb, it has an interminably slow first act, and I can't say I'd watch it again. I can't say I didn't have fun the first time, either. GRADE: B-"
469,5.0,"This DVD is #5 on my 130 best WWE DVD's.  It was Survivor Series 18th PPV.  It was amazing pick it up.

Undertaker vs. Heidenreich was a match that every body thought was gonna suck.  It was freaking awesome.  Taker hits Heidenreich with a Chokeslam, Last Ride & a Tombstone Piledriver to win.

JBL vs. Booker T was a great match as well.  JBL's title reign has become a joke and he is gonna get what he deserves at Armageddon.  JBL retains and this match wasn't that bad.

Classic Survivor Series Match Team Orton vs. Team Triple H was a great main event that didn't disappoint anybody.  Orton is a great wrestler and he proves it when he eliminated Edge & Triple H on his own.

This DVD has a lot more in store so when it comes out in about 2 weeks pick this up."
470,1.0,"With a generic cover of JBL smiling and the No Mercy sign in a dollar bill, I should have seen disaster coming.  But like an idiot, I plunged into it anyway.  And I will make up for my regret by telling everyone just how awful it was.

Eddie Guerrero vs Luther Reigns
I swear, the match was secondary to the commentary.  The match was as dull as they come, with little more than cheap punches, kicks, and stomps, and the occasional headlock, but all you ever heard was from Michael Cole and Tazz ""OMG look at Luther Reigns!""  ""He used to be a mercenary"" ""He survived getting his throat cut""  ""He's a hardass OMG"".  It was a horrible match, ending with a fake hit with a police baton in memory of Ray Traylor, the Big Boss Man who died recently.  (0/10)

Spike Dudley vs Nunzio
Not only are these two cruiserweights, but they're both ECW originals.  The bookers in this time must not have known what to do with them, because they were reduced to mere brawlers with a few flying moves.  This one was hopelessly boring with a predictable ending.  (1/10)

Billy Kidman vs Paul London
Considering that these two are high flyers, I expected a cruiserweight high-flying bout of epic proportions in very un-WWE style.  Alas, I've been spoiled by ECW, ROH, even old WWF.  What I got instead was two high flyers acting like brawlers.  Except for the occasional high impact ATTEMPT and the Shooting Star Press, this was little more than a brawl, more suited for a Hardcore Holly vs John Cena match.

The storyline behind this one was awful as well.  After a legitimate botch of the Shooting Star Press, Billy Kidman injures Chavo Guerrero Jr., and what does the WWE do?  They turn Kidman into the heel because he's afraid of hurting people with the SSP again.  Inexplicably, he turns against Paul London, and is villainized because of his concern for others' well-being.  An angle that ranks down there with Katie Vick. (0/10)

WWE Tag Team Championship
Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio vs Kenzi Suzuki and Rene Dupree (C)
With RVD and Rey Mysterio in the match, I'd've thought this would be a good one.  Instead, in typical WWE style, their wings were cut, and Kenzo Suzuki showed just how limited his wrestling skills are.  Either that, or the WWE decided to bill him as a brawler.  The match was a dud when there shouldn't have been one.  I'm shocked Smackdown bookers could fumble this one so badly.  (3/10)

The Big Show vs Kurt Angle
This match had two parts, before Angle counted himself out and after Theodore Long restarted the match as a result.  Before, The Big Show was dominating Angle like Mark Henry dominates John Q. Rassler on an average episode of Smackdown.  Afterwards, Angle started fighting back, but why bother?  The match was over as soon as Angle was counted out---boring, dull, listless.  It's as if the bookers went on coffee break and just told Angle ""don't even bother fighting""  (0/10)

WWE United States Championship
John Cena vs Booker T (C)
Any match with Cena in it is almost guaranteed for failure.  Still, Booker T tried, and for that I give him credit.  Cena gave little for Booker to work with.  It was as if the bookers told them, ""Let Cena win, but make him look like he worked hard for it"" and Cena ignored that order.  (0/10)

Charlie Haas, Rico, and Miss Jackie vs The Dudley Boys and Dawn Marie
This one was not a wrestling match by any degree.  The Dudleys hardly did anything, while most of the match was Bubba freaking out by being kissed by Rico, and D-Von being afraid to headbutt Rico's crotch---with Rico waving him in.  Aside from this, Rico is an amazing athlete, with martial arts skills he wields in the ring, and Charlie Haas got to pull off some awesome wrestling moves before the match was pitifully over.  (6/10)

WWE Championship
John Bradshaw Layfield (C) vs The Undertaker
JBL is hardly a great wrestler, and The Undertaker looks amazing only when pitted against even semi-decent wrestlers.  This match had virtually no actual wrestling moves save for two chokeslams and a Tombstone Piledriver.  The rest was punches, kicks, stomps, and a top-rope shoulder block by Bradshaw.  This was an overly long, not very exciting match that had the decency to move much of the action out of the ring for our entertainment.  Considering that The Undertaker was dominating JBL for 90% of the matchup, it was a lousy main event, with an even lousier ending that just spared JBL from further bouts with the Undertaker, and started a new storyline with The Undertaker and Heidenreich.  (2/10)

The perfect example of how pitifully far the WWE has fallen since WCW died, this pay per view had everything the dumb mark (wrestling term) would want---punches, kicks, headlocks, stomps, and shoulderblocks galore!"
471,4.0,"Excellent movie with a lot of heart and humor. Kevin Smith can write some incredible stories. I was happy to see this movie very different from his other movies, yet still have the Kevin Smith feel to it. I went into this movie knowing that Jennifer Lopez dies during child birth, but was still really sad when it happened. Watching Affleck go from happy, to concerned, to confused, to freaking out was really cool. I think that's about the same way I would have acted except I would be busting out crying. I really don't know how I would act towards that kid either. I for one would probably act the way Ben was towards her. But then get over it and start being a father like I should. After it going to her being seven years old, it even got better. You see he's become a pretty good loving and responsible father. He doesnt care about dating or just even meeting women, cause he has Gerty in his life and that's the only woman he ever needs. But then comes along Liv Tyler, who plays a cute nerdy chick at the video rental store. She breaks through his shell and helps him, I think, begin to get over his wife. The movie had some very funny parts in it..such as the 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours' part.

As for the DVD, make sure you watch Kevin Smiths road trips. And the interview with Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck. Once again...when Ben and Kevin get in the same room together, prepare for laughter. Them too are really good friends and bash each other like friends do, and make the audience CRACK up laughing. Very funny stuff. VERY VERY funny. My roommates never seen a commentary or interview with those two, and he was laughing so hard.

Anyways...watch the movie.

I give this move a 4/5."
472,3.0,"I watched this movie when it came out in theaters and I hated it. Now, years later, I had the urge to watch it again.  I didn't absolutely hate it like I did years ago (which is only because it didn't make me hate Julia Stiles all over again due to an unhealthy love of Dexter) but I didn't end the movie feeling like I loved it or hated it, just indifferent to it.  A major point of contention I had with the movie in high school (when I last watched it) was my hatred of her dress for the coronation.  They spent all this time and had a huge designer that boasted that she could create anything (including Chanel and McQueen) and THAT is what they came up with? That hot mess of 5 different colors and.... well, after several years (most of which were spent with subscriptions to Vogue) I actually love that dress and it isn't as awful as I once imagine it was. It's not the mess that was Molly Ringwald's Pretty In Pink dress that I still hate to this day (In fact I have a hard time with that movie because of that dress... and the guy).
I now like - and more fully understand - Paige running away to retain some semblance of her own identity and her own goals and dreams.  She doesn't want to walk and bow behind her boyfriend just because he's rich or famous or beautiful or all three (I'm looking at you 'she-who-cannot-exist-without-a-man-Bella-Swan').
But the thing that always made me hate this movie is still there. Still so cheesy and ridiculous and awful... That freaking butterfly! I blocked it out, I must have, or else I wouldn't have let the urge to watch it overpower me in such a way.  Was he holding the butterfly the entire time? Do butterflies just come standard with engagement rings? Is there a royal butterfly trainer? It's such a ridiculous, albeit small part, of the movie that I just can't handle it.  I've never understood the romanticism of the butterfly (they're just a bug to me).  But there's no real significance to the butterfly, just that one scene where he presents the ring... and a bug.  And then it's in a jar in her room.  Didn't it fly off to freedom after being trapped in his sweaty hand for 20 minutes, probably praying to whatever deity butterflies pray to that he wouldn't crush it (never mind the fact that the oils from his hands would have ruined it's wings and it never would have flown again).  Was his creepy little man servant hanging out, just out of sight, with a butterfly net so she could have it as a pet? A weird little reminder that her fiance is truly the cheesiest man EVER?
I still don't like it, but I don't hate it anymore..."
473,5.0,these are really great movies and i have seen them a lot of times and i love watching them over and over again because adam sandler is freaking hilarious and if you are a huge adam sandler fan like me you cant go wrong with buying this because you got two great movies for one deal and thats awesome and if i were you i would go with the fullscreen version but thats just me
474,5.0,"The first movie is rather slow. But the second one is pretty freaking awesome, especially if you activate language Track 3!! Texarcana Lake Gamera is one of the funniest things I've ever seen/heard. More like ""What's Up, tigerlily?"" than Mystery science theater, they redubbed the entire movie except for the main female character in redneck voices and altered the script to hilarious effect while still following the general storyline. It's rare that something will make me laugh sitting watching it by myself but this one had me chuckling throughout. I could have done without about 50 of the ""Holy Crap!"" dubs that were WAY overused but some of the things were so clever that I forgive them this one excess. The General that sounded like George Bush was hilarious, the one who was dubbed with the voice of a 7 year old boy was insane and the radioman that just says ""Kyuh Kyuh Kyuh"" like Roscoe P. Coltrane from the ""Dukes of Hazzard"" was genius.  I have yet to watch the third film but I have no doubt the commentary by Gamera will be amusing. Unless it's just Gamera screaming through the whole movie in which case it will only be amusing for about 30 seconds. So if you like Wild Turkey, Bar B Que, Guns and your sister a little too much this is definitely the box set for you!"
475,2.0,"Ok first let me say I love Zombie/horror/gore movies, I just freaking love them.

So when I heard they where making a comedy about zombie movies I was like this is going to be great, and then the reviews started coming in and it sounded really good, the hype was high...so what happened? Did they all see a different movie then I did? Cause the movie I saw was your typical zombie movie with a TINY bit (and I mean tiny bit) of humor in it. That's it, nothing new, nothing original, nothing great. Below average at best.

I've seen the good zombie comedies, Dead Alive, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness...this one falls short of all of them by miles.

Where's the humor...I mean every now and then we have a scene that should be funny...but the humor never comes out, I don't understand it? Why are there so many good reviews for this bad movie?

Unless you are starved for a zombie flick don't pick this one up, don't make the same mistake I did."
476,5.0,"This movie is so freaking funny, I think it was a surprise hit in the theathers not many of them were showing it. Surprisingly it has a story line, it develops characters, you don't hate Shaun or his "" couch potato"" buddy of his, you'll even learn to love Phillips! This movie has it all gore, romance, humor, very dark humor, and good sci fi effects. I can't wait till it comes out and I'll be a proud owner come the 21st!!..Thank God for british humor!"
477,3.0,"I just saw this movie last nite, it was pretty good, but I felt It needed more bloody freaking scenes, more gore, it has a couple of CGI shots, but not enough for my taste, and in order to call this a romantic comedy, which its not then they needed it to make it more funny! In general is an ok flick, it has its moments, but this should not be called one of the best ones, no way. It could've been better. 3 out of 5 stars."
478,5.0,"This movie is just so freaking funny. Yeah, it's all message-y too, but Mandy Moore keeping it evil Jesus-style, Eva Amurri speaking in tongues, and the down-with-the-lingo pastor getting his Christ on, while not going too gangsta wid it, is why I've watched it like 6 times. It makes me wish I was a Jewish."
479,5.0,"Saved is so freaking hilarious, I was surprised at how much I liked it. The acting is top-notch by everyone, I can't even praise any one actor in particular because they're all great. The music is also great and definitely fits the mood. As a christian, I attended Campus Crusade for Christ in college, and this movie is dead-on when it comes to depicting evangelical christians who try to 'save' people by appealing to their secular, worldly side. Yet as satirical as this movie is, it never crosses the line and becomes offensive. More importantly, although there are a few times when the movie becomes too sweet, not everyone in the movie gets a happy ending, which makes Saved more realistic than one might expect."
480,5.0,"When a group of my friends asked me to sit down a watch the entire series of a show called Invader Zim in one sitting, my first reaction was...Invader who?  Yes, up until recently, I was one of the unfortunate few who had not seen this series.  Well, after sitting through all three volumes of the show my immediate reaction was...That's it?!  There's no more?!  I must have more Zim!  Ziiiiiiimmmmm!

First off, let me say that my review for this volume of the series will actually be for the entire series.  Also, because my friend had to take his DVD's back (sigh) I did not have time to go through all the special features and commentaries.  However, I chose this volume in particular because it contained my favourite episode (more on that later).  The basic premise of the show (for those that don't already know) is that a race of aliens called the Irkens are planning a conquest of the galaxy, codenamed: Impending Doom II.  The conquest is spearheaded by a group of Irkens called ""Invaders"", who are sent to various planets to lay the groundwork for invasion.  Zim (who screwed up Impending Doom I) is one such Invader.  However, to prevent his interference with Impending Doom II he is sent off to a planet at the edge of the galaxy (i.e. Earth), and is accompanied by a broken, and slightly insane robot named GIR.  On Earth, Zim attempts to discover our planet's weaknesses while trying to blend in with Earth society.  The only one who actually knows Zim is an alien is a boy at the school Zim attends named Dib, who seems to model himself around Fox Mulder from the X-Files.  Dib attempts to stop Zim's plan at every turn, while at the same type trying to convince everyone around him that Zim is an alien.

This show is just all around insane craziness.  Nearly every episode of this series is gut-splittingly hilarious.  I remember one episode early on in the series where Zim steals his classmates' organs in order to make himself appear more human to a school nurse, but in the end becomes incredibly fat from taking too many organs.  There is another episode where Zim tricks Dib into thinking he has become this all powerful hero.  So powerful in fact, that he destroys the Irken mothership, and when that ship crash landed onto Earth it created a huge sandstorm that threatened many civilians, but Dib just roundhouse kicks it away! It was freaking great!  Another episode had Dib's sister, Gaz, hunt down a boy who took the last of the new Game Slave 2 consoles, and tortures him by not letting him finish his game.  Moral of the story, don't piss Gaz off.

But, by far my personal favourite episode of this series would have to be the Christmas episode in volume 3.  This episode had Zim attempting to take over the world by disguising himself as Santa.  It also introduced Minimoose (""Yup, him with me the whole time!""), it had a great fight scene between Dib in a giant robot suit and a colossal, out of control Santa suit, and it has one of the greatest Christmas carols of all time.  You know what, since this is Christmas time right now, I'm going to buy this series, force all my friends and family to sit down and watch this Christmas episode, and make everyone sing, ""Bow down!  Bow down!  Before the power of Santa!""

Frankly, it's a crime that this show was pulled off the air.  I remember hearing my friends tell me that Nickelodeon put this show in a pretty crappy timeslot, and wrongly marketed the show towards young children.  It's a shame though, because given the proper treatment by TV execs, this show could have easily become the next Simpsons, Family Guy, or South Park.  If you are reading this review, chances are you have already seen the greatness of this series.  If you haven't, then you MUST check this show out!  Zim commands you!"
481,5.0,"i love this show so much. i have the first two volumes and they just make me want to watch them more and more and more and more. i can't get enough of gir's crazy rantings or everyone casting dib off into disbelief as if he is crazy. hopefully they will have johnen vasquez finally doing an interview or commentary or something because he seems to be awefully camera shy. i wish they would really concider putting this series on another more probable channel that will put it on a slot that will give it ratings instead of prime time on nickalodeon.

i can't wait to see the christmas special. horrible holiday cheer, sounds like my holidays. why did they decide that this show was good for nickalodeon anyway? are they retarded? no need to answer because the answer was in the question. down with spongebob and up with zim. boot them freaking rugrats and give us gir. screw the fairly odd parents and hand us over dib. YEEEAAAAHHH!!!!!

oh yeah and don't forget kids, keep an eye out for those elusive characters from the Squee and Johnny the Homicidal Maniac comics that made their way onto dvd. if you don't know what i am talking about, look at the teacher and those really dumb aliens who were quite tall from vol 2."
482,4.0,"Roger Corman is generally credited with introducing audiences to the biker-gang film genre with The Wild Angels (1966), but know that Joe Solomon was no slouch when it came to producing various `chopper operas' during the late 60's with such films as Hells Angels on Wheels (1967), Angels from Hell (1968), Wild Wheels (1969), and this film, Run, Angel, Run (1969).  Looking at the DVD case you might get the impression Angel is a woman, being pursued by primates on motorcycles (at least that's the one I got), but you'd be wrong (as I was)...no, the title refers to a man named Angel, played by veteran actor William Smith, in his very first biker film.  Who's William Smith?  If your familiar with B films, the name should be know to you, but for those who aren't, you may remember him from a film called Any Which Way You Can (1980), as the bare knuckle brawler who fought Clint Eastwood's character at the end of that film...he can also be seen in the classic film Conan the Barbarian (1982), as Conan's father...a small, but memorable, role.  Directed by Jack Starrett, who also appeared in front of the camera in a number of films (he played the curmudgeonly Gabby Johnson in Mel Brooks' 1974 classic Blazing Saddles), the film stars, along with Smith, Valerie Starrett (hey, she has the same last name as the director...that's because they were married, fool) in her only silver screen appearance.  Also appearing is Dan Kemp (Hell's Bloody Devils), Margaret Markov (Black Mama, White Mama), and Gene Shane (The Velvet Vampire).

As the film begins we see an expository montage detailing how Angel (Smith) sold out his former gang, led by Ron (Shane), by revealing their secret, inner workings and such to a magazine called `Like' for a price of $10,000, along with plastering Angel's mug on the cover.  As you can imagine, the gang is none to happy about this, and `fix' it with a crooked cop to get Angel busted so they can catch up to him and express their displeasure.  Before they get a chance to do this, Angel's girlfriend Laurie (Starrett), a cocktail waitress and part-time hooker, bails him out, acquiring the necessary funds by peddling...well, certainly not drinks (how many women would do this for their old man?  Not any I know)...anyway, once Laurie springs Angel, they hit the road to San Francisco to pick up his bread, but his former gang is in hot pursuit, and they literally jump a train (one of the better stunts in the film) and meet some rapscalious hobos (a word to the wise, if a hobo shares something with you, whether it be a piece of sausage or a swig from his hooch bottle, he expects something in return, like a tumble with your old lady).  They eventually have to hole up in an abandoned house (one with working water, gas, and electricity, by the way), and Angel gets a job with a nearby sheep rancher named Dan (Kemp) in the capacity of mechanic/sheep dipper (sheep dipping is the use of a liquid disinfectant to destroy parasites and to clean the wool, prior to shearing).  Things seem to be going pretty well for Angel and Laurie, that is until Dan's pretty, young daughter Meg (Markov) inadvertently informs the gang of Angel's whereabouts, and things get messy from here on as the gang not only wants sweet revenge on Angel (they are willing to accept the money in exchange for letting him off), but their long search has caused them to be without female companionship, and they have their eyes on Meg and Laurie...

I actually thought this was a pretty decent film as it featured more of an actual story than I expected (the film was extremely popular on the drive-in circuit at the time, mostly due to the appeal of the rugged and handsome Smith).  There is any number of exploitive elements throughout, but a lot of the film deals with the usually volatile relationship between a very impulsive Angel (who sure says the word `baby' a lot) and his damaged goods girlfriend Laurie.  This effectively slows down the film in the middle, but Smith and Starrett did well breathing life into their characters, keeping my interest, and manage to keep things from getting too hokey.  Given this is a movie about bikers, there's a good number of motorcycle ridin' montages featuring Tammy Wynette singing the theme song `Run, Angel, Run'.  One thing I thought was really weird, given the relationship between the director and the lead actress, was the scenes where Angel and Laurie are getting it on...how does a director film his wife in such a scene?  I'd be freaking...the scenes themselves were fine, but knowing the director is shooting his wife getting it on with another man just seems...wrong somehow...anyway, some things to watch out for...check out imbecilic Meg when she's hanging with a group of bikers in the woods...seriously, there's nave and then there's just dumb...oh yeah, check out the dirty, greasy, shaggy, slimy, middle-aged bikers frugging up a storm with the teenage girls at the local juke joint...it was enough to put me off my food for a few hours.  The final sequences were pretty cool, as Angel has a sort of showdown with his former gang, his only weapon being a garden implement of some kind...

The fullscreen print (1.33:1) looks fairly decent, but isn't without flaws.  The Dolby Digital mono audio doesn't fair as well, as it's very soft, so you'll have to crank the volume.  Special features include trailers for the film, along with one for the films Hells Angels 69, Hell High, Warlock Moon, and The Hollywood Strangler .  Also, there's an optional intro by none other than Joe Bob Briggs himself, along with a `comedy' commentary track which is worth the price alone as Briggs imparts an incredible amount of detail as well as humor throughout.  I would have given this release three stars, but the inclusion of this feature is enough for me to cough up an extra star.

483,5.0,"Season 2 isn't my favorite ELR season, but it is very solid and enjoyable all the way through.  It includes the two-part flashback showing Raymond and Debra's engagement and wedding and many excellent episodes, my favorites being ""Golf,"" ""Anniversary,"" ""Marie's Meatballs"" (with the infamous sabotage of the basil!), ""The Checkbook"" (with the hilarious ATM scene), ""The Ride-Along,"" ""Family Bed,"" ""Good Girls,"" and ""T-Ball.""  This season is definitely one of the best from one of the best sitcoms ever.

Disc 1:
""Ray's on TV""--Ray is invited on the Roy Firestone Show and his family is critical of how he pronounces words and scratches his microphone.
""Father Knows Least""--Ally is being a brat so Debra and Raymond go to a parenting class where they learn about active listening skills that Ray seems to master better than Debra.
""Brother""--Robert is depressed on the second anniversary of his divorce so he starts to get more attached to Raymond.  Highlight: when Ray reenacts a movie scene and says ""Hey mother...""
""Mozart""--Ally doesn't want to take piano lessons from her grandma, so Raymond tries to relearn the ""Theme from Love Story"" to encourage her to pursue music.
""Golf""--Raymond tricks Debra into letting him play golf and then has an anxiety attack due to the guilt.  The advice from his doctor is more golf to relieve his stress (Ray: ""Would I see a podiatrist or a proctologist to get a foot removed from my a**""). I like when Debra goes off, ""When do I get to have an episode!?""

Disc 2:
""Anniversary""--It's Frank and Marie's 40th anniversary and they make a startling comment about their marriage to Raymond.  I like the kid they chose to play a 10-year-old Robert in the flashback.  His mannerisms were perfect, he was even left-handed.
""Working Late Again""--Thanks to Ray's mother, Debra begins to think Raymond stays at work late to avoid being at home so she gets him to work at home and soon regrets that decision.  Pat O'Brien makes a guest appearance.
""The Children's Book""--Debra wants to write a children's book and Ray thinks he's helping by writing it himself.
""The Gift""--It's Frank's 65th birthday and Ray didn't think they were going to buy him presents.  He then has to think of something to compete with Robert's remote boat and decides on a tropical aquarium.  An emotional episode at the end.
""High School""--Raymond goes to his 20th high school reunion and Debra has a better time with his old classmates than he does.

Disc 3:
""The Letter""--After her Tupperware party is ruined by a certain meddling mother-in-law, Debra decides to write Marie a letter about how she makes her feel.  Raymond, of course, is against the idea.
""What I  Want For Christmas""--For Christmas, Raymond wants to get Debra in the mood for what he wants all year round.
""Civil War""--Ray hopes to bond with his father in a Civil War reenactment but, as a late enlistment, he's signed up with the other side.  Why Raymond getting out of a planned baby shower didn't cause a ""house divided against itself"" with Debra remains a mystery.
""Mia Famiglia""--For Ally's school project, Raymond tracks down his oldest living relative who visits them from Italy and thinks he's finally found a relative to be proud of.  While she brings the family together, she may not really be family.
""Marie's Meatballs""--Ray asks his mom to teach Debra how to make her meatballs and she sabotages the cooking lesson.  Debra goes off in this one, ""Who's the nutcase now!!!""

Disc 4:
""The Checkbook""--Debra complains about how difficult it is to do the finances and Raymond doesn't believe it so she makes him take over the bills and, whala,  their checks turn to rubber.  Unrealistic but very funny, especially the ATM scene.
""Ride-Along""--Robert doesn't think his wise-cracking brother appreciates what he does for a living so he has him accompany him and his partner Judy (she's funny) on patrol.  When Raymond sees a heroic act, he writes an article about his brother but the editors make it about Raymond.
""Family Bed""--Ray and Debra try to wean their daughter from having to sleep in their bed.  Of course, for Ray, this process involves his mother.
""Good Girls""--The truth is out that Marie likes Amy better than Debra because she has been a ""good girl"" before marriage.  We learn something funny about Robert's birth.
""T-Ball""--Deb and Ray take their kids to a T-ball game and Debra is criticized by the wimpy coach about the snacks she brought.  Not liking conflict, Ray initially does not stick up for his wife and tries to buy snacks on the sly.

Disc 5:
""Traffic School""--Robert's traffic school classes are dull so he introduces Traffic Cop Timmy which he uses to get out his frustrations on his family.  A little creepy.
""Six Feet Under""--Raymond finds out that he's shrunk to under six feet and begins worrying about getting old and not accomplishing his goals.
""The Garage Sale""--Raymond has a problem selling his kids' crib and baby clothes at a garage sale because he wants more children.
""The Wedding Part 1 & 2""--The best of the end of season flashback episodes.  This two-parter goes back ten years to when Ray first gets his columnist job and proposes to Debra.  Debra is so excited about the wedding, he wonders if that is the only reason she agreed to marry him.  At the wedding, Ray's behavior makes Debra wonder if he's ""freaking out"" or is drunk.  I like how there are no clichs in the wedding scene like the best man losing the rings or the organ playing the wedding march too long.  Ray's vows: ""I'm sorry I've been such a jerk.  I promise not to be one anymore, if you'll help me."""
484,5.0,"So as some of you awsome movie goers have known that the new trailer of Terminator Genisys has came out and it has revelead a major sopiler. I was one of guys to have seen the new trailer and my expactitions for the movie are totally met with skepticism. So since I got the first terminator movie, I figured I just make the review so that I may express thoughts on it and how it still hold up today.

This movie was freaking awsome. The action was great. It had story, compelling characters, and one cool preformance from our main man Arnold Schwarzenegger as the human killing machine: The Terminator.

It's great to see how James Cameron can make this movie with a low budget and genius vision to go with it. The decisions he makes working on the project are bold and brave like General Patton. That is why he is may favorite director.

The special effects in this movie is amazing. It is good to see how they can make good movie with more pratical effects and less CGI then what they had done in 1984. James Cameron is a geinus.

But overall, The Terminator is a great film to begin with. It hold its own back then and it still holds on today."
485,5.0,"I can say with confidence that I dislike Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor.  His movies were once really exciting and adrenaline-rushing to watch as a youngster, but nowadays I find them overbearingly cheesy, atrocious from a storyline point of view and somewhat predictably written too.  However... there's always that one exception.  The Terminator *is* that one exception.  The original Terminator (and in fact the entire series) appeals to be in a way where most Arnold movies completely go over my head.  For one thing I suppose I like the entire time travel plotline.  This movie is about a terminator machine from several years into the future sent to destroy a woman by the name Sarah Connor.  However, the character of Michael Biehn is from the future as well and is clearly sent to save Sarah from her termination.  Michael sure has his work cut out for him as far as convincing Sarah he's actually the good guy!  This makes a compelling storyline.

The one unusual thing that has stood out to me over the years about this movie is that Arnold plays a bad guy.  Back in the day this was considered an enormous deal and a total surprise to everyone.  Not the same friendly guy we eventually saw in Kindergarten Cop, that's for sure.  Now some aspects of this movie probably haven't dated particularly well such as the segments showing the chaos from the machines going around zapping everything in sight.  It's obvious the machines aren't really there (thank you todays technology for spoiling us!!) and watching them move around is comparable to watching a movie within a movie.  However there's always something to make up for these dated portions (in this case, the one man getting zapped by the walking hunk of destruction and being destroyed before our very eyes, which was reminiscent of a pillow exploding into a pile of feathers- pretty awesome).

People don't understand why I love the Terminator so much since I have a history of knocking these type of films.  It has to due with my love of science fiction when executed a certain way.  It can't be *too* far-fetched (though truthfully this movie is borderline in that regard) and the story has to unravel in a way that's not confusing.  The Terminator succeeds on both counts.  A very easy to follow storyline without any confusion or question marks at the end- just the way I like it.

When it comes down to it, I simply love the feeling of fear when Arnold is marching down the street wielding a couple guns in his destructive search for Sarah Connor, destroying everything in his path.  This is a *wonderful* way to enable my heart to pump with unbelievable nonstop excitement.  I have to laugh however, whenever Arnold imitates the voices of people Sarah's familiar with over the phone.  Seems... really fruity, lol.  By the way, the most frightening part comes when Arnold's machine rises from the fire and walks down the street near the end.  It's freaky because of the way the film is presented during this part.  While unintentional back in 1984 when this movie was released (because the film was undoubtedly considered ahead of its time from a cinematic point of view) nowadays it's just really strange viewing material.  While it's clearly obvious the machine isn't *really* walking down the street, I like the freakiness associated with the machines movements.  It's almost comparable to experiencing an actual nightmare.  It's hard to explain.  It's just really freaking freaky!

Overall, a highly recommended film.  Does it hold up well?  YES!  Does it hold up over the years?  YES!  The action -especially Arnold's blaze through the police station- was just unbelievably fun.  A young girl running for her life presents a ton of suspense.  This is how a good action/science fiction should be in my opinion."
486,5.0,1080p HDTV with my PS3 playing this movie is so freaking awesome!  Looking way better than the VHS and DVD with the standard TV.
487,4.0,"It's been nearly a month since I have finished this season finale and it has taken me so long to review this because I just didn't know what to say, I had to let it sink in, I mean, it's a season that REALLY gave me more mixed feelings than any of the previous seasons, and there was another season that took me a couple of week's to review due to mixed feelings and just needing to think about it, that's what the case was here, being a season finale I expected SO much more and wanted SO much more, and what I got what a WHOLE LOT less than what this could have been, not only that but I think it was the first disk that did not have a single bad episode, in fact, I believe I liked them all, however, somewhere after that there were a LOT of ok, mediocre, forgettable, and genuinely uninteresting and forgettable episode's, and then it picked back up, however, the episode Storyteller which is COMPLETELY dedicated to an unlikable character when given 99% of the screen time made this the SECOND WORST episode I have seen, even worse than Bad Beer, thankfully there were only three episodes I hated throughout all seven seasons, this negativity aside, there was a lot of really, really good episodes, but I felt so underwhelmed considering this should have been completely strong from beginning to end like seasons 1,2,3, and 6. but unfortunately it doesn't deliver like it should have. It is however a respectable finale, not perfect, but sufficient, a whole lot of surprises and we lose some great character's which is hard, just emotionally we have become so attached to these people and that's what they were like to me, people, not just some actor's playing a part, I was so incredibly invested in this show and while I was sad that this was the end, it really was perfect to end it sooner as apposed to later, I just wish that it was better, but for what we got, it was altogether worth it, and of coarse I highly recommend it, if you're a fan of the show like me, and if you've never seen this show, then after you read this go buy all freaking seven yourself and have a good time! This is a great show, but not perfect and at times rather dated, but it has truly held up better than it honestly should have and more than almost any show from the decades before and after. It truly is one of a kind and could NEVER be remade, rebooted, or reborn into anything better than it was and is.

My favorite episodes of season 7 are:

Selfless
Same Time, Same Place
First Date
Chosen
Sleeper
Lies My Parents Told Me
Empty Places
Dirty Girls
Conversations with Dead People

488,4.0,"Like Tetsuo: The Iron Man this film takes you into a really bizarre, neurotic, and insane world where all of the normal conventions of cinema have been thrown out. In other words, you are either going to love this film or you are going to completely hate it. Personally, I am stuck somewhere in between those two extremes. This is by no means a perfect movie, but I really enjoyed it for what it was... or rather whatever you may wish to call it. The imagery was very abstract and, even though it felt like a Tetsuo rip off at times, there were still some pretty creative ideas within this film. I also liked how the entire film was shot in color instead of black and white. I think that too many of these types of movies rely too heavily on the stark atmosphere of black and white instead of exploring the vivid colors and imagery that can be projected in color. I especially liked seeing the actors freaking out in public. That was quite an amusing site to behold. How modest the Japanese are! I wonder how Americans would react to that. They stared at times, but for the most part they kept to their own individual business. I wonder what other bizarre events they ignore. Overall, if you are expecting a conventional movie with a storyline and a cast of well developed and likable characters, then look elsewhere. If you want to see an LSD trip of a movie, then this is going to be right up your alley, because the images on screen are just very bizarre and abstract. I guess that you could read into this film in any way that you choose. Ultimately, as a piece of art it is left open to interpretation. However, you have to look at the images in order to understand what this film is trying to say. So, with that in mind, this is a film that is told through images, not dialogue."
489,1.0,"First of all, the sound was terrible.  The actors either whispered or shouted.  I think there was only one guy (Alberto? don't know what his function in Chopin's life was)who spoke normally.  I was either turning the sound way up or way down.

The subtitles are only in Spanish, which helped a little, but the language wasn't always accurate.

There wasn't much story there at all.  Chopin and Sand catch each other's eye in a courtyard, later she sees him play, and sends him a note.  Although she was speaking English, her accent made it impossible to understand her - she was one of the whisperers...except when she was shouting that Chopin drove her crazy with his refusal to answer her questions...anyway, I did not understand the attraction on either's part. They meet and immediately move out to the country, together with her children (they screech - sound DOWN). They get kicked out of one house, I forget why, and find another. Sand's son Maurice skulks around spying all the time, this gets on Chopin's nerves.  Sand wants everybody to get along, but it's like having three kids instead of two...Chopin does not see why her children need any attention from her and he resents them.  Maurice is sick with jealousy of Chopin, and Sand tries to soothe him.  Chopin appears to never have shown any interest in the children...so Sand is running between her children and him and trying to please everyone (for what?)...Chopin is diagnosed with TB, and the doctor tells Sand it is very contagious and to get her kids out of there.  She makes no comment...later daughter tells her suspicions that Chopin is consumptive and they shouldn't be around him...Sand ignores her.  Chopin doesn't start coughing (loudly - sound DOWN)until the very end of the movie.  Chopin and Sand have an argument and he tells her to get out.  End of scene.

Next scene ""Years Later"" we are told....how many years, or what transpired in those years, we are not told.  Chopin and Sand are living together with the kids...daughter Solange has grown and now considers herself in love with Chopin because he is a ""genius.""  Tries to seduce him, accuses Mom of hiring a maid to have sex with him because she no longer wants to...Sand just wants to be ""friends""...huh?  What happened to their great passion?  Chopin's stupid butler is loudly clanging pans together and laughing (sound DOWN) which drives Maurice crazy and I don't blame him...too much noise already in this freaking movie. Maurice says he has the authority to throw Chopin out....maybe this is Maurice's property?  We are not told.  There's lots of running through the field, running down the road (fast forward!) and much screeching with laughter (sound DOWN)for no apparent reason. Also lots of closeups on Chopin's face looking all gooey-eyed, remembering times with his family.

The messed up sound was an extra annoying punishment on top of a completely dull movie.  I cared about no one in this film, and I saw no motivation for Sand to to kowtow to the spoiled, whiny Chopin as she did.

I think the kids are the ones who desired love."
490,3.0,"Meryl Streep is the kind of actress who impresses you no matter what she does, be it mediocre (she was the lone bright spot of Stuck on You) or masterful (she was a powerhouse in Angels in America), so I was kind of scratching my head a bit when I realized that Streep, reprising Angela Landsbury's notorious role in this remake of the 1962 political paranoia thriller, doesn't have much screen time. That's right, folks, one of the greatest living actresses on the face of God's green earth comes on breathing fire and brimstone in a great scene in the beginning, pontificating and pointing that slender finger like a knife...and then she kinda disappears for a while, letting the revamped plot of Candidate take hold.

 And as a plot, it's a little iffy. In 1962, the villains and instigators of a high-level plot to control politics were the commies and Laurence Harvey's Raymond Shaw was merely a noted war hero. Demme and his screenwriting team have made ""Korea"" into ""Gulf War,"" ""Commies"" into a corporation called ""Manchurian Global,"" and (*scratching head*) Raymond Shaw into a possible Vice Presidential candidate (???). I know Demme and his writers were trying to transfer the movie's pertinence into an area we recognize today, but the contrivances of its plot ever-so-slightly feel just like what they are: a director desperately trying to turn a remake into as much of his own as possible.

 Demme is a talented director, though, and he does keep the early scenes of the film charged with a looming paranoid feel that did have me feeling the vibes of the original. And homeboy can do a great close-up, too; those camera-up-your-nose shots Demme favored in Silence of the Lambs are nearly as effective here, especially in a scene where a psychologically damaged Gulf War buddy (Jeffrey Wright) comes to inform Major Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) that he, too, has been having dreams that something else happened on a mysterious night overseas. These dreams that both have been having send the paranoid Marco on a quest to find out the real truth about Raymond Shaw (aptly played by Liev Schrieber), and that consumes most of the film.

 Problem is: it's not deliriously engrossing, like the original made it. Marco begins realizing he's right more and more, jumping through the loops of a prevalent conspiracy, and this just kind of goes on and on and on. As I said before, Meryl Streep's Eleanor Shaw disappears from the film, we never see anyone from Manchurian Global, and Kimberly Elise really botches her reprisal of the sultry Janet Leigh role (also changed, in its relation to the plot). Demme turns the movie on a kind of auto-pilot, fading out scenes in a hastily edited fashion, permitting Washington to stammer and yammer like he's posessed by Woody Allen, and even alters the emotional pull of the movie.

 I have no problem with a director trying to elicit emotion from his cast and building a scene fraught with it. But, in my opinion, characters in a political thriller should not cry. Case in point: a scene in which Marco and Shaw are together alone in a room. Shaw gives him more and more information about how he might be brainwashed, the ominous (and repetitive) score by Rachel Portman gets heavy in the back...and then Shaw elicits a single tear. WTF?

 But Liev Schrieber triumphs, despite that insipid little weeper of a moment. Denzel Washington, on the other hand, can't really escape the way the part has been written for him. In the (yes, I'm bringing it up again - that happens when you remake a classic) original film, Frank Sinatra's Bennett Marco was a strong man who was deeply disturbed by a dream he knew was right. Put in the present day, Washington's Marco never seems confident for one minute; in fact, he seems to be crushed by the very volition of the movie, and you should never crush Denzel Washington. Only if he decides to act like he did in Training Day.

 I think I know where they were going with the whole ""let's make Denzel a pussy"" deal. And that, friends, is this - botching the ending of The Manchurian Candidate like nobody's freaking business. If you've seen the original, you're likely to hang yourself with your underwear when you realize that Demme actually changes who does what in the film's climactic scene (I was ready to). More than that, though, I came to a realization that the grave misstep that the movie makes in that big scene, well, negates the entire purpose of The Manchurian Candidate in the first place. I want to run up to Jonathon Demme right now and scream, ""What in the hell were you thinking???"" It's that ridiculous.

 And it's kind of a shame. The Manchurian Candidate, had it stayed closer to both the plot and the emotional resonance of its predecessor, could have been a gripping yarn that succeeded on technical, narrative, and character levels. Demme's movie has altered all three, and he comes up a little short in each case, which is kind of a bummer for such a great cast (Meryl Freaking Streep!) and such haunting material. The movie has its moments (I sure liked seeing Bruno Ganz from Wings of Desire, but that's just me) since it's well-photographed and occasionally suspenseful, but in the end I still can't see any point in its existence. Denzel, Meryl, Liev, and Demme could have all made great, original contributions to film instead of this unneeded remake. All this movie does is reminds you how much of a masterpiece the original was. GRADE: C+"
491,3.0,"This episode is about as sterotypical as they come. B'Elanna acts the like typical over-emotional, bury-my-feelings, can't-be-satisfied-ever woman and Tom is the typical DUDE that does dude stuff while being insensitive to the woman's ""needs"". And Neelix reaches an all time low in my book when he acts like B'Elanna best girlfriend (you know the fat ugly one that never gets a date) as he proceeds to talk trash about Tom and how he should cater to her every whim like a castrated man slave.

Aside from the relationship turmoil a space race is also happening...I don't know how they did it...but they managed to make a freaking RACE IN SPACE WITH SPACESHIPS boring. I didn't think that was possible...

Well....the race suits looked cool at least, so props to wardrobe...."
492,3.0,"Yeah, talking over a song does suck but the thing that really turns a 5 star performance into a 3 star video is that constant cutting from the stage to the fans back and forth.  Maybe the band thinks its a tribute to the fans to put some of them on their DVD.  More likely is that video directors and editors cut to fans having a good time in order to remind dvd viewers that you too are ""partying with the band.""  I believe I can safely say that fans don't buy DVDs to look at fans.  We want to see the freaking band!"
493,2.0,"Ok first let me say I love Zombie/horror/gore movies, I just freaking love them.

So when I heard they where making a comedy about zombie movies I was like this is going to be great, and then the reviews started coming in and it sounded really good, the hype was high...so what happened? Did they all see a different movie then I did? Cause the movie I saw was your typical zombie movie with a TINY bit (and I mean tiny bit) of humor in it. That's it, nothing new, nothing original, nothing great. Below average at best.

I've seen the good zombie comedies, Dead Alive, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness...this one falls short of all of them by miles.

Where's the humor...I mean every now and then we have a scene that should be funny...but the humor never comes out, I don't understand it? Why are there so many good reviews for this bad movie?

Unless you are starved for a zombie flick don't pick this one up, don't make the same mistake I did."
494,5.0,"This movie is so freaking funny, I think it was a surprise hit in the theathers not many of them were showing it. Surprisingly it has a story line, it develops characters, you don't hate Shaun or his "" couch potato"" buddy of his, you'll even learn to love Phillips! This movie has it all gore, romance, humor, very dark humor, and good sci fi effects. I can't wait till it comes out and I'll be a proud owner come the 21st!!..Thank God for british humor!"
495,3.0,"I just saw this movie last nite, it was pretty good, but I felt It needed more bloody freaking scenes, more gore, it has a couple of CGI shots, but not enough for my taste, and in order to call this a romantic comedy, which its not then they needed it to make it more funny! In general is an ok flick, it has its moments, but this should not be called one of the best ones, no way. It could've been better. 3 out of 5 stars."
496,3.0,"I give this 3.5 stars. I'm stuck somewhere in the middle because after finishing it I liked it. It was cute. But I didn't give it 4 stars because I started watching it and it turned me off so much that I stopped the dvd. Then it came on BET Sunday and I was kinda flipping back & forth and catching bits that I hadn't seen. And ended up putting the dvd back in so I could finish it. The Epiphany character got on my nerves sooooo freaking bad & that's mainly the reason why I stopped the dvd the first time.

Monique is dating committment-phobe Anthony. I didn't agree with some of his views but she had been letting him milk her for 4 1/2 years so why should he pay for the milk after all that time. She did teach him a few things about treating a woman right but I didn't look too highly upon her because she was yet another sister with good talk but had ""stupid woman disease"" in her actions. Epiphany didn't see what a good thing she had with Reggie. He should've dropped her anyway. She had too much baggage and attitude and he didn't need it. Renzo was over-the-top which was either funny or annoying depending on the scene."
497,1.0,"I had a lot of expectations about this movie after bumping into the dvd in a store and reading the plot. I guess I was expecting something like, well, P.S. I Love You with Hillary Swank but anyway, I didn't let those feelings ruin the screening of the movie.
I was waiting and waiting and waiting....and waiting for SOMETHING in this movie to happen, but it never did. It is UNbelievably boring, and it seems like nothing ever happens in it.
Someone described in the reviews here that the story is a feel-good one, about something too good to be true. Well you know what? Nobody in this movie made me feel like this was that kind of story. Laura Linney is a very good actress, and so Topher Grace, but they didn't conveny any emotion at all. There is not even a really subtle reaction to the discovery that this guy is her long-dead ex boyfriend. You'd think that would warrant a facial reaction that moves you, tears, something. Not even Marcia Gay Harden's character seems to show any of these reactions. I mean, what the heck happens in this movie? Laura Linney finds a guy who is a freaking copy of her dead high school boyfriend, not only looks-wise, but also his behaviour and everything else. She begins dating him (having sex mere hours after meeting him). You would think that would make you show some emotion if it happened to you, right? Well not in this movie. It's like we're in some parallel universe were emotions are so pass, kinda like Beneath The Planet Of The Apes where talking is so rudimental that people communicate telepathically.
Not only didn't I feel engaged at all in this movie (except in the intro where Laura Linney is applying make-up: kinda says it all lol), I was so bored I almost fell asleep.
I can understand this MAY not be the big movie where every sentiment has to be scored by John Williams, but come on! At least show some reaction.
Bah, well, don't expect anything out of this movie, maybe you'll like it better than I have, I paid full price for this movie and I regret it.
The characters in this movie go through life as if they were mannequins.
It's like they are dead inside, like this movie."
498,5.0,"I had the opportunity to see Andre live for the very first time back in the mid 1970's, long before his career in the WWF.  I met him live at a show prior to his wrestling that evening.  I remember him showing us kids his ring which would easily fit on three of our fingers with room to spare.  Andre was a true legend and really the first true international star in Wrestling who toured the entire would and drew huge crowds.  This tape is a re-release of the old Colisseum videos from back in the 1980's and includes a mixed bag of Andre's matches.

We see Andre in squash matches against people like Moondog Rex, Black Gordman & Great Goliath, and a 3 on 1 match against Johnny Rodz, Jack Evans and Butcher Nova.  That throwaway stuff aside, we also see Andre winning an 18 man battle royal with Andre finishing off Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch for the win.

Then Andre Teams with Jimmy Snuka vs. the Wild Samoans.

Then there is the infamous hair-cutting match as Andre teamed with S.D. ""Special Delivery"" Jones against Big John Studd and Ken Patera.  As Jones was beaten up and lying outside the ring, the two villians teamed up on Andre and cut off his long hair.  If you look close...you will see Hillbilly Jim in the audience who would later save Hulk Hogan from a similar fate just a few weeks later.

Andre Vs. ken Patera - This was the revenge match as Andre got even for the Hair cut by destroying Patera.

Finally there is the famous body slam match from Wrestlemania 1 with Andre challenging Big John Studd.  Included are various segments with Andre appearing on the old Tuesday Night Titans talk show.  God that show was freaking hilarious.  It's really fascinating to see how far the WWF has come in 20 years in terms of their production values.  The productions are so much clearer and professionally done.

The only downside to the DVD is putting up with the host Lord Alfred Hayes.  If you think Michael Cole is annoying, just wait until you see Hayes.  Uggh..

I saw many of these matches happen at the time and I'm glad the WWE is putting these old tapes out on DVD."
499,3.0,"This is not a perfect Christmas movie by any means PERIOD.

The pros: The snow and all the christmas stuff and atmosphere is cute charming and puts you in the holiday spirit.

The main characters sudden change at the end was too convenient and the sad story at the end thats meant to touch us seems forced and just thrown up there to tie all the loose ends of the film.

Granted yes when I originally watched it it made me tear up because I thought it was sweet. My father died in July and this was one of his favorite Christmas movies so I will probably tear up again at that part just because... I miss him and know he enjoyed this movie.

The humor and slapstick in the movie was so so it was extremely forced and strained and unfortunately this was easy to spot which ruined the so called comedy of the movie immediately.

I felt like I was forcing myself to even chuckle during this movie when I first saw it on Dvd back in 2005 .

The acting from almost everyone involved is horrible Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis were not that bad but they seemed to be zombies just reading their lines through half the movie. Jamie Lee Curtis characters screaming also got extremely annoying irritating and aggravating after a while talk about OVERACTING to the point of no return.

Tim Allens character as usual like in most of his movies tries way too hard to be funny and its not convincing or interesting for the most part unfortunately.

The supporting characters an annoying whiny kid 2 idiotic cops who add nothing to the movie whatsoever a daughter who changes her mind at the last minute and decides to come home for Christmas with her good looking boyfriend. 2 friends of Jamie Lee Curtises you only see 2 freaking times throughout the movie neighbors that are so grating you'd want to punch them all out and a MAYOR with the most annoying monotone voice ever heard and as intimidating as a pussy cat would be.

The only neighbors that are nowhere near as annoying are the kindly elderly woman and her husband dealing with health issues .They were pretty much the only REAL characters worth sympathizing or caring about period.

Oh I forgot a ridiculous part of the movie revolves around a petty robber that adds nothing to the movie whatsoever AGAIN and a MYSTERIOUS stranger who offers the main character an umbrella at the beginning of the movie. With this being a Christmas movie and all I am sure people can guess who he turns out to be in the end. I loved the snow the christmas decorations but the story itself was ridiculous and the lengths these insane neighbors go to is extremely stupid and not even the least bit believeable either."
500,5.0,I freaking love this show!
501,4.0,"As a huge Olivia fan, I was thrilled to find this available on DVD.  My VHS copy never survived.  As the disk menu started up, I heard great sound and saw great picture quality.  But when I hit play, no more sound.  I was freaking out.  Couldn't imagine why the sound worked so well for the menu and speacial feature, but not the actual convert.

Then, I changed the audio in te set-up page to DOLBY 5.1 instead of DTS sound, and like magic, it worked fine.  However, That's where the accustic sound is slightly dated and not as crisp as we might be use to. Oh, how I wish the DTS sound was working.

Picture is fine and acceptable, sound is ok.  overall, I'm still very happy to have this in my collection, it is a rare find and worth the price I paid.

For those who think the dvd left out the original opening, it's located in the special featues. It's the montage of photos with an overture of her music.

Compair THIS concert from 1982 to her new concert dvd, the Live from Sydney Australia, and it's great to see how she has changed, but never lost her style of high class.  She is one INCREDIBLE performer."
502,2.0,"This isn't a review on the actual volume... I will say that the episodes are the next set of filler ones, which people who have first watched English DBZ should remember them as episodes 6-7 of the original dub, plus the first half of the full version of episode 8.  Notably Goku does some extra running, we get to see Kuririn contact Tenshinhan and Chaozu about going to Kami's, and Lunch gets to make a brief appearance.

However, FUNimation is still releasing the volumes with 3 episodes only on each disk.  This wouldn't be so bad if they had been releasing 2 volumes like they did in June, but with volume 4 DBZ uncut has gone back to only one volume, which means a petty 3 episodes every 2 freaking months.  Meanwhile, on TV, Cartoon Network has just started the Frieza saga.  Great, and we haven't even gotten to Goku's training on Kaio's planet, let alone the arrival of Vegeta and Nappa on Earth, and from the looks of it we probably won't be seeing those episodes until some time early next YEAR.  Sorry, but with a pathetic release schedule like that I really have to lower my score severely.  FUNimation can do better than this."
503,2.0,"I remember hearing that Season 3 lost ratings halfway due to a mixing of plotlines that seemed a desparate ploy by the writers to continue the plot. For Season 3 it worked alright in the end but Season 4 is a bit of a mess. It is much like the war in Iraq. The beginning is very well planned and faithfully executed and then everything goes to pieces. Up until the release of James Heller and Audrey everything goes well. And then the writers start grasping for straws. The real time formula has long since been abandoned, the most comic example being when Chloe is called back to work. She gets dressed and over there, checked in the building, reinstated and back to work in something like 3-5 real time minutes. I hope she lived close. And also, I don't know about you but if terrorists kidnapped the Secretary of Defense and planned to execute him AND his daughter live on the internet, shot down Air Force One, caused a freaking nuclear reactor to go off and then planned to fire a nuclear missile at some place in the States my confidence in the country would never be restored no matter how many tortures of possible ASSOCIATES (not actual terrorists mind) of terrorists the government brought about. Season 4 is, for me, more of a dystopian near future than a reassuring notch on the belt in the fight against terrorism. Who keeps an EMP in their office building, honestly."
504,5.0,"Like I said in the title I think all the bad reviews for this movie are ridiculous! I just wanted to go through all the bad ones and be like you are stupid, stupid, STUPID!! I think they are just seeing the subject knowing its gonna show you something completely different than what you want to think. You not wanting to deal with it and to not feel something for this man cuz of this subject.. It's a touchy subject that is like Taboo that no one likes to talk about but it should be something to be talked about and to understand much better. Definitely not for a movie for a person that don't like to watch anything that is a touchy subject let alone see it in a different way.

He played a role that I think most people wouldn't be able to pull off. I can't think of a person right now that could.

Through the movie he talks about wanting to be normal and to not have those feelings. It seems like he obviously dislikes himself for doing what he did. He is scared to be around other people or getting people close because of knowing what he did and if they are younger girls that he would try to do something with them. and I think its not cuz he would be afraid to end up back in prison because he really doesn't want to hurt them. He seems to know that what he did was wrong but he did it.  I don't know I felt for this guy! I felt like he really wanted to get over this and not to be that person anymore. It gave you a perspective that maybe just maybe that not every person that does a wrongful act are really bad people, just people that have something...in their mind chemistry or whatever that you get the end result.

I liked when they showed another pedophile, when his girl revealed she was abused by her brothers, when he finds out that the girl he was (idk what the word is) when her own dad was molesting her....The girl knew what Kevin Bacons character wanted just because of her dad and when she gave him a hug, idk to me it was like a sense of forgiving to who he was or something...I thought it was so great of Vicki to stick up for this guy who she really likes, I believe if there was no one there for him, he would have ended up back in prison. I wanted to punch Mary-Kay (Eve) for broadcasting it in the workplace, only because he wasn't into her. Really?!?! Jealous much? Sorry hunny not every guy that you are into, is into you, don't mean you should look him up and broadcast his life out like how she did. it showed the perpetrator and the victim, showed feelings, showed stereotypes in this movie

I am against child abuse whether its emotional to the physical or sexually physical but to me this movie showed more than just that and it gave me a perspective of maybe finding out more about the person, to understand.."
505,5.0,"I just watched the set, and still find myself enjoying the show as I did when I was a kid. Muttley is so freaking funny, and that laugh... I am still puzzled why the show didn't last long."
506,5.0,"I've been a fan of these guys for over 20 years now, and they've seldom let me down. ""Family Jewels"" is a great collection. Others may complain about the studio tracks on some of the ""videos"", but I don't have an issue with any of that. I never got to see Bon Scott perform live when I was younger, so it was great to just see the old video footage of him kickin' it -- damn he was good!

The only complaint I have is ""Highway to Hell"" is poorly mastered...it seems to flutter during the chorus outros, but since I already have a collection of their songs, I didn't find this too terribly disappointing. You simply can't beat seeing these guys perform. No matter how commercial their sound was, they've always remained true to their roots and what motivated them to start playing, and you've got to respect them for that. AC/DC is the freaking best band on the planet hands down--they're my Rolling Stones...and ""Family Jewels"" is a great hold-over for those of us who need something between studio albums."
507,3.0,Meh?  Snipes is solid as Blade by Alba and Reynolds are freaking flat.
508,3.0,"3 1/2 Stars = Very Good

Here is where the ""Blade"" series hit a low, but then again, the first one was very good, though not great. It was not even in the same blood type as ""Blade II,"" which was just freaking awesome!

The third film is worth the watch, I mean, any film with Blade meeting Dracula has to have some redeeming qualities, right?

Bela Lugosi may be rolling over in his coffin, & Christopher Lee may take a hammer & stake to this film, but still,"" Blade: Trinity"" is very entertaining!"
509,5.0,"I love this movie -- one of the terrific supernatural 70's thrillers. Gritty, realistic, good music, and it gets the adrenaline pumping quite a bit!  The cast rocks -- Peter Fonda, Warren Oates, Loretta Swit and Lara Parker.  If what happened to these people, happened to me.. I'd be freaking out.  Like Deliverance, it's go out to the country for a trip... bad things happen.
Lara's character is interesting because she seems to have a sixth sense in that she senses bad vibes.

SPOILER ALERT --
The ending is terrifying.. especially when there is no noise, just hearing the wind blow."
510,4.0,"Bout freaking-A-time! I have been waiting for this dvd FOREVER!!! On my birthday on July 29, I happen to be in a dvd store and I see a different Peter Fonda DVD on a shelf which makes me ask the question I always ask and yet know the answer; ""I was wondering if you have a release date for Race With The Devil?"" Not only does the guy have an answer but he says it shows we have 6 in stock! I was like... no way. It HAS to be a different movie. Has to be. Sure enough we walk over to the shelf and there it is; RWTD. I'm totally freaked. Totally. Not only that but it has extras!!

I really didn't care about the cover art as I stood there in the store though now reflecting on it it seems a shame that Warren didn't make the pic. Beyond that it's a fairly awful Photoshop chop job, even the font is not what it should be; I much preffered the racing stripes.

Looking beyond all that, and having viewed the extras I still say, for the price it was great, let alone the fact I would I have paid ANY PRICE. I had to import ""Magic"" from Korea, I'm still looking for ""The Stepfather"", ""Race With the Devil"" was just another one of those movies I love I could never find, ""Sybil"" being another. Where are these? Anyway, the Peter Fonda interview isn't that great but the commentary is quite revealing and quite awesome:)

I'm surprised that according to all involved the movie did as well as it did. Most people I know have never heard of this. Plus the action is kinda ""Sunday Afternoon TV"" but what I always loved about this movie was the chemistry between Warren and Peter, and wouldn't you know it (though I never knew it) they had made two other movies before this. I knew the chemistry was just right and turns out there was a reason.

Odd too how Warren was ""Frank"" giving Loretta many lines where she said the name ""Frank"" which always conjuers up old terrible himself Frank Burns.

I love just about everything about this movie, though the bike sequences tend to make the movie drag in parts, I love all the bit characters from Sherriff Taylor, to the couple in the RV park, to all the gas station guys, everyone just seemed suspiscious without really doing much to provoke it.

Lastly, the ending. I have always loved this and while it did leave it open for a two parter, what it really did was leave this movie open to your imagination as to what would happen next. I say they were able to start the RV and get away, but how much farther could they run? How wide spread was this cult? Those and many more questions should really be answered in the form of a novel. Because to try and recast this to extend the story now would be a train wreck inside of an RV; alas you can never recast Warren, Peter, Loretta, and Lara, they made this movie what it was.

NOTE: Dear Hollywood, please DO NOT try and remake this movie. It is quite clear you no longer have any ideas we all want to see, but we all have our memories so please do not tarnish them with your awful remakes."
511,5.0,"I'm a batman fan! the design, the toys, the way it was made is pretty cool, if it wasn't for the joker, penguim, and the other villains escaping all the freaking time from Arkham. I mean, what's up with that place ? can't hold nobody in for more than 2 episodes. hahah"
512,1.0,"I'm a little ticked off right now- this movie is flat out *awful*.  83 minutes of complete boredom.  I want my time back!

The movie relies on several cheap jump scares, but these segments are executed in the most unimaginative way ever.  The music and sound effects just suddenly turn LOUD without there actually being anything scary occurring on screen.  It's an incredibly easy trick to try and scare viewers by having them first experience several seconds of complete silence, then a loud noise to trigger a frightened reaction.  A terrible trick to try and make a movie scary if there ever was one.  Didn't fool me, thankfully.

I can only recall two scenes that truly frightened me. One is when the main character of Barry Watson stumbles into a room where a little girl is sleeping and she's so frantic Barry can't calm her down.  Meanwhile the girl is looking at the ceiling the whole time she's freaking out.  Barry turns around and sees someone has been in the room as evident by the one out of place ceiling tile.

The other quality segment is near the end when FINALLY the boogeyman makes his first appearance, and a man with a nail gun appears and shoots at what Barry initially thinks is him, but then Barry turns around and sees the boogeyman charging out of the darkness behind him, which is who the nail gun shooter is aiming for.  A rare moment of actual suspense.

Barry Watson is a pretty good actor, but he was given a terrible script to work with.  The entire pacing and storyline feels similar to watching an episode of Ghost Whisperer or Beverly Hills 90210.  You know, not *real* suspense- more like suspense intended for the easily frightened types.  That's what this movie is.  It's horrendous.

Also, the appeal of the boogeyman is supposed to be centered around children being afraid to fall asleep for fear the boogeyman's hiding in the closet but... this movie abandons that all-important aspect and instead focuses on Barry Watson's character walking around through dark homes and playgrounds meeting a little girl on two occasions, and a girl he likes (Emily Deschanel's character, who's also out of place- stick with Bones, Emily).

No fear, lots of boredom, a complete waste of my time, and I'm angry."
513,5.0,Some of you who are freaking out over Amazon's date that is set for 2010 are idiots. That is just a filler date because they had to put something up because no date has been finalized. From what I have heard this is going to be one of the best Disney DVD's ever. I pre-ordered this DVD back in June and I still can't wait. So some of you need to stop crying and wait patiently.
514,2.0,"So I bought this movie on dvd... it's one of my most prized posessions. Not because it's any good...but because it's so freaking bad. I mean, I cannot even watch it without being pissed. This dude is no pirate. He dances like a girl. I mean, some guys can make dancing look masculine, but this dude... he just looks like a pansy. See, I got it at walmart for $1. I would never pay full price. Also, the title is totally deceptive... this doesn't even have pirates in it... maybe in the begining, but they're big and fat, which are the dumbest kinds of pirates. In fact, I wouldn't even call them pirates... i'd call them ninjas-trying-to-be-cool. Oh, but it does have indians... and mexicans. I mean, if you're some sort of a softy pc looser... then you're gonna be all offended and think it's racist because all the mexicans act dumb. Sorry, there's not much I can say. It does have the Wizard of Oz in it, though. Which is weird. I mean, I can't figure out who the heck he's supposed to be... is he white? Is he mexican? His daughter is mexican... so was her mom mexican? Is she a half and half... a mutt? She looks like cathren zetta-jones too. So if you have a thing for cathren zetta-jones, add this to your library.... sicko. Anyway, I wouldn't buy this unless it was for a dollar... or less. Oh, but if you do like Aphex Twin... then buy it."
515,2.0,"The era was different and I have to admit the movie probably was actually somewhat neat back then. Be prepared girls are scantly dressed and so are some of the men. The acting is pretty awful, this movie was just not really that great. Ferrigno definitely gives Arnold a run for his money though, Ferrigno was in his prime when they shot this and he is freaking ripped as hell."
516,5.0,"So I just finished doing this dvd this morning.  I always like to remind readers that I'm a total belly dance beginner and I prefer latin/afro dance to middle eastern dance.  That being said I enjoyed the dvd somewhat. As the previous reviewer said the dvd starts with a warm-up/moving meditation that lasts about 32 minutes.  It is a very energetic standing warm-up with spinal, hip and leg moves to get the blood flowing.  I really, really liked the warm-up, even though I really disliked the warm-up music.  The meditation consists of seated sufi grinds ala kundalini yoga which moves from the hips to the upper body with arms.  Very nice.  This is done clockwise and counter clockwise.  She ends with legs stretches and hip pushes.

The combination is broken into sections.  Each section is first performed by the entire class and then by Sera and 3 dancers.  A word about the dancers.  I appreciate that Sera chose students with different body types.  Some were reed thin and some had bellies, like me :).  Very nice to see rubenesque women in bikini tops doing graceful bellydance moves.

I disagree with the previous viewer who said that Sera didn't breakdown the movements with the exception of the arms.  I think that she did a very good job of breaking down the movements and easing you into the actual bellydance movement by teaching what I call lead-in movements.  Hard to explain, but if you have taken dance classes before, you understand what I mean.  Teachers do this to keep students from freaking out by introducing a movement everyone can do and then adding layers until you're doing the actual complicated move.

She uses this technique in all of the sections.  At the end of the section, she and the 3 dancers do the combination with no instruction.  After all of the combination sections, the entire class does the complete combination from start to finish 3 times.  This is where they lost me.  I couldn't get the intricacies of the dance and found myself floundering and frustrated.  I think she should have called out the movements for the 1st round and then proceeded to the music only combination.

I have to say a word about the music.  I hated it.  It was techno, middle eastern something or the other.  Whatever it was, I found it hard to dance to.  What a shame because otherwise this is a very good dvd.  I would not call it a workout. i barely sweated.  It is rather an instructional  companion to your belly dance classes.  Since I don't take belly dance classe as there are none in my area of upstate NY, I will just use the warm-up section for my other dance dvds. If you are new to belly dance, start here.  All in all I did appreciate learning that bellydance has a movement vocabulary of its own...right down to the wrist twirls!  Who knew? I stand amazed."
517,4.0,"Have you ever wanted to see a low budget Irish zombie cow movie?  Yeah, me too.  For years now I've waited and finally, we get our wish with 'Dead Meat'.

The story goes like this:  a couple is driving down some Irish backroad.  He's an annoying hippie with a stupid hippie beard and she's just whiney and annoying with a stupid hippie beret.  Of course, they're high on some fine Irish ganja and start making out while driving.  While these hippies are making their dirty love, their car nails a pedestrian.  The male hippie exits the car and proceeds to have his neck chewed apart by the pedestrian who just so happens to be a zombie.  The male hippie then does something very much against his tree-hugging hippie nature:  he goes and gets his Club(not a wooden stick but the red metal thing that hippies put on their steering wheels)and proceeds to utterly smash the living crap out of the zombie's head.  Then the male hippie turns all zombie and goes after his girl.  She runs to a nearby house and eventually kills him, very inventively, with a vacuum cleaner.  And all of that is only in the first five minutes or so of 'Dead Meat'.  The hippie chick then meets up with a young farmer.  They kill some zombies then meet up with some crazy old guy, his mongoloid wife and some random little fat girl.  The five then start trying to make their way out of the zombie infected countryside.

The movie has zero character development and not much plot other than the hide, be attacked by a zombie, kill it, then run, hide, repeat.  Thats the basic gist of the film(and most zombie flicks for that matter).  There are some things that standout though in this flick that puts it above much of the other low budget horror that floods the market:  the camera work and cinematography are excellent, the performances are good, and the gore is inventive.  Plus, its got killer freaking cows in it and thats just awesome.

But the best part of the film is that of the crazy old man named Cathal.  He's old, crotchety, and picks fights with everyone constantly.  He's a bitter old bastard but just hilarious.  He takes so much joy when he gets to hang out of a moving minivan and literally knock the jaw off of some zombie woman with his old cricket mallet.  He's actually very, very funny.

So with its likeable actors, fun gore, fast-paced plotting, and evil cows, 'Dead Meat' overcomes its small budget and paper-thin storyline to make one of the more memorable horror flicks that I've seen a quite a while.  Definitely worth seeing."
518,1.0,"First off, thank you M*chelin, W@chovia, et.al., for sponsoring and thank you Sci-Fi Channel for showing this utterly horrible excuse for a movie before it was released on DVD. By doing so, I had a chance to see it and immediately realize why it was never released in theaters.  This made-in-Australia ""film"" is based (loosely) on a comic book produced by Marvel comics, the same people that brought us Spiderman, Fantastic Four, Blade, Hulk, etc.  Marvel has brought back ""Man-Thing"" several times since his introduction in the 70's, but all the stories that are stolen...uh, I mean BORROWED by this film are from the 70's run of comics written by Steve Gerber (who this horrible movie ""honors"" by naming a villain after him).

  Basically, the plot of this movie goes: Evil, obvious, redneck Nazis (their company's symbol is an oh-so-obvious Swastika) try to destroy the eco-system of a never-been-to-the-real-bayou, fantasy-land, I-was-obviously-born-in-Australia, version of the ""BAYOU.""  ""YANKEE"" (i.e. non-consanguinious and speaks with a ""regular"" American accent) Sheriff, School Teacher and Native American Shaman (I think that's what he's supposed to be.  It's a fine line between ""spiritual"" and ""incapacitated"" with this guy's ""acting"") try to stop them. In the end they are ""helped"" (in that he tries to kill them) by...Man-Thing.  Hey, still awake?  Well, it gets better...

  The movie...er, I mean, ""movie,"" suffers greatly from the fact that someone decided to save a few sheckels and film the entire project in...AUSTRALIA, with an all-Australian cast trying oh-so-hard to speak with Southern-American accents.  I guess if you are like Avi Arad, one of the main producers of this movie, and grew up in the Mediterranean, everything other than Henry Kissinger's gorgeous brogue sounds the same to you.  Well, if you are reading this, you are probably an American and you WILL tell the difference.  See, this alone will make you feel smart; just by virtue of where YOU WERE BORN, you are more aware of the world around you than the people that were actually PAID MONEY to make this piece of junk.

  To me, the funniest part of this movie was its view of the Florida Everglades, the setting of the story in the comics.  Here's a simple I.Q. test the producers, writers and editors of this movie failed: the Florida Everglades are in which state?  Florida?  You are right!  The idiots mentioned above blend Cajuns from Lousiana, Voodoo from the Caribbean and Lousiana and lots of trite stereotypes into their green-lensed ""SWAMP."" This ""swamp"" looks like what it actually is: Australian mangroves filmed through a green lens put over the camera, with a few strands of Spanish moss tossed here and there.  Sad.  These punks should know better, and you punks watching should be insulted that THEY think they can fool you.

  This leads me to my main point: if the producers of this film wanted to portray the area of the world they ATTEMPTED to portray in this ""film"" they should have actually GONE THERE!  Get on a plane and go to the freaking Florida Everglades!  TALK to the people there!  Maybe even HIRE some of them!  Better yet, FILM THE MOVIE in the Everglades!  How much more money could it have cost?  Seriously!  If the people in the area you are portraying are as dumb as you portray them, why not go there, pay them in porno and beer and film their primeval nescience?  Instead, what we get with ""Man Thing"" is idiocy and ignorance given a level it doesn't deserve: actors struggling (and failing) to portray people that are (supposedly) beneath them in both social and mental status.  This lack of authenticity leads the audience to assume that the type of people ""Man-Thing"" seeks to portray as actual Southerners, no longer exist.  In other words, just because the writers and producers of this crap couldn't find the stereotypes they wanted in our United States, they went to another country and paid to create the monsters they knew existed.  Man, oh man, a Cultural Anthropologist could have a field day with this movie.

  Ugh.  Anyway, to sum up, ""Man-Thing"" is:
1.) Boring
2.) Predictable
3.) Cheap looking
4.) Poorly acted
5.) Insulting to everyone that grew up south of Delaware
6.) A waste of money

If you want a good ""Swamp Monster"" film, I would suggest:
""SWAMP THING""  either #1 (Adrienne Barbeau) or #2 (with Heather Locklear!) or an old episode of the 70's TV show ""Kolchak the Night Stalker"" entitled ""The Spanish Moss Murders.""  Better yet, if you want to know more about ""Man-Thing,"" go to your local comic-shop and buy some old back-issues of ""Adventure into Fear"" and Manny's solo-title ""Man-Thing.""  Don't waste your money or your mind's memory cells on this tripe."
519,1.0,"Lotsa people whine about how it's got rich people and I don't care about them, and whatever, but that doesn't even matter.  This show is just..... so...... boring..... God! It's un-freaking believable.  That 'Mad Money' show on CNBC is 10 times more entertaining than this, and it's about freaking stocks.  I'll admit, I've only watched this show for like 30 minutes, total, but that's way more than enough.  Wow, they're sitting on the beach. Fascinating.  Never seen that before.  Also, conversation between teenaged girls is the absolute epitome of banality, particularly stupid ones, like the ones featured on this show.  The show has a few good points, however.  Many of the people have hilarious names (Lo, Talan etc.)  Also, they tend to wear moronic looking sunglasses, which are pretty funny to look at.  Also, there's that one fat chick, who I like to make fun of.  Hey fatty, you're fat.  But all that grows tiresome after a few minutes."
520,4.0,"In this I guess you can say alternate reality baseball is the sport of sports and in a tournament anything goes, even death. Because when you're playing the game you can get away with it. Since Gedo High hadn't been playing for many years Seido High thought they would have a very easy year. But then they hear the news that Gedo High has just returned from its slaughter on America and is ready for more. The Principal is definitely freaking out, and then he comes upon Jubei who definitely has skills in playing the game. But Jubei has taken a vow never to play baseball again. Luckily the Principal is able to convince Jubei to play once again, and the game is on. Its Cromartie high meets Shaun of the dead meets baseball. From the team that brought you Versus you must expect this to be a great movie, and yeah it pretty much is.

From what I've found out it was based on a graphic novel by which author I'm not sure but there is a short introduction in the beginning of the movie. I think what I liked the most had to be the two musical sequences where one song talked about why Jubei did not play baseball anymore and the other I can't really remember anymore but I think it was them starting to play baseball again. I must add that the movie also stars the same guy who stars in Versus. This movie is also not as hard to explain as Versus was. The story is pretty much about these two schools who are playing baseball and all one team does is slaughter the other. But seriously while watching this you kind of wonder why they just didn't animate it. Especially at the end where they are just pulling these whacked out things out of their asses just to make it as ridiculous as possible.

I haven't had time yet to check out the special features but there are 2 making of documentaries, short films, a commentary track, deleted scenes, outtakes and a music video. Also if you didn't like Versus or even Happiness of the Katakuris you will not like this movie. But if you did liket those films then you will love Battlefield Baseball. This film is my favorite gift from this past Christmas. It's just so ridiculous you have to like it."
521,5.0,I just freaking love this show. It is one of my favorites and I love that the entire family are fans of it and we all can watch it together.
522,2.0,"When I saw 08th MS Team I thought I was gonna see a realistic war drama, but what I got instead was a very cliched and subpar anime. First of all, for a side-story that focuses on the 08th MS Team, they really aren't that interesting:

Shiro: A very bland main character who says that he hates Zeon but never really proves it.
Michel: Comic relief butt monkey who had way too much screentime which seriously messed with the tone.
Karen: She was a former medical student and her husband died and... that's it. She has virtually no character.
Sanders: The ""Shinigami"" but since the anime is so light-hearted and cliche you know no member of the team is gonna die.
Eledore: Almost died... then came back as if nothing happened.

The first episode was great, but then the plot lags and nothing really happens for like six or seven episodes until finally Aina comes back, then some other things happen and then we have the Norris's Gouf Custom episode which is really the only really outstanding thing about this OVA and then we have a stupid Apsalus fight which was not ""realistic"" in the slightest followed up by a rather bizarre and surreal final episode. Ginias is whatever, the Federation is portrayed as incredibly dumb for the sake of forced drama (telling the GM Sniper to shoot Shiro's EZ instead of the freaking Apsalus which was the real threat), and none of the good guys die. Seriously. Only the bad guys die... Shiro and Aina receive a point blank laser beam attack from the Apsalus and they defeat it with... a punch. So much for your realistic and griitty war drama. Very, very disappointing and seriously overrated. Even 0083 with its horrendous ending is twenty times better than this."
523,3.0,"I was somewhat disappointed in this movie. Admittedly I don't really care of Tom Cruise but I like Morgan Freeman. It was slow going and when things did pick up it never really drew me in that much to make me want to continue watching.....but I freaking paid for it so I watched to the end. So yeah, it's OK for a rainy day with nothing to do...."
524,4.0,"When your sci-fi story starts with a man who has odd dreams about a woman he's never met and who also acknowledges that his work requires a routine ""memory sweep,"" then it's a safe bet that viewers with their heads on straight will be able to have a general idea where things are headed. At the very least, it is clear from the get-go that this is one of those stories where ""nothing is as it seems.""

Very much a Tom Cruise vanity piece, Oblivion follows Jack Harper, a man who is stationed on Earth with his co-worker and lover, Victoria. At some point in the past, aliens called ""Scavs"" attacked Earth for its precious resources. They succeeded in demolishing the moon, but humans won the war in a sort of petulant ""if we can't have it, no one can"" move by detonating all of their nukes, turning most of the planet into a radiated wasteland. The humans now live on Titan, getting most of their energy from huge devices that remain on Earth, sucking up what's left of the oceans for cold fusion. Scavs remain on the planet, mostly just being irritating and trying to destroy the water suckers. These Scavs are normally dealt with by a series of robotic drones, but like all things mechanical, the drones occasionally break. It is Jack and Victoria's job to monitor the drones, fix them when they need it, and otherwise just hang out looking impossibly sexy.

Of course, things are not what they seem.

The story is actually very well-constructed and shot beautifully, and although the tale's secrets are parceled out much more slowly than is necessary (the movie could've been about thirty minutes shorter), it does lend the film a classy sober quality that might've otherwise been made cartoonish with its almost too-slick sci-fi sleekness. Every performer does a great job, although the flick doesn't ask for a whole lot from its cast, and the story lasts longer than its credits. It's a movie that lingers in the mind, which is rare these days.

There are a few rough spots, but these come mostly at the end. The movie gets a bit pretentious as it nears its close, seeming to think it's deeper and more meaningful than it actually is. There's also a pretty significant plot hole when it comes to our Good Guy finally defeating our Bad Guy, and the movie engages in a last-minute, unsatisfying cop-out in its (unnecessary) bid for a completely happy ending. These things aside, the movie is truly engaging, and although it sometimes feels like just an excuse to show off how freaking amazing Tom Cruise looks (the phrase ""for his age"" doesn't even apply), it's still pretty good fare."
525,4.0,"When your sci-fi story starts with a man who has odd dreams about a woman he's never met and who also acknowledges that his work requires a routine ""memory sweep,"" then it's a safe bet that viewers with their heads on straight will be able to have a general idea where things are headed. At the very least, it is clear from the get-go that this is one of those stories where ""nothing is as it seems.""

Very much a Tom Cruise vanity piece, Oblivion follows Jack Harper, a man who is stationed on Earth with his co-worker and lover, Victoria. At some point in the past, aliens called ""Scavs"" attacked Earth for its precious resources. They succeeded in demolishing the moon, but humans won the war in a sort of petulant ""if we can't have it, no one can"" move by detonating all of their nukes, turning most of the planet into a radiated wasteland. The humans now live on Titan, getting most of their energy from huge devices that remain on Earth, sucking up what's left of the oceans for cold fusion. Scavs remain on the planet, mostly just being irritating and trying to destroy the water suckers. These Scavs are normally dealt with by a series of robotic drones, but like all things mechanical, the drones occasionally break. It is Jack and Victoria's job to monitor the drones, fix them when they need it, and otherwise just hang out looking impossibly sexy.

Of course, things are not what they seem.

The story is actually very well-constructed and shot beautifully, and although the tale's secrets are parceled out much more slowly than is necessary (the movie could've been about thirty minutes shorter), it does lend the film a classy sober quality that might've otherwise been made cartoonish with its almost too-slick sci-fi sleekness. Every performer does a great job, although the flick doesn't ask for a whole lot from its cast, and the story lasts longer than its credits. It's a movie that lingers in the mind, which is rare these days.

There are a few rough spots, but these come mostly at the end. The movie gets a bit pretentious as it nears its close, seeming to think it's deeper and more meaningful than it actually is. There's also a pretty significant plot hole when it comes to our Good Guy finally defeating our Bad Guy, and the movie engages in a last-minute, unsatisfying cop-out in its (unnecessary) bid for a completely happy ending. These things aside, the movie is truly engaging, and although it sometimes feels like just an excuse to show off how freaking amazing Tom Cruise looks (the phrase ""for his age"" doesn't even apply), it's still pretty good fare."
526,3.0,"The best of standalone Tom Cruise has all been sci-fi in the last 10 years. Think about it. Ignore MI, which is a franchise. Now we are left with a string of hit-or-miss movies featuring old man Cruise struggling to look 25 after thousands of dollars invested in plastic surgery. Starting with Minority Report and continuing with War of the Worlds, Cruise has evolved into a sci-fi icon of sorts, very much like latter-day Charlton Heston. With Oblivion, which is essentially Top Gun plus 100 years of high-tech breakthroughs, the actor has come full circle.

The SFX are what you would expect from a movie with a $120M budget and two A-list stars. A visually stunning earth home that sits right above the clouds is where most of the melodrama takes place. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and surrogate wife Victoria Olsen (Andrea Riseborough) exchange smooches, awkward glances, and plenty of scenery chewing dialogue before Julia (Olga Kurylenko) intrudes to form one dysfunctional love triangle. At this point, I could only hope that Jack would throw Victoria off the side of their home in a sort of futuristic nod to Captain Stabbin, but the soon-to-be ex-surrogate wife is dispatched via droid instead.

Gaping logical flaws abound. Again, the home that is the setting for 2/3 of this film is situated above the clouds. With no guard rails. What if a strong gust of wind came and dragged one of the main characters off of the improbable structure? Also, I am pretty sure that in the next century, Earth's Stratosphere will still be pretty freaking cold! The surrogate couple swim around butt naked in their attached pool, while the accompanying outdoor temperature is likely below -60*F. Ice skating in Eskimo gear would be more reasonable.

There is some business with clones that I could not understand. Morgan Freeman fails to impress. Olga keeps her shirt on. Combine Moon and Prometheus and you will arrive at Oblivion, which is ultimately too milquetoast to leave a lasting impression. This is ""conservative"" sci-fi. Nice haircuts, just-ironed uniforms, and staunch patriotism give off a Jetsons vibe. But the overall flick carries as much depth as a puddle, which does not make for good post-apocalyptic cinema."
527,5.0,"I usually write product reviews.  But this time I wanted to give you my opinion of Oblivion.  Yes, its a Sci Fi Movie, with action and its also a drama.  Of course its got Tom Cruise playing the lead role of Jack.  Tom did a good job in this movie especially the action scenes, the motocross riding, and the confrontation scenes with the Scavs.  I was a little disappointed in his aha moment with Olga Kurylenko playing the role of Julia on the Empire State Building.  I mean really, the only thing he could say about a previous relationship was ""Thats Impossible""  over and over with little emotion?  Hmmmmm.  How would that make you feel?  How about some jumping up and down on Opra's couch!  Ok, that was a little harsh, but the rest of the movie he is flawless.  And how did Morgan Freeman do?  He was good, he played the role of outsmarting his enemy well with a smile, albeit somewhat hidden, but curiously given away in his new found cheek bones bulging with glee.... nearly permanently!  That's not a bad thing because it wasn't over done and quite refreshing actually. There is something that I would call more than determined when a person has a permanent smile - focused perhaps, knowing that you have finally figured out the enemy and can hardly contain yourself.  I was a little mystified of the pairing between Andrea Riseborough playing Victoria who is work partners with Tom Cruise playing the role of Jack.  Ok, she just seemed a little young I guess.  She looks beautiful of course, nearly twenty something yet work partners (who share the same house and bed) with Jack who looks, well at least 50 years old, but yet they seem to be an ""effective team"".  But what the heck do Aliens know anyways?  Which brings me to the next point.  The plot.  Yes, it was good and out of the box for sure.  I mean why send your brother aliens to battle when you can send... well, something else.  Doesn't that make more sense anyways?  Its what we do in our world right now.  And how about those special effects?  Truly, how do you get a 4000 square foot home complete with plexiglass bottom Olympic size pool, Airport tower, landing pad, medical bay, a shop to fix drones, and up 2000 to 3000 feet in the air supported on a single needle metal structure?  And have it look so freaking real?  Bravo!.... THATS IMPOSSIBLE!  LOL  5 stars! Or was that 49, 51 or 52 stars?"
528,5.0,"A friend of mine described this era of filmmaking as ""musty in the mouth"". Not sure what that means, but it somehow captures the wrongness of this era, which was tame in terms of graphic violence (thankfully; I think gore is gross) by today's standards, but captures psychological terror very well. Or perhaps it's just my childhood memories talking. This era was very unique as the 70s had all that post-60s counterculture fall-out--- Manson, one cult after another, the weird juxtaposition of cultural ultra-wholesomeness of the Osmonds and the Carpenters alongside the decadence of glam and later punk. If memory serves, people seemed to be freaking out left and right in new and different ways..anyhow, this tale is a classic yarn about a sequesterd disturbed kid who lives under the stairs in a secret cubby and voyeuristically lives through the people he watches. There are nice little visual touches, like the 'peephole' camera framing. Also, I recall his room, with its demented art, being especially disturbing. A truly unique little story when TV movies were all about how messed up society was becoming. Excellent time capsule."
529,2.0,"Unfortunately there is very little good and a whole lot of bad and a freaking raft of ugly. This documentary concerns itself with the Deadheads only, and then only the most road damaged tour rats at that. Little of the band, in fact none of the band or its music is shown or played, instead you are treated to a walk through the wilderness of Shakedown Street, ie the vendor, hard core tour parasite, parking lot scene and it is not pretty. Call it an adventure in extreme hippiedom if you will, if rambling, loaded halfwits could be considered hippies. This is the dark side of the counterculture, the self serving and drug addled side. The living in the park with no money side. Most of these folks interviewed seem to be there for the party and not the music.  This is not complete story of the Grateful Dead fans and the scene, rather it is a depressing view of the dregs of the worst tour of the Dead's worst year: 1995. We see the deterioration of the scene, the gate crashing at Deer Creek, the righteous indignation of some older deadheads and a lot of chaos. The movie ends on the very sad note of Jerry's memorial at Golden Gate Park where Bill, Mickey, Bobby and Phil give short eulogies for their fallen comrade coupled with some more interviews with fans. Many of these interviews are quite moving, and articulate, for example Merl Saunders' interview is touching and the interview with a young man whose face is obscured by his hat and monstrous beard is a thoughtful reflection on some of the best of the Deadhead culture. Other interviews touch on the sense of loss at Jerry's death and the changed nature of the Grateful Dead fan base. I suppose this section was for me the highlight. Or low light cause its really a bummer.

One could enjoy this movie as a biased view in cultural anthropology of a unique sub-culture. Just don't expect to get more than 10 percent of the whole picture because this movie only shows you a small slice of the pie during the worst year in the band's long long history. This was not my experience of the Grateful Dead. This movie is all about the surface and not the substance and never explains what made the Grateful Dead a compelling band to its fans. Then again this movie isn't about the band but the most stereotypical of its followers."
530,5.0,"Simultaneously raunchy and likeable, I Love You, Man is something that is still somewhat rare in Hollywood; a quality, side-splitting comedy conceived almost exclusively with men in mind.  Thanks to Judd Apatow and other like minded filmmakers like Todd Phillips who helmed this year's hilarious, The Hangover, the idea of a male geared comedy that is actually insanely funny, has depth and is populated with instantly likeable though highly imperfect and multi-layered characters is not such an improbable concept any longer.  Yes, there are a couple of gross outs gags (but boy are they freaking hilarious) and some of the dialogue is undeniably raunchy but it's true to life.  More often than not, it's how men interact with one another, granted albeit without the really funny observations and clever metaphors; however, it's honest in that it doesn't either glorify the crassness that is a unique component of the friendship between men or gloss over it with a broad stroke of faux respectability in order to appeal to a wider demographic.  It simply is what it is, warts (not literal) and all.  In short, it depicts men the way they are (most men, anyway) and it does so free of prejudice or chastisements.  I won't rehash the plot because it's well known and has been summarized by far more proficient reviewers than myself, so I'll stick to the characters and the actors who portray them.  No one plays this type of role more convincingly and honestly than Paul Rudd.  His Peter Klaven is the sensitive, kind, yet awkward, and somewhat insecure guy that women say they want but really mow down on their way to the misogynistic a-hole who'd sooner put out a cigarette on her scalp than show her an ounce of respect and he does it with the kind of sincerity and commitment that makes his character not only likeable but relatable.  Never annoying, he's the shy every man who wants to be part of the ""in crowd"" but simply doesn't know how to function in an unknown environment.  You not only believe him every step of the way but you're totally rooting for him.  Jason Segel as Sydney, the raging yang to Peter's sobering ying, is fantastic.  As much as I loved him in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I thought he totally rocked as Peter's best bud and mentor. This was a match made in heaven and the on-screen chemistry these two actors shared must be a director's dream.  The ease with which these very desperate characters interact is seemingly organic.  It seldom, if ever, comes across as contrived.  In fact, for me, nothing in the film had a whiff of artifice.  A quick aside, the scenes between Jon Favreau's hateful Barry and Jaime Pressly's feisty Denise were some of my favorites.  The same is true of J.K. Simmons as Peter's shoot from the hip father, Oswald Klaven.  He effortlessly stole his scenes.  On to Zooey, Peter's girlfriend.  This was another very likeable creation played admirably by Rashida Jones.  More often than not in this type of film, girlfriends and wives are shrill, manipulative  shrews that seem to live exclusively to come between their husbands/boyfriends and everyone else in their universe and thwart whatever chances there might be to have a good time.  Yes, it can be very funny at times but it can also be equally tiresome.  More often than not, as the viewer you just want to reach into the screen and beat the living excrement out of her.  In this instance that couldn't be further from the truth.  She wants Peter to have friends and to be independent rather than clingy and henpecked.  But jealousy starts rearing its ugly head when she feels Peter's attachment to Sydney is driving a wedge between the two of them.  Her concerns are valid and everyone, including Peter, knows that.  She never comes across as insensitive or more importantly irrational.  In short, this is a very charming and funny movie that manages to celebrate romantic love with the same zeal and humor as it extols the virtues of friendship.  One final comment.  Please keep your eyes open for the scene on the beach where the little girl tears into Sydney over his dog's ""indiscretion.""  I thought I'd lose it.  Too funny!!!"
531,4.0,"One has probably heard the expression, ""water water everywhere.""  Well, that's the weather report of the Japan in Honogurai Mizu No Sokokara, or Dark Water.  Dark Water was originally a collection of short stories written by Koji Suzuki, who exploded onto fame with The Ring.  The first of those stories, ""Floating Water,"" was adapted into a full-length feature in Japan, and was the second work of Suzuki adapted to the screen by Hideo Nakata.

Yoshimi Matsubara is going through a rough patch in her life.  She is involved in a custody battle with her ex-husband over her nearly six-year old daughter Ikuko, and is searching for a place to live.  That they do, in a decrepit dingy seven story apartment complex.  Encouraged by the friendly realtor, they move in to Room 305.  Unfortunately, the apartment is old, the drinking water tastes bad, and water keeps seeping through the flat's roof.  Kamiya, the elderly live-in apartment manager, makes a note of it in the log, but doesn't do a thing about it.  The water-stained spot keeps growing until one time, while resting by her sleeping daughter in bed, she wakes up to find the whole bed and pillow sopping wet!

Ikuko finds a red plastic handbag with a cute cartoon rabbit, Mimiko, up on the apartment roof.  Instead of letting Ikuko keep it, Yoshimi has Kamiya put it in the lost and found box.  There's something about cleanliness Yoshimi has, presumably her revulsion to something discarded-you know, who knows where it's been?  However, it has a tendency of turning up in weird places, which begins to scare Yoshimi.  And is Yoshimi seeing things, or was there a small girl in a yellow plastic raincoat on the fourth floor?  And is there any relation to a girl from Ikuko's kindergarten who went missing two years ago?

While Yoshimi tries to be a good single mother, things aren't easy between trying to get a job, getting off work late, and trying to pick up Ikuko from kindergarten.  She has been a very sensitive woman, having been so affected at proofreading some graphic and sadistic novels that she'd undergone psychiatric treatment, that the custody hearings raises her stress level.  Her ex, on the other hand, is a cold and calculating, but factual person, who doesn't seem too concerned with Ikuko as much as wanting to score a victory over Yoshimi.

The custody battle itself is anything but peaceful.  As Yoshimi's lawyer Kishida tells her, the mother has the advantage when the offspring is six years or younger, but things at the apartment, the red bag, and her husband's cunning tactics at revealing her mental health gets Yoshimi hysterical in full view of both her lawyer and her ex's lawyer, which helps  damage her case.

The film's noir ambience is partially due to the rain, which it does a lot of in this movie, but the darkly lit corridors and elevators of the apartment complex create an atmosphere suitable for psychological horror, for which the last half hour before the postscript is a whirlwind of suspense and scares.

Hitomi Kuroki does well in portraying Yoshimi, who has the frightening ordeal of having to live alone, provide for her daughter, and balance things out, making one sympathize with the sensitive woman.  And Rio Kanno (Ikuko) is a sweet daughter one roots for.  This single mother-child pairing worked well in the previous Suzuki adaptation Ringu.  Those who saw Ju-On (the original Grudge) will recognize Isao Yatsu (Kamiya) as Saito-san, the wheelchair-bound old man at the hospital who does the peekaboo game and silly noises.

What Psycho did for showers, Dark Water does for baths and a sink, in a scene when Ikuko turns on the tap for a glass of water and shlup!-a lock of hair comes out of the tap, freaking out the poor girl.  A well-done suspense story, equal parts custody drama, ghost story, and suspense thriller.  Oh, and given what the Americans did to Ringu with their version, I'm not even gonna bother with the American Dark Water.  Come on Hollywood, stop making rotten versions of great Japanese thrillers, fer cryin' out loud!"
532,3.0,"As an on-again, off-again follower of the Vertigo comic this is based upon, I was all geared up to hate it mightily before it had even spun up in the DVD player. With that said, it fares somewhat better than I'd expected. It isn't a raging success story, but it's not a tragic insult to the rich, lengthy source material either. Keanu Reeves is a horrible choice for the lead, no doubt about that - where the funny book Constantine is a complex, witty, bitter but charismatic subculture hero, Keanu's interpretation is as nuanced as a bag of bricks. I don't know how much I can fault the actor for that - after all, he's been playing dress-up with the same character for two decades now - but regardless of where the blame lies, he lacks the unspoken authenticity that role needs to get off the ground. Fortunately, the blow is softened somewhat by a dynamite intro sequence that may as well have been ripped straight from the pages of the comic and a decent, if indulgent, central storyline. With a full-blown war between heaven and hell at its core, it would've been very easy to get overly adventurous with the film's scope, but it wisely maintains a short focal range and that keeps things mostly grounded. It won't be finding a home on anyone's top ten list, and it's not easy to look past Keanu being Keanu (with Shia freaking LaBeouf crammed in as a throwaway sidekick), but the tone is right and the special effects work is a grand success. Not nearly what it could've been, but also not what I feared it would become."
533,5.0,"SmackDown PPVs keep coming up with awesome main events , which beat Raw main events in a snap.

Scoring: 100-93% = History! 92-85% = Awesome PPV! 84-80% = Good! 79-70%= Ok! 69-60%= Not Good! 59-50%= Bad! 49-42%= Very Bad! 41-38%= Save Your Money! 37% or less is trash :). There were 7 matches so the total score is out of 70.

1. WWE Tag Team Championship

MNM vs. Hardcore Holly & Charlie Haas

This was a pretty good opener for the ppv to hype up the crowd. You can see a match like this on SmackDown or Velocity. Nothing really impressive, but a great opener.

Winners: MNM

Score: 6.9/10

2. Big Show vs. Carlito (Matt Morgan @ ringside)

This match was one of the shortest and worst matches of this ppv. Carlito got beat down badly by Big Show, and then Matt Morgan interfierd and F-5ed the Big Show. That was actually impressive.

Winner: Carlito

Score: 4.7/10

3. Cruiserweight Championship

Paul London vs. Chavo Guerrero

Well as we know SmackDown is all about Cruiserweight, and this match was very awesome! Watching these 2 Cruiserweight battle it out was awesome.

Winner: Paul London

Score: 8.7/10

4. Kurt Angle vs. Booker T

What a match this was! So many near falls , awesome wrestling action! At the end Booker T handcuffed Angle to the top rope of the ring. So Booker and Sharmell beat the hell out of handcuffed Kurt Angle. Something worth to see!

Winner: Booker T

Score: 9.8/10

5. United States Championship

Orlando Jordan vs. Heidenreich

Well this match was boring I will admit it. Nothing special. Only that Heidenreich brought a girl Alex to ringside and read the poem to her. Other than that you can sleep through this.

Winner: Orlando Jordan

Score: 5.5/10

6. Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero

What an imotional match between these two! Why Eddie Why? Because Eddie cannot beat Mysterio thats why. This match was so  awesome I couldn't rip my eyes of the screen. At the end Eddie got DQ'ed for using a steel chair and beating the hell out of Rey.

Winner: Rey Mysterio

Score: 10/10

7. WWE Championship

I Quit Match

John Cena (punk) vs. JBL (wrestling god)

I am sick and tired of John Cena. This match was awesome brutal and everything a hardcore fan wants to see! JBL went face first into the TV, John Cena bled all over the place, tables, chairs and ton of choking with wires! I mean SmackDown is pretty good with main events you have to admit it! But the end of this match was the worst i've ever seen. JBL quit for no reason even before Cena hit him. The winner of this match should've been JBL. Hes the wrestling god! Hes the one who carried this business for a year now. And being so disrespectful to him is ugly! John Cena , freaking ugly punk, im sick and tired of him like all of you are. He should get fired thats what! I will lower the score since the end was awful, other than that this match is a winner!

Winner: John Cena (grrrr)

Score: 9.0/10

The bonuses of the DVD were awesome. I liked the interview between Carlito and Matt Morgan , that was so funny! I give some points for the extras.

*BONUS POINTS* +2.5

So the total adds up to *57.1* out of 70. That will be 81%, which means this PPV is *good*. I think this score is pretty good for this PPV, but I hope John Cena loses his title one day."
534,5.0,"I got this on Netflix, not really knowing anything about it (except the short little blurb NF provided).  This was one of the best films I have ever seen.  Superb plot, wonderfully imagined and put together, this film has it all:  tragedy, comedy, artistry, symbolism, humanity, obscure references, mystery, and a few violent scenes that made me shut my eyes...something I did NOT do in movies like ""Saw"" or Tarantino's ""Hostel"", which showcased ""super-violence"" in a comic book sort of way.  This was the real deal...freaking terrifying.

Then, I got online and found out this film won the Grand Jury Prize in Cannes (2004), and is generally regarded as a masterpiece by fellow filmakers, including Tarantino (Cannes Jury Chairman that year).

Strangely enough, I thought of him a couple times while watching the movie.  I thought he'd really like this film.  What do ya know...  =)"
535,2.0,"I think the latter. I apologize if I offend Vincent Gallo/Vincent Gallo Fans, but this was one of the biggest wastes of time I've ever experienced.  I loved Buffalo 66, but what the heck was this?!  One hour and 15 minutes of Gallo's character driving across country. You could watch this movie in maybe 20 minutes if you put it on fast forward, while using the subtitle option on your DVD player.  There is little to no dialogue of any importance. The whole movie is summed up in the last 15 minutes of the movie, when we finally see Gallo's monster phallus and Chloe Sevigny servicing it. The story itself is very sad, and really could've been done better with a rewrite (including some freaking dialogue) and a few extra likeable characters. I really wanted to like this movie, and I felt kind of cheated."
536,3.0,"It should be a good thing that the ones doing ""Eye 2"" are the Pang Brothers, who created the first. And it should be good that it technically isn't a sequel to the first ""Eye"" movie.

But the Pang Bros don't quite catch lightning in a bottle for ""Eye 2,"" which has some wonderful horror moments and unique twists, but has a rather predictable plot and a heroine who seems pretty emotionally unstable. It's an entertaining horror flick, but it feels like it could have been more -- and the most interesting parts of it involve Buddhist theology.

After a huge farewell shopping spree, Joey Cheng (Qi Shu) overdoses on pills. Why? Because her weak, guilt-ridden married lover has finally dumped her. Fortunately she's found in time, and after a stay in the hospital, she heads back to China -- where she finds that she's also pregnant. But even creepier, she's starting to see people -- and creatures -- that aren't there.

But seeing them isn't everything. The ghosts are starting to interfere in others' lives -- one of them saves her from a rapist, and she sees another trying to enter the body of a newborn baby, much to her horror. The increasingly unstable Joey doesn't know how to keep the the ghosts from attacking her baby, and she'll take drastic action to keep them from succeeding...

""Eye 2"" is actually more fascinating as a study of Buddhist philosophy (only touched on in the first movie) than as a horror movie. In fact, the Pang boys drop a giant hint about the ghosts' intentions early on, so expect to know what's going on long before Joey ever figures it out -- lots of karma and atonement here. This fascinating aspect almost makes up for the fact that as a horror movie, it... really isn't.

Danny and Oxide Pang manage to conjure up a very creepy atmosphere at times, with traditional Korean spooks, a rape scare and a healthy dose of blood'n'gore, as well as the grey-faced dead who hang around pregnant women. Unfortunately the plot is a bit flat, without much mystery or suspense -- it's basically a series of scenes where Joey sees ghosts and acts crazily. Creepy, but rather plotless.

Nor is Joey a particularly compelling character -- she seems rather unstable to start with (what with the repeated suicide attempts and adulterous affairs), although she's a bit more likable by the finale. And Qi Shu does a decent job with her, almost overacting but usually staying behind the line, even when she's screaming about ghosts under the table or freaking out when she sees mysterious creatures.

""The Eye 2"" suffers from a slack middle section, but the beginning and ending (and some of the ghost scenes) are wonderful and quite creepy. Worth watching, though the plot is lacking."
537,3.0,"The movie itself gets 5 stars without question.  Clearly I was paying zero attention when I purchased this product and ended up with a freaking full screen version of the movie.  Seeing as this review is for the product and not the movie itself (or at least not entirely for the movie itself), I have to average the 1 star for a full screen edition with the 5 stars the masterpiece deserves.  Be forewarned, if you love this movie but are picky about your formatting (let's be honest, who really likes full screen?), spend the couple extra bucks to get widescreen.  Enough said."
538,4.0,"While I haven't seen the original 1920 German release of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, I did get a chance to see the 1962 version last night, and from the various reviews I've read on both, they don't seem to share a lot in common.  The 1962 version, with the screenplay written by Robert Bloch (Psycho, Torture Garden), was produced and directed by Roger Kay (""Perry Mason"", ""Naked City"") and features Glynis Johns (Papa's Delicate Condition, Mary Poppins) and Dan O'Herlihy (Halloween III: Season of the Witch, RoboCop).  Also appearing is Richard Davalos (Kelly's Heroes), Constance Ford (A Summer Place), Lawrence Dobkin (Patton), J. Pat O'Malley (The Wind in the Willows), and Estelle Winwood (The Magic Sword, Dead Ringer), whom I best remember as the character Miss Withers, the elderly, flatulent companion to Miss Jessica Marbles, in the film Murder by Death (1976).

As the film begins we see an attractive young blonde woman named Jane Lindstrom (Johns) tooling down a lonely road in a compact convertible.  After a blow out, she's forced to hoof it to a gated residence looking for help.  Before I proceed I'd recommend anyone who drives a car should at least learn how to change a tire, as if this were a skill Jane possessed, it might have saved her from the psychological nightmare she's about to endure.  Anyway, turns out the swanky residence is home to an individual named Dr. Caligari (O'Herlihy), a psychoanalyst of sorts who, at first, seems completely charming and very hospitable, to the point of allowing Jane to spend the night due to the fact her car seems to have suffered a bit more damage than a flat tire.  Things take a turn for the strange the next day as Jane, thinking she'll be leaving soon, has an upsetting encounter with Caligari, who begins asking her some rather intimate questions, resulting in Jane storming out of his study and discovering she's basically a prisoner in Caligari's house, which is essentially a fortress with its electric iron gates and guards both of the human and canine variety.  Later on Jane meets other, various residents of the house, but there's a certain oddness about their behavior, something she can't quite put her finger on...over the next couple of days Jane, who's quite the drama queen I might add, spends her time trying to figure a way out, that is when she's not freaking out.  Various opportunities for escape seem to present themselves, only to vanish just as quickly, forcing Jane to come to the realization that perhaps there's only one, real way out of her nightmare.  Eventually Jane believes she's got things figured out, but one's perceptions can be deceiving, especially given the fact everything's relative...

If you're familiar with Robert Bloch you'll know his tales tend to feature a strong, psychological aspect, and that's definitely the case here.  I did enjoy this film, but I have to say the first hour or so was quite frustrating as it seemed to move along very slowly, and the dialogue felt continually disjointed in that the mode in which some of the characters spoke wasn't something that seemed necessarily normal to me, especially with Jane herself.  It's hard to describe, but if you've seen the film you probably know what I'm talking about.  As far as the plot, after a while, but well before the surprise ending, I did sort of figure out what was going on, even though I was fuzzy on many of the actual specifics.  This wasn't because I read up on the film prior to seeing it, but more so because I'm familiar with some of Bloch's other works.  As I mentioned earlier, the film does sort of crawl along (for the first hour or so), but the last fifteen or twenty minutes made up for the rest as the revelations come pouring out like a perforated piata spilling its goodies.  I've tried to avoid revealing any of the good stuff for those who haven't had a chance to see the film, as those bits should be seen rather than related in a review.  The story reminded me a lot of the late 1960s television show ""The Prisoner"", featuring Patrick McGoohan, in that both featured a central character trapped in unfamiliar, controlled surroundings populated with odd characters, few of whom seem able, or willing, to help.  There was one aspect of the story that really annoyed the heck out of me and that comes as Jane, after various escape attempts have been thwarted, contemplates what she perceives to be her only, viable means of escape, one that includes taking an over dose of sleeping pills.  Now get this, she's been prisoner for all of two days and she's already thinking about taking her own life?  It wasn't like she was being physically tortured or forced to live in unbearable surroundings.  I suppose everyone has his or her breaking point, but I mean come on, how are you going to throw in the towel after two days?  Now you can see what I mean when I referred to Jane as a drama queen earlier.  Suck it up, grow a pair, and find a way out, or die trying.  As I said, I did have a general idea what was going on before the big revelation, but that really didn't lessen the surprise too much as I didn't have much in the way of specifics nailed down.  I really liked how the pieces eventually fit together, even if some of them created some uncomfortable thoughts (I'm speaking specifically of the character of Mark, played by Richard Davalos, and his perceived relationship with Jane).  All in all a fairly effective, often frustrating, psychological thriller, with a decent payoff.

The DVD features both the widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) and fullscreen (1.33:1) of the film, and the picture quality is quite good.  The audio, available in Dolby Digital stereo and mono in English, and Dolby Digital mono in Spanish, comes through very well.  There's really not much in the way of extras except for a theatrical trailer for the film and subtitles in both English and Spanish.

539,2.0,"I took my daughter to see this movie just after Christmas.  I heard mostly good reviews about it and it seemed like a very good movie from what I saw from the trailers (the computer graphics looked amazing).  But I also heard from many parents I knew that their children were so frightened by this movie that they had to leave the theater early.  I sort of poo-poohed them, thinking that some kids were afraid of everything.  I wish I hadn't.

There were only two good things about this movie.  1.  The scenery is (mostly) beautiful beyond belief and looks real, and 2.  my daughter was not frightened, though I wouldn't have been surprised if she was.  If I was three years old and saw this movie, I would have probably screamed the whole way through.  It's not like any Christmas movie I've ever seen.  There's nothing cheerful or uplifting about it.  It's very dark, depressing, & scary.  It's much more reminscient of a Halloween movie than a Christmas one.  I wish I had never taken my daughter to see it.  The theme seemed to be, ""If you don't believe in Santa Claus, you're going to have to go on a train ride from hell and scare the pants off of you.""  That doesn't seem to be a very good thing to tell young children.

Not only does it not have a very good story, but the characters are very unoriginal and wooden too.  They all only have one quality--the main character is brave, maybe too brave (he climbs onto the top of a moving train in the middle of a snow storm to get a friend's train ticket for example), one is saintly, one is withdrawn and depressed, while another is annoying beyond belief.  None were even the slightest bit interesting.  Though the scenery was realistic, the human characters were stiff and lifeless, resembling the animatronic characters on Disney Rides.  Far away they look real enough, but when you get closer, it's more than obvious they're only manniquins.

I figured while watching the movie that when the traumatic train ride was over that the North Pole would be amazing and stunningly beautiful.  I was wrong about that too.  The town at the North Pole looked like something you'd see behind the Iron Curtain in the 1950's, boring, bland, and desolate, while all the elves (all male and all clones of each other) and even Santa, looked a little bit creepy.  Near the end, the elves enjoy a concert put on by than no other than Aerosmith, which seemed very odd and didn't fit with the overly serious & melancholy tone of the movie.

I would definitely not recommend this movie, especially for young children.  I only gave it two stars because of the incredible background scenery and the train (which is designed to perfection and looks like it could be real.)  Other than that, it's not very good at all.  Maybe model train enthusiasts would like it, or people who enjoy freaking out young children, but other than that, I can't think of anyone else who would possibly enjoy this movie."
540,1.0,"The Apocalypse must surely be upon us! If the immense popularity of a mock-umentary film like `Borat' ('06) isn't a sign of the impending demise of Western Civilization then I don't know what is. Lewd, crude, demeaning and repulsive are just a few of the words that come to mind when I recall viewing this movie. Oh yes I forgot, not funny. It reminds me of the now defunct `Tom Green Show' that aired on MTV several years ago, it has that same type of documentary style in your face humor with Tom acting weird in public and freaking people out. `Borat' is kind of like Tom Green with an accent. There are a few funny sequences like the gypsy tears bit at a yard sale and the Mr. Jesus material was enjoyable, but the good moments are very few and far between.

I've been told that I'm completely missing the point of the movie. It's supposed to be offensive, afterall it's pointing out societal norms and beliefs that are in and of themselves offensive. That's the point. I get the point and I'm not against scathing political or social satire, I just didn't enjoy this attempt.

This film is definitely worth seeing ~ NOT!"

542,1.0,"I don't doubt that Born Into Brothels is a fascinating take on an overlooked subject. The film is visually stunning and has a story arc made all the more dramatic by the fact that, of course, it's a documentary. One minor problem, no big deal, really, but, ah, AMERICANS DON'T SPEAK BENGALI!! PUT SOME F*&%ING SUBTITLES ON THERE! I can't just 'wing it' and pick up a new language on the fly, guy. What, I'm supposed to tap into my past life in India ova heah??

Evidently, the film *does* offer subtitles (like, duh!), but the DVD has some serious glitches in presenting them. Shy DVD, aren't you? The first time I ran it on my Toshiba TV/DVD/VCR, I got nothin'. After about thirty minutes where I thought I was losing my mind I gave up and put it on my iBook. Voila, subtitles. Then I put it *back* on my Toshiba, skipped to chapter two, and the subtitles were back again. I think the first line of the film was, ""What are you freaking out for? We were here the whole time, honestly."" I'm glad to finally reconnoiter with them, but Christ, you shouldn't have to pay $30 just to play hide-and-seek with the English language. It's time for a serious product recall all up in here, y'all!!

Oh and there's a trailer for Murderball, a tremendous film featuring Winona Ryder's last eight boyfriends. Enjoy."
543,5.0,"Perhaps a movie that exposes a raw seam of racial hatred and frustration shouldn't be compared with a finely crafted piece of blown glass or a beautifully balanced symphony, But ""Crash"" brings the same level of care and artistry to the movies that is regularly found in the fine arts. The story begins and ends on a desolate road after a nighttime car crash. Don Cheadle and his Hispanic partner/lover (Jennifer Esposito) start the film by recovering from a rear-end collision involving an Asian character who is not seen again until 3/4 of the way through the film. The film backtracks several days, then follows Cheadle and a half-dozen other characters until they come full circle to the same roadside, and an unexpected discovery.

Artistic styling aside, the film scrapes away the layers of politeness that usually veil racist and ethnic suspicions. A white liberal yuppie DA and his wife (Brendan Fasier and a self-controlled Sandra Bullock) deal with a crime by freaking out at the young Hispanic man who comes to change the locks. An Iranian shopkeeper is certain that his is being cheated, and arms himself against perceived enemies. A bigoted LAPD cop (fabulous Matt Dillon) may be a black women's best friend when trouble strikes. A couple of blacks walking through a white shopping district complain bitterly about stereotyping, all the while planning a heist. Irony (sometimes rather obvious) abounds, as members of oppressed races spout the most vile, ignorant and bigoted claims about each other, and about themselves.

Director Paul Haggis sees his film as a way to deal with racism by exposing it to the open air. Viewers might debate the wisdom of that course and object to the way California is depicted as a roiling cauldron of racial animosity.. But the film's message, though fairly obvious, does not get in the way of a great story. Wonderful performances, great writing and a emotional ride."
544,5.0,"it seemed this year that brokeback mountain would sweep the oscar's claiming the best picture award and directing, well it sorta succeded. in a surpries move, the film that claimed best picture was this movie, crash. hearing this, i soon got on it and headed straight to the video store to get it and after watching it, i can see why. the film is set in a matter of 36 hours were the lives of many people suddenly converge from whites, blacks, hispanics, middle easterns, and racists. it wins on many levels from the performences, the issues, and how even today, there is still cultural divide. the ones i thougth were great was sandra bullock's character freaking out over how the locks were being set by a hispanic, when matt dillon's bigot cop saves the woman he tried to put away the previous night from a car crash, and like mentioned before, dillon's character trying to send a black couple to jail. these moments and others prove that crash does deserve the best picture award but i still feel that brokeback should have won, i thought that was a great film and thats coming from a straight person but oh well, we'll get over it (just like shakespear in love beating saving private ryan). so, see the best picture of 2005 but not really. also, if you liked crash, try to see the runner up but true winner brokeback mountain."
545,5.0,"Enterprise Season Three has been touted as one long episode, and I have to agree, but I liked it just the same. Yes there weren't 20 something  episodes about different planets, exploring space, meeting and greeting resident and hostile alien species. This was one season, full of one basic storyline, saving earth from the xindi weapon. Crossing into the expanse was as if the crew was crossing into ""junior"" year of space school, no more fun and games its time to get serious and think about the future. We get to see the crew of the enterprise grow both internally and closer to eachother, especially Tripp and T'pol. The Resident science officer , to me, had the most story lines revolved around her next to the captain of course. T'pol was exploring her own emotions, relationships, job and love life throughout , talk about character growth! My favorite episodes, although all of them were amazing, were:

Impulse-I love me some zombies, and I loved me some Vulcan zombies even more! Trillium infected vulcans are downright frightening, and even worse was T'pol getting infected by it, although I loved seeing her flip out.

Exile- This was the most ""Buffy-like"" episode of star trek I have ever seen for some reason. Maybe it was the demon like telepath who got a hankering for Hoshi to become his consort till death, or maybe it was the whole crystal thing he used to magnify his powers, I still liked it though.

Twilight- Captain archer gets a spacial parasite thingee in his brain and his short term memory doesn't work, so we see the future where earth is gone and the xindi are hunting down leftover humans, and more importantly we see how loyal and loving T'pol really is towards Archer. I cried my eyes out in this one.

NorthStar- I have always always always hated ""Trek Westerns"" where on star trek they find some alien planet that has some random western motif going on, its always cheesy with its pink skyline and tumbleweeds. BUT this episode cured that hatred, it actually made sense! Aliens kidnapped humans for slaves, brought them to a planet, and the humans revolted, but never evolved technically or socially. Archer looked darn fine in that hat.

Similitude- Tripp gets hurt, and Phlox makes a clone of him called ""sim"" to transplant brain matter to tripp and save his life, Archer makes the decision to go ahead with the clone, and realizes that its not so easy to create a life that is sentient and than later have to kill it to save another life. We get to see, via ""sims"" memories from tripp, that he likes T'pol in a romantic way, and she is so sweet to give him that kiss, I seriously cried again.

Proving Ground- I am in love with the Andorians, Commander Shran is freaking brilliant, adorable, and one of the best aliens ever on star trek. He is both enemy and friend, and this is the episode that shows that dichotomy I love the ""we have come here to get some....archerite from this planet""

Doctors Orders- God, I love Phlox and a whole entire episode devoted to him? Heaven. The crew is in a stasis state and he must take care of them while they travel 4 days, he starts to hallucinate, get paranoid, and eventually has to save enterprise by himself!

There are too many to list, too many good ones. The spheres, the 5 xindi species, Degra, the constant interference from Daniels, the cliffhangers, its all just such amazing TV I cant understand any Trek fan, or sci fi nut who wouldn't love this, totally worth the bucks."
546,5.0,"If you asked most fans of this show.. what is your favorite season? More often then not they would tell you SEASON 2.  For good reason, Tales From The Crypt was sooo fresh when the 2nd season aired. There hadn't been a great horror anthology show on tv since The Twilight Zone. So this was a major breathe of fresh air.

Episodes

Dead Right - I love this episode. I have seen it so many times and in my opinion it is one of the best season openers ever. Demi Moore gives a dynamite and cold performance that works so well. Jeffrey Tambor in a fat suit does sooo much sublte work to his character that he becomes it. This episode also has a shocking finale and a great final twist. 4 out of 4

The Switch - Directed by.............. Arnold Schwarzenagger!!!!! Don't worry he handles this episode very well. This episode is just alot of fun and feels so much like an actual comic. Light and entertaining. 3 out of 4

Cutting Cards - One of the weaker of season 2 but still pretty dang good! This one may have you cringing at times. 2.5 out of 4

Til Death - A total freaking fantastic episode. Grisly and horrifying in a almost comic way. The climax is outstanding and will have you on the edge of your seat. Love it. 4 out of 4

Three's A Crowd - The season's darkest and sad episode. It's quiet and unnerving.  It's also easily the most disturbing of the season in some ways. The final shot will make you gasp. 3.5 out of 4

The Thing From The Grave - A very simple zombie story. But it is done with such fresh style that you don't care that it is so thin story wise. Teri Hatcher stars! Great episode that feels so Crypt. 3.5 out of 4

The Sacrifice - Weakest of the set but still really good. Not really horror but a revenge thriller. It works quite well and has good acting all across the board. Not very memorable in ways though. 2.5 out of 4

For Crying Out Loud - One of my favorites of season 2. Yes it's absurd. But it is sooo much fun and odd that you cannot stop watching. Interesting and original for sure. Love it. 4 out of 4

Four Sided Triangle - Another one of my easy favorites of season 2. This involves a scarecrow that may be coming to life. Patricia Arquette stars. Well done in every area. 4 out of 4

The Venriloquist's Dummy - A gross out episode. Very horryfing in every aspect. Don Rickles is great and so is the climax. Very messy episode but one of the standouts. 3.5 out of 4

Judy You're Not Yourself Today - What can I say... it's a real odd ball. Whether that is good or bad... you can decide. Carol Kane is typical Carol Kane and the whole thing is amusing. 2.5 out of 4

Fitting Punishment - Maybe my favorite of the set.  Fitting Punishent is a disturbing revenge tale. It will make you cringe and it will be hard to watch at times. A great episode with amazing performances. 4 out of 4

Korman's Kalamity - Very light, highy amusing and off the wall tale. It is funny from start to finish and never scary. Good. 3 out of 4

Lower Berth - This is classic, at the end you will see why. I loved it. They could have almost done this for season 1. 3.5 out of 4

Mute Witness To Murder - Yes! Another classic. One of the most suspensful for sure. I was hooked from start to finish. It's one of those tales you cannot wait to see how it will wrap up. 4 out of 4

Television Terror - The scariest episode on season 2. Really. This is one great haunted house tale. The atmosphere and music are spot on. So is Morton Downey Jr. All is great here. Flawless. 4 out of 4

My Brother's Keeper - Weaker for a season 2 tale but still a great watch. Not much to say. It's good though! 3 out of 4

The Secret - Great vampire story. One of the most entertaining of the set easily. A great episode. 3.5 out of 4

There you have it! Tales From The Crypt season 2 is a must buy."
547,4.0,"I've been on a horror movie kick lately, and since the genre seems to be making a comeback, that's a good thing. Plenty of movies to choose from, often from a new generation of filmmakers inspired by the same bunch of movies and directors that I was freaking out to way back when. Movies like Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy; John Carpenter's The Thing; Tobe Hooper's first couple Texas Chainsaw Massacre films; George Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead - their influences are all over the place.

Granted, just like the good old days, there's a lot of trash to weed through to find the gems, but they're out there. And one of the brightest of the bunch is writer/director Neil Marshall's unrated version of The Descent, a nifty slice of hands-over-your-eyes horror for the new millennium. It's 'Jaws' for the spelunking crowd. If I ever had any silly ideas about going cave-diving prior to watching this, I sure don't now.

Marshall sets the stage by briefly focusing on a small group of thrill-seeking friends, all ladies, out on a white water rafting trip. A quick, my-husband-is-cheating-on-me-with-my-best-friend-Juno plot point later; Marshall adds the proverbial hump to his heroine's back: on the drive back to the cabin, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) and her family get into a gruesome accident, killing both her husband and her young daughter.

Cut to a year later. Sarah's out of the hospital, and is heading for a reunion with her buddies - a spelunking expedition led by the badass-I-slept-with-your-dead-husband-and-I-have-a-massive-chip-on-my-shoulder-Juno (played by the super-hot Natalie Jackson Mendoza - yum!), which quickly turns out to be a... well, a messy mistake for all concerned.

After loving director Marshall's first film, Dog Soldiers (a low-budget wonder with a Rambo-ish twist on the werewolf horror genre), I was psyched to see what he could do with a real budget, and Marshall doesn't disappoint - especially on video. The film is everything a horror film should be, from a fans perspective anyway: bloody, scary, gruesome fun. There are real chills here, from the appropriately dark, dank, utterly claustrophobic sets; all the way to the creepy-crawly critters, a particularly nasty combination of Tolkien's wicked Gollum and F.W. Murnau's original movie vampire, Nosferatu.

Even with only his second film under his belt, Marshall shows that he's a master at setting a mood, constructing action-packed scenes while still letting his actors explore their characters nuances. And visually, the film is striking - the sets are amazingly realistic, and the make-up/monster special effects are as good as it gets - kudos to the production design team. And with the unrated version, here's one of those rare things, the reason for DVD to be: we can see Marshall's dark vision the way he meant us to, with the original, unrelentingly bleak ending intact, as events overwhelm her, and Sarah finally gives in to her escalating madness.

Now, that's what horror movies are all about. Thanks, Mr. Marshall. Here's to the new master. Can't wait for number three."
548,4.0,"I went to see this movie on opening night, not having seen the trailer, not having seen the original movie nor having the pleasure to read the book. I had a general idea what it was about, but I hate how trailers these days leave nothing to the imagination. I noticed that with scary movies this is the way to go!

Many of you know the premises and more history than I would probably know, so I won't repeat it.

Other than the house being freaking creepy, demonic heart attack on a plate, it was really scary to see this loving family movie into it, where every pore of your body wanted to yell at them not to go in there.

Sitting there in the dark theater, and wanting to close my eyes all the time, I felt like everyone's breathing stopped at certain parts. One of the creepiest parts is when the little boy goes to the bathroom. Yeah, for some reason bathroom scenes are freaking horrifying lately, and this one was the worst! I mean the best scary bathroom trip I've ever seen! &#61514;

The characters are very real and I rooted and cared about them, so watching crazy stuff take over them and make them turn against each other was tough.

Overall a very good scary, make you jump on your seat, bite your tongue and close at least one eye flick!

Very enjoyable, just don't compare it to everything else ever made and have fun, watch it with an open mind. It will blow you away."
549,4.0,"I was never a big fan of the original 70's movie. It was slow, mostly uneventful with so-so acting and not much horror for my tastes. Many felt it was more of a psychological film and created its scares through that, but I never felt that movie ever rose to that kind of terror. Hearing about this remake I was interested but figured it would probably be close to the original, and therefore not very interesting to me. Once I saw the preview though and after finding out is was made in part by the writer and producer of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, I wanted to see it. And I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed.

The movie follows a family, the Lutz's, as they move into a new house for a sorid past. A year early the son of the previous owners went a little crazy because of the hauntings and voices in his head, and systematically went from room to room shooting his parents and four siblings in the head with a rifle. The father George(Ryan Reynolds) is married to a woman with three children from a previous marriage and none of the kids have really taken to him yet. Reynolds who must will remember from Nation Lampoon's Van Wilder and most recently Blade Trinity does an excellent job in his role. This is far from a comedic performance and Reynolds shows he does have some acting chops.

From his first day in the house George is constantly cold and early on the house begins to weigh down on him. He hears creaking, radios that aren't plugged in. The boat house keeps getting unlocked and the dog won't stop bothering him. Soon he's freaking out at the kids and losing his cool with his wife as he quickly spirals down into his own personnel hell created by the house and its past. The youngest daughter meanwhile meets a new friend, the ghost Jody who was the youngest sibling murdered a year before. She's a fairly nice ghost when the bad man of the house isn't making her do bad things.

Soon the daughter is fully envolved with the ghost and George is chopping wood like a madman to keep himself warm, as well as sleeping down in the basement where he thinks the only warm place is. He's also hearing more voices and piecing together the ugly past the house has. Meanwhile the mother is trying to keep her family together as best she can, although it doesn't work that well. It all leads up to an entertaing ending where George starts seeing demons in his family and we learn what really happened at the house when it was first built. It ends with a crazy George trying to hack up his family in The Shinning style as they try and escape him and the possesed house.

The acting is very well done in this movie and it has several decent scares. There's a great scene with a not so smart babysitter and the priest who tries to help the family out. And yes the fly scene with the priest is in here, and its still good. The movie builds up the scares through great pacing and an entertaining story. It's about in the middle when it comes to the gore, not to much but not too little either. The ghosts look great too and I found this film much more enjoyable than the original as well as current films like the Ring 2 and The Grudge. I reccomend going and seeing this great film right away."
550,5.0,"1. booker t vs chris benoit- Kinda boring way to start the ppv but i guess it is watachable. Good moves by both. 7/10

2. Trish vs Melina- Good womens match. Better than a regular womens match. Womens matches are getting better on raw and the storylines seem to be doing well. This is Raw's only interpromontional match out of the 3. 8/10

3. HHH vs Ric Flair- Brutal, bloody match. I was expecting them to have a 3rd match. Lots of weapons used including a screwdriver! Very dramatic match with flair getting up after 3 pedigrees.

4. Cena vs Angle- When is Cena going to lose the title!?!? This was pretty good match with tons of refs involved. A nice ddt by Cena. The day cena loses will be the best day in wrestling history. 8.5/10

5. Eric Bishoff vs Teddy Long- Wow this was going all Erik until the freaking boogeyman came and screwed raw. Raw should've won but a bad match overall. 3/10

6. 10 Man Smackdown vs Raw Elimination Match- Increadinble main event. All big men went out early. Nice performance by HBK.Kinda short but all action was good. 10/10"
551,1.0,Ok the only reason I rented this movie was because in my small town I have a store called Angeli's and they have a video store in there and it said free rental on the cover. So I rented it for free. I'm a person who loves documentaries and this one isn't a good documentary. This movie just focuses on one thing bashing Walmart. The workers who they interview in this movie make it seem like Wal-mart is the only place to get a job. Also I know that walmart sometimes isn't a great thing to come into a small community but would it be all the same if a Shopko or K-mart came in. I live in a small town the closest Walmart is a hour away in Iron Mountain and there not freaking out or anything. Even though this was a beautifully made documentary how it stays on dissing Walmart and doesn't focus on anything else is the reason I'm giving this movie 1 star. And to the producers if you want to make a good documentary don't focus on the bad focus on some of the good.
552,4.0,"This movie harkens back more to the days when Velma carried the group more.

Lots of Mummies, lots of swerves, not too convoluted, and just enough  Scooby and Shaggy freaking out.

Great movie."
553,5.0,"Another great purchase! Fantastic writing, perfect timing, great plot lines. This show just gets better and better with each season!!! I love it all! My favortie episode has to be ""Something About Dr. Mary"" - I freaking love that episode. Classic Frasier."
554,5.0,"Hey, I'm gonna admit, I haven't even seen this DVD yet, but I ordered it. Just waiting for it to get here in the mail. lol  Anyways, I can still tell you how freaking Amazing they are to see live. An amazing is probably an understatement. I'm dead serious.  I just saw them in concert this past tuesday, (oct 19) in Coral Cables, FL at the Univeristy of Miami Convocation Center. Oh my gosh, words can't even describe how good this show was. These guys are unlike any other rock band.

I had front row seats and to see them that close live singing all there amazing powerful rock tunes was an absolute privlege! There was so much energy the whole entire time and the fun never stopped.  Everyone was jumping up and down the whole time, there were mosh pits, everything! lol  They opened up with ""Your Time Has Come,"" from there latest album Out of Exile which was an excellent choice to open with.  They sang most of there hits from there first album such as like a stone, iam the highway, cohise, and set it off. Man, when they played Set It Off, that made me just realize that was the best rock concert I had been to in my life and it always will be.

Oh, and at the end, they said goodnight to us and left and it got dark, and whattya know, they come back out and sing Rage Against The Machine's ""Killing In The Name.""  And that about made everyone in the damn building the happiest people ever.

Seriously, if it wasn't for Audioslave, rock would be dead as a doornail. That's right, DEAD!!  Audioslave has so much talent.  They were born and destined to be rockstars and they sure have shown it.  I advise you, if you haven't yet, GO SEE THEM LIVE!!! And if you can't, unfortuntley, purchase this DVD right away. The memories of seeing an Audioslave concert will last with you forever whether it be seeing one live in person or on your television screen.

Audioslave, you guys ROCK!!!!!!!"
555,1.0,"I am absolutely stunned at the one-sidedness of the reviews here. As of my writing this, all 5 stars except for one 4. Perhaps you fell in love with it as children and further romanticize the memory of it because you haven't seen it since then. Such may be deserved for some things, but least of all this. It's as if you've all been brainwashed. Now it deserves a LITTLE credit considering it came from the era of the 1960s and maybe all the stuff about equality of the animals may have been an allegory for the civil rights movement, but it went beyond absurd. It is more absurd than the most tongue-in-cheek satire the South Park guys have ever been capable of creating, and it doesn't even do it deliberately.

First of all, let me get this straight. His father, Caesar, the white lion king, believed so strongly that all animals should be free and live happily that he took livestock from farms. Oh no, he didn't eat them. He FREED them. Yes, you heard me. Awww, doesn't that just warm the cockles of your heart? The image of a LION freeing domesticated livestock so that they can prance around in the jungle, or the Okavango or wherever in Africa it was supposed to be? (they wouldn't survive a week, by the way) It makes me wonder. Just WHAT did he EAT? What exactly did the just and mighty Caesar live off of? Love? It may be possible for their bodies to tolerate soy protein or something - though it has never been done in captivity, and I don't think he had crops growing, but otherwise an adult lion needs to eat 5 or 10 pounds of meat a day on average or he'll wither away and DIE! And there is nothing bad about it. They don't eat meat out of maliciousness or evil, they eat it because they need it. There is no equality of the animals, and it is a lousy allegory to racial issues among humans. That's the mistake Hitler made in his Mein Kampf, equating interracial relations to interspecies relations.

Then there's the part where Kimba's teaching the other animals to talk. Now this part was worthy of George Orwell, though again, not deliberately! What with their goal to talk like a human, to WALK like a human. I couldn't help thinking 'four legs baaaaaaaaaaad, two legs gooooooodddddd!'. If Kimba learned to talk that's one thing, that's all fine and dandy. Ok, one lion that has learned to talk. Good for him. Nice for him to know that if he ever needs to he could put on a suit and a tie and maybe make it in the human world, make millions selling his biography maybe. But what came next was just... really, really annoying.

And then Kimba is just so tirelessly moralistic it's disgusting. Fighting is wrong, fighting is wrong, fighting is wrong, he repeats. Yeah, animals in the jungle should never HURT each other! That would be WRONG! Those bad old villainous hyenas, 'bullying' that poor deer. They should just go and eat some soybeans or something. Get some fast food. And be nice to each other. Yeah! Oh, and don't worry about where that meat the guy hands you actually came from, but object to the practices that procure it just the same (we actually see Kimba get fed meat by the first 'good' guy in episode 2).

Kimba first escaped the boat in episode 1 with the help of the rats who were being oppressed by those 'awful' cats, who were also given cliche sinister attributes. All they were missing were top-hats and handlebar mustaches. Maybe a damsel, a bunch of rope, and a train. It reminded me of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. And then why exactly is it he jumps into the ocean again? Because it's SAFER than being on the boat which is headed for a storm? Yes, kids, remember now! If you're on large ocean-liner and a storm is approaching, you should definitely jump overboard because it is much safer without a boat in the middle of the ocean in a storm than with one, because it just might sink! I think it would be far healthier to imitate Beavis and Butthead, don't you?

Of course, in Kimba's deals with humans, I've noticed that all the 'bad' ones are ugly while the 'good' ones are rather dashing. So trite. But of course it doesn't end there. The first bad one isn't just a poacher or something, he's a freaking A-bomb dealer! I mean, come ON! And then the first 'good' one (back to episode 2), who can talk to Kimba (this is before Kimba learns to 'speak' - of course they talk all the time and all non-human species can communicate amongst each other with COMPLETE ease - and we hear English - or Japanese if it was AVAILABLE as an audio track - but like in Garfield we're just supposed to imagine that's what the animal's saying in some sort of animal language that all animals but humans understand) because he's just so close to animals or something, and they escape together and journey across - what was that, the Sahara desert? He has a beautiful death leaving Kimba with the lesson that not all humans are 'bad'. Well, I've got news for you little leo. The good humans' garbage smells just as bad, and their cars' exhaust does too! The 'few bad ones' aren't the human threat you have to worry about. They don't have a monopoly on making your ecosystem vanish. I don't want to wipe out nature, nor am I using traditional Chinese medicine (i.e. body parts from endangered species) but I sit here writing this in my air-conditioned room on a planet with twice as many humans as it had when I was born and still more born-again believers in the manifest destiny thinking it's god's will to have large families, and you can't tell me that we won't wipe 'em out no matter how well-meaning some of us may wish to be.

Well, that's enough. In conclusion, I'd have to say, something earns camp status if it's bad enough. But this is just so bad, so NAIVE, I feel it loses it again. It's like Star Trek to the 10th power with its endless shallow morals! And it REALLY deserves an opinion to offset the crazy string of 5-star reviews by its patron brainwashees. I wish I wasn't suckered into trying this sucker out by its unanimous praise. Hopefully I can save a few other saps from the same with this warning. I started watching it thinking Disney was the shameless bad guy for not giving credit where credit was due, but you know what, I think I get them now: referring to this as an influence would be something to be embarrassed about!"
556,5.0,"Essentially this is a repeat of my Season 4 review but with different favorite episodes.  I will add though that this is the best seasons so far, the writers, producers, actors and directors are all in a groove. They know the characters, the story arcs, and the desired comedy experience all combining to a synergistic Seinfeld experience.

Seinfeld is network television comedy at its best. 10 years later as I watch these episodes, despite seeing them countless times on syndication, I laugh out loud. Each show is original, tightly written, well acted and of course freaking hysterical. Even better they have memory...or in more technical terms a long story arc which intermittently continues themes across episodes and seasons. This adds to the richness of the humor and the fullness of characters, it allows the characters to develop and even though they are frequently reprehensible, we also see ourselves in there behaviors and they become very likable. Most television comedy consists of static episodes with contrived jokes and pratfalls where the only laughing you hear is the laugh track. Not Seinfeld!

Some of my favorite episodes from Season 5 include:

The Hampton's

The Puffy Shirt

The Sniffing Accountant

The Marine Biologist

The Stand In

The bonus material is generally excellent:

- The deleted scenes are interesting, you get to see more of the show, but they generally are unfunny jokes or extraneous/redundant material, (its obvious to see why they were deleted). It helped me appreciate the creative process of comedy

- I have not watched all the commentaries but the few I did watch were not very stimulating. The commentators are too busy watching the show, such that there are long pauses between comments and when they do comment, it something like...that was funny, how did we get away with that...over and over again. Stuff you want to know they don't tell you, for example, what was it like working with Bette Midler.

- The Inside Look featurettes are very insightful as we see and hear about the creative process and the inspiration for the stories. An added bonus is the actors' anecdotes, especially Michael Richards. During the show I thought he was the weakest actor, present to just add some `low brow'. Now I how good an actor he really is; In the featurette we se a so soft spoken, relaxed, and well mannered Michael Richards (almost bordering on shy and reticent) vs. his hyperkinetic spastic Cosmo Kramer. The contrast is illuminating; he really created and made the most of that character. The other actors you can easily see inhabiting the characters but Richards was the biggest surprise.

- The menus are creative and unique per each disk, mimicking a well known local from the show. While they are interesting to watch, occasionally its hard to find the specific menu you want.

- The packaging is good as well but I disliked the packet photos which are cheesy artificial actor promo shots.

- The bloopers are hysterical, you'll be begging for more.

- Jerry Seinfeld's stand up is top notch as well.

In review this is the best network comedy out there; if you want to laugh, buy it."
557,4.0,"About time they put this sumbeetch on DVD!

I love this special.  It's just Zappa having fun with the video concept.  He's taken great live footage from two concerts and spliced them together with Bruce Bickford claymation (which is always fun, if you can't enjoy watching this stuff, you've got no business trying to enjoy FZ's music), Zappa clowning around in the ""Dub Room"" where they mixed and mastered the concert footage, FZ and his strange Italian buddy Mossimo, and a few bits of interview footage.

The footage from the earlier show featuring Napoleon Murphy Brock, Ruth Underwood, Chester (later he got to play drums for Genesis, lucky bastard) Thompson, Tom Fowler, & George Duke.  They do the improved (and hilariously pointless) ""Room Service"" bit.  We get the ""played"", ""sung"", and ""danced"" rendtitions of the reall-freaking-difficult-to-play jazz instrumental ""Approximate"".  Napoleon steals a lot of this show (which is pretty hard to do when you're on stage with FZ).  It's all a lot of fun to watch and hear.

The Early 80's performance featuring Steve Vai on ""stunt guitar"" has slightly less engaging music in my opinion.  As usual all of FZ's crew (particularly Ray Price) are in fine form, but Zappa seems a little less connected with this band.  Still some good songs (""Nig Biz"", a hilarious indictment of the Warner music label; ""Stevie's Spanking"", a graphic recounting of Vai's experiences with an unorhtodox groupie)  It would have been great to have seen some of the better tracks from this line up, like maybe ""Charlie's Enormous Mouth"" or ""Why Does It Hurt When I Pee"".

The in between stuff is fun to a degree, depending on whether you get this for just the music (which if this is the case and you call yourself a true Zappa fan, shaaaaaame on you, tsk tsk), or if you dig watching Zappa have his dry, improvisational ways with all around him (and they all seem cooperative enough).

In short, good tunes, fun footage, Zappa with two of his best line-ups (although, unfortunately, no Terry Bozzio).  Makes you kinda wonder what sorta stuff he'd be doing if he were still around."
558,5.0,"For Gawd's sake, what can I say?  It's the original Twilight Zone with William Shatner freaking out at a Gremlin in flight and a whole bunch of episodes I haven't seen for years, in the original black and white.  It wouldn't work in color.  Unless you have something against The Twilight Zone, you'll love this.  And, I am happy to report that they haven't censored Rod Serling's cigarette.  I detest smoking, but I hate censorship even more."
559,5.0,"Bought this as a gift, but I remember this being so freaking awesome when I've seen the movies on tv.  Meredith Baxter gave a performance of a lifetime she should have won an emmy.  You get two movies here, the original that aired in the Spring about Betty Broderick murdering her ex husband and his new wife and the follow up which aired in the Fall which chronicled her trial."
560,5.0,"Wow, freaking hilarious. How did they do that without any vulgarity, nudity, cursing, sex scenes and most of all,,,,, stupidity? These guys were geniuses at making comedy. To bad know one has the talent to create this today without making a repeat."
561,1.0,Ok the only reason I rented this movie was because in my small town I have a store called Angeli's and they have a video store in there and it said free rental on the cover. So I rented it for free. I'm a person who loves documentaries and this one isn't a good documentary. This movie just focuses on one thing bashing Walmart. The workers who they interview in this movie make it seem like Wal-mart is the only place to get a job. Also I know that walmart sometimes isn't a great thing to come into a small community but would it be all the same if a Shopko or K-mart came in. I live in a small town the closest Walmart is a hour away in Iron Mountain and there not freaking out or anything. Even though this was a beautifully made documentary how it stays on dissing Walmart and doesn't focus on anything else is the reason I'm giving this movie 1 star. And to the producers if you want to make a good documentary don't focus on the bad focus on some of the good.
562,5.0,"Angel, like Buffy the Vampire Slayer is one of the most enjoyable TV shows ever made. It took a few episodes before it found it's voice, or maybe I just didn't love the plots, I dunno. But I love Angel, and slightly more than Buffy actually. The show is kind of gut wrenching. Each season feels fresh and distinct from the others while still fitting well in the overall flow of the show. Despite ending prematurely, they were able to do a good job wrapping up the series. This is a great freaking show."
563,2.0,"Saw Resident Evil 2. Without going into FULL detail, allow me to say this:

What a LOAD!

Tell you what, if you liked the first movie, then watch this only if you want an excuse to create a big budget, blow-every-flipping-thing-up, bridge to another possible sequel.

I swear, Paul Anderson is films version of Piers Anthony (sp?). He doesn't know how to end a movie, so he stops them all on some freaking Joss Weadon cliffhanger.

Y'know Paul, sometimes we WANT endings to our films. We want to be able to have that last sigh of relief when a film ends. We want to feel like something is concluded. We DON'T all want to be left hanging at the end of everyone of your films. Every once and a while is fine, but not EVERY movie. That kind of crap makes me wary of wanting to see the future releases of Driver and Necropolis. Heck, if he WANTED a cliffhanger, he could have stopped the movie 5 minutes from where it did end and I would have been less irritated.

The ending isn't the only fault of this Summer ending fluff. Mila Jovavich was the best actor of the film. Now, while I'm not down playing her growing talent, look at this closer. When your highest-grade actor is an ex-super model, something is wrong. Most of the other actors had some kind of Van Damme ascent and made it hard to understand them alone. The others padded their sub par acting with guns blazing at things (most which weren't zombies, more on that later) or a blazing flurry of F-Words.

It is with that word and the pointless topless scenes that I think garnered the ""R"" rating, which is pretty flipping sad.

All the characters were stale and you began to not really care if one guy lived or died. When the characters did die, there wasn't ever that feeling of ""Aw, man, I really liked him/her too"".

Now, I KNOW the Resident Evil series isn't all about zombies. It's not a plain zombie story, sure, but they sure as hell have a lot to do with it. It played a lot into the first movie. THEY were it. THEY were the baddies, while sharing the light with the ONE Licker and the amnesia filled dude with the attitude.

The zombies this round are filler in the film. The movie just seems to flash back at them, as if to say ""Oh yeah, they're here too"". The Licker was even downplayed as a minimal threat to the people who had guns. In the first, it ransacked everything in sight and began evolving and becoming badder. This time, there's like TEN of them. You're thinking, ""Holy crap, they're screwed"".

Not necessarily so, Lois.

Instead, one guy gets offed and the rest are either shot, run over, blowed up or Crushed By Christ(TM).

Naturally, our heroes trip into a graveyard all filled with fog (that only seems to be THERE) and one of our ""Zombie Reminders"" shine as a bunch of dudes pop from the ground and start dancing around with Michael Jackson to bring in the long awaited Thriller 2: Zombie Boogaloo.

Okay, maybe not, but it would make more sense as to why they arrived than the NON reason the movie gave.

Then there's Nemesis. Ah, Nemesis. One of the biggest Baddies of them all. He was mysterious, he was tough, he wore black and he whooped your butt. Now, though, he was more like Frankenstein with a gun. He just kind of lumbered around Raccoon City, making himself known and doing very little. Then there's this hand-to-hand fight he was with Alice that's the equivalent of Nancy Fowler Archer, of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman fame, battling the Stay Puffed Marshmallow Man. They just shuffled about and twitched at each other. I couldn't tell what was going on half the time cause of Paul's EXTREME close-ups, which were, more than likely, hiding the characters physical flaws.

All of this combined makes me want to see the possibility of a three as much as I want to fork over 7.50 to see a third Star Wars.

Very Little."
564,5.0,the visuals rock. it is very scary. the music is perfect for it. this is possibly the scariest movie ever made. i jumped many times.  it was better than i expected. i think  everyone should watch it plus michelle rodriguez is freaking hott.
565,4.0,"Sure, you can find lots of little mistakes and problems with this story, and the special effects tend to be on the cheesy side, but I certainly enjoyed watching Supernova.  I don't really associate Hallmark Entertainment with disaster movies, but they certainly did a credible job with this one.  Not surprisingly, there are a few overly melodramatic moments and one incredibly unnecessary subplot, but these family entertainment guys didn't shirk from blowing a lot of things up, including the Taj Mahal and all of a major American city.  With a total runtime of almost three hours, some may find Supernova a little too long, but one must keep in mind the fact that this originally aired as a two-part television miniseries.

Things don't look very good for the Earth and everything on it.  Apparently, our sun is much older than scientists thought, and Dr. Austin Shepard (Peter Fonda) has discovered that it is about to go supernova.  Unprecedented sunspot activity will wreak havoc with Earth's communications systems, followed by huge releases of plasma from the sun's inner depths that will rain fireballs down upon the Earth; soon thereafter, the sun will expand to the point that it consumes the entire Solar System and then explode.  It's the ultimate mass extinction event.  Knowing there is nothing that can be done, Austin emails his findings to five illustrious colleagues and flies off to find himself a beach bunny and enjoy the last few days of life as we know it.  Austin's junior colleague, Dr. Chris Richardson (Luke Perry) soon finds himself at the very nexus of activity, commandeered by intelligence agent Lisa Delgado (Tia Carrere) at the bidding of a high-ranking U.S. colonel (Lance Henriksen) even before he knows what is going on.  Already well aware of Dr. Shepard's apocalyptic conclusions, America and other world governments have activated a long-secret plan to gather worthy individuals to be evacuated to underground cities.  The public at large, of course, must not be told about the imminent catastrophe the angry sun is sending their way.  Meanwhile, as if the whole destruction of the Solar System isn't quite dramatic enough by itself, we have a far-fetched and wholly unnecessary subplot about Dr. Richardson's wife and daughter being stalked by the escaped serial killer that Mrs. Richardson's testimony helped convict in the first place.

There are, of course, a number of other characters with stories of their own, but a lot of the focus of this film, apart from the scenes of wholesale destruction, revolves around the plan to try and save a remnant of civilization for any possible future.  Dr. Richardson in particular openly rebels at this idea, and I really don't understand why.  If there is any chance for mankind to survive the coming upheaval, why not go for it?  Yes, it's unfortunate that only a select few would qualify and that whoever made the selections would essentially be playing God, but isn't that better than sitting back and letting everyone on the planet die a certain death together?  Another key theme is the public's right to know.  We all know what happens when mankind faces even a local disaster - massive looting, violent protests, mayhem in the streets, etc.  Should the people of Earth really be told they are all about to die?

Maybe you're wondering how scientists could possibly come up with a way to stop the sun from exploding.  Stop wondering because there is no way to do that.  Mankind's only hope is that the brilliant Dr. Austin made a mistake somewhere in his calculations.  It wouldn't be the only mistake in this movie - take, for instance, the fact that serial killer Grant Cole is sentenced to death in a country (Australia) that does not have the death penalty, or the fact that no character in this Australian setting seems to speak with an Australian accent.  This whole story actually lends itself exceedingly well to any number of ""things I learned from this movie"" lists.  Go and check some of them out on the Internet - they're pretty darn funny.  As for the special effects, keep in mind that this was a television mini-series, not a Hollywood summer blockbuster - the effects may not be very realistic, but I figure the filmmakers did the best they could with what they had to work with.

All criticisms aside, though, I did enjoy this movie quite a bit.  Luke Perry isn't bad in the main role, Tia Carrere more than holds her on, and Lance Henriksen brings an effective sense of gravitas to the whole story.  Even Peter Fonda was good (I usually try to avoid any and all Fondas not named Bridget).  Finally, as a serious fan of science fiction and disaster films, I can't ask for much more than the idea of our sun freaking exploding.  For a production that originally aired on the Hallmark Channel, Supernova really isn't bad at all."
566,4.0,"I am as big a Star Trek fan as the next person. But I've always gagged on the horrendous prices of the full-season box sets. I watched Star Trek: The Next Generation religiously when it first was on the air, but now, large chunks of it seems dated. And badly-written. And cheesy. Not in a good way. But a lot of it was really good, too. So I'm happy to pay for the good stuff, as long as they don't make me watch the The Game, The First Duty, or most of Season 7 ever again. And while I liked Voyager and Deep Space 9 in spots, and would enjoy watching some of those episodes again, there is absolutely no freaking way I'm paying what they're asking to get ahold of them currently.

So now we get these ""fan collectives"". The episodes aren't exclusively the best of Trek - the Borg got over-used towards the end, and the two Time's Arrows episodes (from the time travel set) are about the 101st and 102nd best Next Generation episodes. There is some minor duplication amongst the sets. And those text commentaries have to be about the lamest special feature ever. But the sets are comparatively cheap, and they have episodes that are generally good at the very least (with a number of really outstanding ones in there), and for someone who likes Trek but isn't obsessive, having 14 solid episodes drawn primarily from The Next Generation but also from Voyager (and Deep Space 9 and the original series on the other sets) gives a nice variety for those of us who want an occasional Star Trek fix but don't want to sit through an entire season of episodes of hugely varying quality.

Fan polling may not exactly be the ultimate arbiter of quality. The hard-core fans who vote on these things have different tastes than the wider world (which I assume explains the inclusion of Time's Arrow). But given how badly Paramount has lost touch with reality in the management of the who Star Trek enterprise (as evidenced by the most-recent-series-which-will-go-unnamed, which started out appallingly bad and then proceeded to get worse), I'll take it."

572,3.0,"Mighty US warlord Premier Norris has become something of a mythical character in the world of b and especially in these reviews. So it was very curious that we have yet to review his latest film. Don't excuse us thinking that it was some recent straight to video Kramer home premier, this baby was released in 2005. How the mighty have fallen if Chuck hasn't done a b in 7 years and counting. He will appear in the Expendables 2 but that's like the eskimos sending an elder out on an ice raft. Chuck showed no signs of being ready to stop ramming the world with his b hammer in The Cutter however. He still had the glowing beard of flames and a mini-mullet. That's Italian. We wanted to find out what was so soul crushing that it made a man who clearly has no shame (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Top-Dog/dp/B00005QJHN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Top Dog</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forest-Warrior/dp/B002SAMMFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forest Warrior</a>) stop making beautiful b music for 7 years.

Chuck plays former FBI this is search warrant hot shot turned private investigator John Shepard. The opening scene shows us Chuck attempting to foil a kidnapping. He ultimately failed and got the kid killed but he did manage to throw the fattest kidnapper out of a window in true Myers-hillbillies-truck fashion so all in all not a bad day. Actually the killing of the kid shook Shepard to his core so when he took his next job protecting an expert diamond cutter, he promised himself he would not fail this time. We don't know how much Chuck charged but being that he was dealing with a diamond cutter we'd like to think Chuck told him""let's talk turkey $20000 you take the whole package."" Along with the old man diamond cutter Chuck had to protect his protege who was a gypsy! The reason they needed protection is because they were the only 2 gypsies on earth who could perform this impossible cut that made a diamond priceless and there was a serial killing thief after them. There was also an evil force behind the thief. It was a former nazi officer who made the cutter perform his cut on stones in a concentration camp. He was a mean guy. We wouldn't be surprised if he told the cutter to clean his freaking loop many times a day. Obviously Chuck kicks multiple butts and looked stunning doing it. He also  manages to deliver his lines in a very halting way of speaking a la Frank Costanza. The one thing we always expect from an Aaron Norris production is explosions. Well there was only one because we're guessing that's all they had money for but it was a really cool romantic explosion. Of course the two bad guys got blown up and Chuck kept his promise to the gypsies and to himself.

It is always fun to watch Chuck doing his butt whupping bad acting. It's always fun to marvel at what a complete tough guy the total gym can turn you into. What's not fun however is watching a b in which the biggest question is will Chuck give this gypsy a light rash. The plot in this one was just shallow and pedantic. It was pretty boring to tell you the truth. If Chuck wasn't in the movie it would have been a 1star effort. The funniest moments came when Chuck in his typical nice guy way told one of his old FBI buddies to go stuff himself. Then he called him a maggot. It was quite a hot rivalry. As hot as Santa and the bagelry guy? No but still good. This one is still definitely worth a view if for no other reason than it is Chuck's latest film and he was doing legitimate tough guy Chuck stuff but realize going in that you're going to have to have some decent backup laptop entertainment going. Maybe some wormholes or something. Oh and to answer that all important question, no Chuck doesn't get with the gypsy. Smart move, Chuck. Who knows when some gypsy will shrink you and sell you at a yard sale?"

575,3.0,"""Triangle"" was a mini-series with Eric Stoltz and Bruce Davidson.  It tried to explain what the Bermuda Triangle was and what caused it.  The first part was excellent; lots of suspense and interesting ""suggestions"", but it fell totally apart at the end (another government-conspiracy-malfunction thing.  *Yawn*).  Lou Diamond Phillips had a part in it, and it was the best thing I'd ever seen him do.  He played a Greenpeace warrior who lost his comrades when their boat sank in the Triangle.  Her gets back home, and finds out he has a second son he couldn't remember ever being born; then the truck he remembers as being blue is tan; and one of his friends who he saw drown at the Triangle shows up alive...  He starts freaking out; thinking he's going crazy.  He finally comes to decide that it must just be memory loss caused by the trauma of the boat sinking incident, and he tries to make of things.  Just as he's getting used to this new environment, he comes home to find that his second son doesn't exit again...  Then he comes home again another day and finds the house empty with a For Sale outside...  Now, he ready to kill himself because he doesn't understand what's going on.  Each ""environment"" was caused by a ""wave"" projected out of the Triangle (which is expanding).  It disrupts time and space, letting people slip from one multi-verse to another without realizing it at first... Because the first part and some of the twists and performances were good, I'm giving it a C+.  It would have got a higher grade, but the ""explanation"" of the Triangle and the ""re-pairing"" of it were stupid and thoroughly unoriginal."
576,5.0,"This has got to be the ultimate DVD box set.  Not only is every single filmed Apes project included (think about that for a moment, every single Apes project put to celluloid), not only are all the movies are anamorphic (squee), but it's all packaged in an authentic Ape head replica.  Maybe you gotta be geeky, but that's just freaking awesome!

I've displayed my Ape head in the living room for the time being and I get a kick out of the jumps and creeps it gives people.  Truly a set for the fans, completists and DVD collectors."
577,3.0,"I never thought I'd be able to say this, but Harry Potter has disappointed me.

I fully expected ""Goblet of Fire"" to surpass the first three films in the series. The books keep getting better and better, and so do the movies. I think ""Prisoners of Azkaban"" was the best of the first three Harry Potter movies, in spite of the fact that so much material had to be cut. Since the ""Goblet of Fire"" book is more than 700 pages long, I knew that a lot of the story would be lost in the movie version, and I was okay with that. I'm also aware that, at this point, the filmmakers are pretty much making these movies for people who are fans of J.K. Rowling's novels. A lot of things aren't explained in detail in the films: it is assumed that the audience has read the book and already knows what's going on. That was the case with ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" which left some people who hadn't read the book in the dark about some things.

I saw ""Goblet of Fire"" tonight with two people who have NOT read the book. They were confused by a number of things in the movie, which is totally understandable. I think the screenplay was pretty crappy overall. It's like the filmmakers didn't feel the need to explain ANYTHING, which was a bit ridiculous. It's one thing to assume that the audience knows enough about the book to figure out some things on their own, but it went overboard with this movie. I have a feeling that people who haven't read the book are going to leave the theatre feeling very shafted, and that might turn them off the Harry Potter series forever, which is a shame.

Let me get back to the details of the movie. A lot of things that were in the book had to be cut from the movie because there simply wasn't enough time to show everything. As a result, the filmmakers also had to take a few liberties with the script to compensate for a few things. For example, there were no house elves in the film at all, and therefore the whole incident where Winky uses Harry's wand to conjure the Dark Mark at the World Cup had to be rewritten. (Everything pretty much happened the same way as it does in the book, except we actually see Barty Crouch Jr. perform the spell at the start of the film...not a big deal.) It's always disappointing when such good book material has to be omitted from the film adaptation, but that's life. There's only so much material you can cram into two and a half hours, and overall I think the editors did a good job deciding what to delete from the film.

HOWEVER...this movie sucks on several other levels. It makes absolute sense that a lot of material from the book had to be cut from the movie, but why were so many other scenes added to the movie that weren't in the book? They were unnecessary and did nothing to enhance the film. In fact, all of those extra scenes could have been trashed in favor of including more original material from the book. Also, ""Goblet of Fire"" included a lot of what I call ""stupid humor,"" and once again, none of it was taken from Rowling's book. Why did Moody make the spider dance all over the students' faces? Why did Fred and George start rolling around on the floor fighting after they sprouted their beards? Why did they invent that stupid scene where Hermione has to play the part of monkey-in-the-middle messenger when Ron and Harry aren't speaking? Why did Moody stuff the ferret version of Draco Malfoy down another kid's pants? Why was Fleur practically eaten alive by the maze and Harry attacked by a bowl full of licorice? None of that made any sense to me.

There were other things that really bothered me, too. Why were all the girls decked out in fancy gowns at the Yule Ball when they were supposed to be wearing dress robes? How come Fleur and her Veela counterparts weren't all shimmery like they are in the books? All they did was do a stupid butterfly dance when they waltzed into the Great Hall for the first time. Also, what was up with the freaking ACROBATICS that the Durmstrang guys performed when they arrived at Hogwarts?! That DEFINITELY is not in the book! Why did Harry's dragon task turn into a ridiculous chase around the entire proximity of the school grounds? I cringed during the part where Harry got stuck on the ledge of the tower...why did they feel the need to do that? And is the poor dragon supposed to DIE at the end? That sucks! Why was Snape smacking Ron and Harry on their heads when they were talking during study hall? That was so ridiculous that I wanted to cry. Snape is a badass...he wouldn't tap the boys on the back of their heads like that! They practically turned Snape SOFT in this movie! (Come to think of it, Draco was kind of wussy this time around, too, and that's just not right. Would Draco Malfoy really be sitting up in a tree like that? Come on! That looked so lame.) And why did they make it look like Harry and Cedric were racing each other to the death in the maze to get to the Triwizard Cup? That's not how it happened in the book, and I see no good reason to change something like that. ARRRGH!

I wasn't thrilled with all the new additions to the cast, either. I really liked the kids who played Cho Chang and Cedric Diggory, and the guy who played Viktor Krum looked EXACTLY the way I have always pictured him when I read the book. Ralph Fiennes was excellent as Lord Voldemort, as I knew he would be. Miranda Richardson was perfectly cast as Rita Skeeter...it's unfortunate that she only had about five minutes of screen time. However, I was very disappointed with Brendan Gleeson's performance as MadEye Moody. He was too comical most of the time, and he needed to be a much darker, creepier character. (I hated the scene where he stuck his tongue out at Professor McGonagall...that was so wrong!) I didn't care for the actor who played Barty Crouch Jr., either. Oh well.

Please don't interpret this to mean that I absolutely hated the movie...that's not the case at all. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I really did enjoy it. There were a lot of scenes that were really good, and everything that happens after Harry and Cedric grab the portkey cup is phenomenal. (Then again, they totally ruined the end of the movie by ending it on a happy, uplifting note. Cedric is DEAD and Lord Voldemort is BACK, and yet all the students are giggling and chatting and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are chuckling about writing letters over the summer?! PLEASE! What a load of crap.)

Go see the movie. It was worth my $10...I was just expecting more, that's all."
578,1.0,"CT staggers through this film looking way out of shape, way unmatched to her black hair dye job, and REALLY freaking hard and used up, probably by drugs. The plot is obscure, the actiing stinks, and EVERY Single character is irritating as hell. The ""action"" scenes consist of nothing---extreme close ups of flickering moves---zilch, nothing, nada. This mess cannot hold a candle to the magnificence of ""Ultra Violet."" This was a total, utter, disgusting waste of my time. You should give it a miss. Really. Sincerely. It stinks."
579,3.0,"Back in the day...or if you prefer the Star Wars style intro ""a long time ago in a galaxy far far away"", MTV used to show almost nothing but music videos. Occasionally, they would put something incredibly progressive that was also quite popular (see Bevis and Butthead, for example). Aeon Flux was one such animated series.

The problem was, true to Asian style anime, the stories were so disjointed you had no freaking clue what the heck was going on. You just sort of sat back and watched and said ""cool"" a lot when something happened.

Flash forward to this movie, and you get the ""cool"" factor of old, and you finally get what the heck is going on in this world. Alas, the 'ho-hum' of the story makes it so you don't really even care. Check this out for the great special effects and enjoy the style and action. Pass if you're looking for a true nod to Aeon."
580,3.0,"I never missed an episode of DC doing S1-S4, but I stopped watching it as much after the fourth season. High School shows usually go downhill after HS and that's what happened to ""Dawson's Creek."" The gang went to college and the show lost it's appeal. Doing the original airing of S5-S6 I could not tell you what was happening because I barely watched it. I did watch the 2 hour series finale when it aired. I re watched S5 & S6 recently. Dawson is missed for a lot of S6 and that was all James' doing. When he is around, he's not hanging with the old gang. He spends a lot of his time with his director friend, Todd and his[Dawson] actress girlfriend. Since S2 I've always found a lot of the new characters they introduce for one season to be boring. C.J. is boring. Jensen 100x better on SPN. Eddie is boring. Emma is boring. I liked Audrey in S5, but in S6 she becomes very unlikable until the final episodes of the season. Dawson and Joey finally do the deed and it's unsexy and boring like the rest of their romantic relationship. They finally break up for good this season. After their one night stand, they're over once Joey finds out he had a girlfriend back in L.A. He broke up with his girlfriend over the answering machine before he slept with Joey. Dawson and Joey do not share many scenes together after the break up. Audrey and Pacey's relationship comes crashing down in S6. They were cute in S5, but I never believed they actually loved each other. It was more of a sex thing. Most of the episodes are pretty boring until Episode 14 ""Clean and Sober."" Pacey and Jack throw a house party and what a party it is! Pacey and Joey come back together in this episode. Then comes ""Castaways,"" TWT, SAV and LB. The show finally felt like DC again.  PJ break up in LB, but it's an awesome episode regardless. I will not call it a bad episode because of the ending. That's silly and so not me. LB and CA are two of the best episodes of the series. Carolla makes LL funny. C22 is good, but Pacey and Dawson have another big fall out because Pacey loses Dawson's money for his movie. Pacey comes clean in the next episode GBYBR. JPACR is a really nice episode leading us into the series finale. Joey gets everyone together to help raise money for Dawson's movie. Pacey goes out on his own and raises money for the movie. He then gives the money to Dawson. At the end Joey finally goes to freaking Paris, France! The 2 part series finale comes next and it's amazing. A beautiful way to end the show.

Best S6 episodes: Merry Mayhem, Clean & Sober, Castaways, That Was Then, Sex and Violence, Love Bites, Joey Potter and Capeside Redemption, All Good Things/Must Come to an End."
581,5.0,"Love stories about teenagers (although the people in this movie are more like...18, which still makes them a teenager but whatever) are usually pretty bad. In fact, almost all of them are. Rarely does a movie come around that really captures any of the emotion or raw angst of young love. Don't get me wrong, there are some...But few. This movie does that in it's own weird way. It's disturbing, haunting, beautiful, poignant, and true. And that's freaking talent, OK? Vincent Kartheiser ('Another Day in Paradise') plays Mason, a silent teenager who keeps to himself and watches his parents fight constantly and watch his uncle sink into an abyss probably caused by Vietnam. One day Mason meets Danny (Taryn Manning, 'Hustle & Flow') and it affects him. But then an accident takes Mason away for a couple years; when he returns, nothing is really different and Danny is still in town. She reveals to him that she's thought about him, the feeling's mutual and two begin to date. Add more some more tragedy and a wonderful semi-ending, you have ""Dandelion."" Since this won't give away anything, in the very beginning of the movie we're treated to an opening scene with Mason walking through a field before putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger. This scene works and yet it doesn't. It prepares you for the worst, but then in the next 15 minutes the scene is repeated twice giving us the feeling that Mason may be imagining it. It does work as a way of telling you ""This is not a happy-feel good movie."" But at the same time, it drops a few hints. Mason's killing himself? Something bad must happen...Could it be? Hmm. A lot of people may figure out the end, but that really doesn't matter. The last young love story I saw that was this good was ""All the Real Girls"" (although that film was far superior), even though both films are completely different while tackling almost the same subject matter. Although, for the record, there are no (even possibly imagined) suicides in ""All the Real Girls."" Anyway, that film definitely captured conversations, fascinations, and quirks about young love; and this film is definitely...Well, a movie. They both tackle the subject in an intelligent, poignant way. Some of the dialogue between Mason and Danny is a little too movieish, and Danny's character needed more screen time. But, and I know I'm repeating myself, this a beautiful film that deserves an audience.

GRADE: A"
582,5.0,"sure this is a freaking funny cartoon, great characters, plots and animation but what got me was a reference from the monarch accusing dr. girlfriend of hanging in a hot tub with james foetus. the music for this show is done by none other than j.g. thirwell, aka foetus, the industrial music mastermind himself. this proved to me that the venture brothers excels on all levels of creativity."
583,5.0,"I used to hate funimation for fouling up a great show as Dragon Ball and it many incarnations are, but I think they are beginning to make up for it. I paid for these same episodes eight years ago in a box set for 150 bucks, and these were edited and on tape. And they were missing a few episodes. So to buy the same episodes (my personal favorite part of dragon ball as a whole) for 30 bucks, uncut, with the option of japanese/subtitles, is freaking unbelieveable, and to tell a fan of the series up to ten years ago that you could get them the same episodes in crystal clear widescreen format dvd for a quarter of the price of less episodes on VHS, they'd soil themselves to some degree. I already have the set, bought it and so on, and for those worried about the widescreen thing, the episodes look good, and for people with widescreen TVs, prepare to be a-freakin-mazed. So, FUNIMATION, you finally are doing us right, but not after raping our wallets and purses clean for so many years. Keep it this way."

WrestleMania returns to Chicago for the third time in history under the theme of ""Big Time.""  A couple of notes here in that Michelle Williams from Destiny's Child sang the National Anthem & Jim Ross replaced Joey Styles as RAW lead commentator for the event with the exception of Styles calling the hardcore match later on in the show.

World Tag Team Champions Big Show & Kane vs. Carlito & Chris Masters - Kane & Show dominated early on with moves like Show easily tossing Carlito over the top rope onto Masters followed by Kane coming off the top rope onto both men with Carlito & Masters only gaining an advantage due to a mistimed move by show but it didn't last long with Kane & Show once again recovering & taking advantage of the miscalculation by Carlito & Masters.  This was pretty much a dominate showcase of Show & Kane as Carlito & Masters were never able to get a series of momentum throughout the match.

Rob Van Dam vs. Ric Flair vs. Matt Hardy vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Finlay vs. Shelton Benjamin - This match started off as a 6 way brawl between everyone & didn't stop with various highlights such as RVD's over the top dive onto Hardy & the ladder, Shelton using the ladder as a ramp for the running senton to the outside, Hardy's high suplex off the ladder, RVD's hard landing on the ladder after the Rolling Thunder, a triple powerbomb off the ladder, the showdown between veterans Flair & Finlay, Lashley showcasing his power, RVD's top rope dropkick with the chair, Hardy with a legdrop & side effect off the ladder, RVD's 5 Star Frog Splash off the ladder, and Shelton's showcase of athleticism throughout the match. The bar was pretty set high after the first one the previous year but they were able to match it here.
[Straight To The Top: Money In The Bank Anthology]

U.S. Champion Chris Benoit vs. J.B.L. - Both men started out trading fist before Benoit took him down with grounded wrestling & headbutts but J.B.L. was able to counter with a side headlock only for Benoit to reverse again pounding on his neck & head causing Jillian Hall to be used as a distraction for J.B.L. to land his own punches & kicks to the head as the match started to pick up with both men working over each other's heads such as Benoit's german suplexes & J.B.L.'s nerve hold & side chinlock while also getting very arrogant mocking Eddie Guerrero & his 3 amigos suplexes only for Benoit to perform his own version & countering J.B.L.'s own clothesline from hell into the crossface.  J.B.L. has mostly been known as a brawler but this was a match where Benoit brought out the best in him as far as straight wrestling with both men telling a story of working over the head & neck for this specific signature moves.

Hardcore Match: Mick Foley vs. Edge - Edge went on the offense right away using a cookie sheet & even executing a baseball slide into a road sign but it was when he attempted a spear that for some reason hurt himself more than Foley & causing his shoulder to bleed in the process as he revealed a strand of barbed wire wrapped around his waist underneath his flannel shirt. Foley continued to whip Edge across his bare back with the wire with Lita getting involved only for Foley to do his famous Cactus clothesline over the top rope with Lita on his back going over as well. They started to brawl on the outside with Foley thrown into the steps more than once & head whipped back onto the ramp before Foley own weapon of ""Barbie"" was used against him. Edge ended up taking more punishment of his own when he took a drop onto thumbtacks, a barbed wire ""Mr. Socko"" that Lita even felt the effects of, and ""Barbie"" resulting in Edge bleeding before he was able to give a spear to Foley that resulted in not only such a visual but also Mick Foley finally getting his ""WrestleMania Moment.""

Boogeyman vs. Booker T & Sharmell - We got a funny skit before the match with the freaks of wrestling from the past & present confronting Booker T but this was nothing past Boogeyman's usual act of eating words & freaking out his opponents with it which in this case was kissing Sharmell with a mouth full of worms in a match that was very short to the point where the backstage skit was more entertaining than anything that happened here.

Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James - Mickie game out the gate with a slap to with Trish responding with a Thesz Press takedown followed by punches & chops & a kick to the head only for Mickie to take advantage of a missed move to heavily work over Trish's leg using the ringpost & submissions like a half crab but Trish was starting to mount a comeback taking Mickie down many times with either a head scissors or clothesline or spinebuster & later a counter into a running powerbomb before Mickie still went after the leg & even using Trish's own moves against her like the head scissors & Chick Kick.  These two girls delivered a strong match with the ""bizarro world"" Chicago crowd playing a huge role & they chose their favorite & make it clear.

Casket Match: Undertaker vs. Mark Henry - Another Mania first in that this was the first casket match at the event. In a nutshell, Mark Henry was another limited big man so the match was a slow paced brawl as this was one of those cases where the stipulation definitely helped more than it would have been if they had a regular match. Nothing special here past the fact that this was the first casket match at Mania.

[Undertaker 15-0; Undertaker: The Streak]

No Holds Barred Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Mr. McMahon - Vince came into his match with an unbelievable tan (he looked like an Umpa Lumpa on steroids) showing off a portait of his ""Muscle & Fitness"" magazine cover at ringside before Shawn went right after him using the announce table & the equipment on it to his advantage along with the magazine cover not only resulting in Vince getting cut over his eye but also forcing him to call help in the Spirit Squad allowing Vince to take brief control whipping Shawn & having Shane get involved using a kendo stick only for Shawn to return it right back not only using the kendo stick on Vince & a handcuffed Shane but also put a new member into the ""Kiss My Ass Club"" as Shawn started to get more calculated & more violent with his actions going back to his past as a ""degenerate"" against Vince such as a loud direct chairshot & ladder to bust him open, using a table & trash can & a pulling out the highest ladder I've seen in WWE to land on Vince with impact, and making sure Vince saw Sweet Chin Music coming directly at his face.  This match wasn't the wrestling classic that Shawn has been known to deliver as ""Mr. WrestleMania"" as it wasn't designed to be that way more than just him being pushed to show off a very aggressive & violent side of him that we haven't seen in years while also having all the actions done to him for months by Vince come back to haunt him so in that light, this was a very entertaining match.

World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton - P.O.D. performed Rey Mysterio to the ring as Orton attacked Kurt with the belt right from the start with Angle responding with not only a german suplex on Orton but another one on him & Mysterio at the same time before giving an assist to Rey lifting him up in the air for a top rope frankensteiner allowing Rey to take control as he was able to roll through a sunset flip attempt into a knockout kick followed by a head scissor takeover however Angle was able to counter an attempted 6-1-9 attempt into the anklelock & later catching Orton in the anklelock with the referee distracted both times as he kept deliver impactful german suplexes & an Angle Slam that sent one challenger over the top rope only for each man to come back with a big move from Orton's RKO to Angle's top rope belly to belly suplex & Rey delivering a 6-1-9 around the ring post before it came down to come man being able to ""divide & conquer"" long enough to get the victory.  This was what a triple threat was designed to be in that it was non-stop action from all three men delivering one big move after another with each man looking like they had a chance but the major downfall of this (depending on how you want to look at it) is that this match was under 10 minutes when you would expect more from a World Championship match at WrestleMania.
[Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man; Top 50 Superstars]

Pillow Fight Match: Torrie Wilson vs. Candice Michelle - Former tag partners & Playboy cover girls met here with both girls wearing evening gowns while the ring was decorated with a bed & pillows in the center of the ring as Torrie actually executed some offense on Candice such a suplex, a backdrop onto the bed before turning it over & stomped on her on top of the mattress, and actually having her pet dog deliver the stinkface while Candice tried to choke her with a leg scissors across her head while she hung over the top rope.  This was what you would expect from these two as it was just an excuse to promote the WWE Playboy issue for the month (do any significant amount of people really order WrestleMania just to see the Playboy cover girl that they already see naked in the magazine?) with the girls eventually stripping down to their bra & panties with the only significant thing I noticed is that for what was advertised as a pillow fight, not one pillow was used.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Triple H - This match was similar to how the Hogan/Rock match at WrestleMania X8 was in that WWE had this match setup for one guy to be the babyface & the other the heel but the fans decided otherwise. It was during this period that John Cena was receiving a heavy amount of backlash by the fans as WWE Champion despite how much WWE was trying to force the audience to cheer for him (his previous Kurt Angle feud is a perfect example of that) which resulted in Triple H (who's no stranger to the audience disliking him for being shoved down their throats) being the lesser of two evils to the audience & came into this match as the fan favorite. As eluded to in the weeks building up to this event, Triple H took Cena very lightly & kept showing him up throughout the match...which would eventually come back to bite him as not only did the match end with the result that some people didn't expect but how it ended was in a way that even more people didn't expect. As a side note, pay attention to the ring entrances during this match as both of them came off as ""did they really think that would get over"" moments while if you pay close attention during Cena's entrance...you'll see a ""Straight Edge"" Chicago mobster.
[True Story Of WrestleMania]

(Bonus) RAW vs. SmackDown Battle Royal - This was the typical battle royal that only had a few standout moments such as ""My Name Is Simon Dean"", the noticeable dominance of Trevor Murdock, Viscera's treatment of MNM, and the crowd getting behind Chicago's own Road Warrior Animal.

Saturday Night's Main Event:
John Cena & Triple H vs. Kurt Angle, Rey Mysterio, Randy Orton - This was set to be a history making tag team match it's the first time that the WWE Champion teamed with his WrestleMania challenger to face the World Champion & his WrestleMania challengers (which WWE forgot about a year later when trying to advertise the No Way Out main event under the same conditions) as Angle & Rey some teamwork with Angle executing his suplexes on Cena & Triple H followed by Rey going high risk with the seated senton & taking both men with back to back dropkicks while Triple H did save Cena from an attempted 6-1-9 but caused tension with his partner when he got very aggressive with Rey on the outside tossing him into the barricade to the point where Cena refused to tag in out of protest before eventually tagging in to work over Orton but the tensions boiled over with one man turning on the other which Orton tried to take advantage of only for his teammates to make it clear they weren't going to accept the win like that.  This was an entertaining tag match perfectly telling the stories between not only the opponents but the uneasy alliance with the partners as well.

Trish Stratus & Mickie James vs. Victoria & Candice Michelle - This match was pretty much short & quick to the point where one of the participants was never even tagged into the match but this was more about what happened afterwords when Mickie James got emotional over how Trish reacted to her ""farewell.""

Street Fight Match: Shawn Michaels vs. Shane McMahon - Shawn started out attacking Shane from behind on the ramp down to ringside where he was able to reverse whip Shawn into the ring post before setting up a ladder in the ring while Vince setup a table on the outside only for both men to come off the ladder & crash through the table but Shane was able to recover using the ladder as a weapon against Shawn's back & delievering a chairshot with Vince getting involved whenever possible using a kendo stick against Shawn & causing distractions in favor of Shane but also ended up getting involved one too many times where it backfired when Shane went for the ""Coast To Coast"" with a trash can allowing Shawn to come back with his trademark maneuvers only for Vince to once again get Shawn to focus on him allowing Shane to take advantage & have a case of ""deja vu"" occur when he had Shawn in a certain submission hold.  This was a fun match.

587,4.0,"Un-freaking-believably, this is not the original Halloween re-released.  No, it's two DVDs worth of material from the 58 Halloween documentaries made since the film, including a totally new documentary, as well as new material, convention scenes from the Halloween convention (or one of them), more interviews, footage, interviews with the traffic cops who closed down the streets one day to shoot part of Halloween, more info, interviews, stuff, etc, etc, etc.

Too much material for most sane folk, but a treat for Halloween or Carpenter addicts (who obviously must have made this).  The new documentary is narrated by PJ Soles, of Halloween and Carrie and fandom fame, and a whole bunch of folks appear to talk about this seminal horror film.  We get some insight into the many sequels and some debate on the various masks used (is it that hard to recreate the low-budget mask of the first two?)

Again, recommended for addicts, of course.  Others may want to pick up one of the 127 or so versions of the film itself released on VHS, Laserdisc, DVD, Blu Ray, and wax cylinder over the years."
588,5.0,"Samurai Shamploo suprised me, I honestly wasn't expecting much from this anime but I was so wrong to think that. This anime is now on my top 15 anime, the whole series was a blast and the last 3 episodes were just freaking amazing."
589,5.0,"I guess I was extremely spoiled by Season 1 (see my review there), waiting all those years to find that once the show had returned, it was back with a spine tingling, take your breath away with excitement, jump out of your seat in disbelief of such glorious scripts and performances, absolute freaking vengeance.  Now, onto series 2, I was in no doubt looking and expecting nearly the same, albeit with a different actor at the helm.  This was nothing different for Who fans, and with some slim exceptions, it all worked out well.

I know some of you say we can't compare this and series one, or this and that, but hey, it's what Who fans have been doing throughout time.  I firmly believed that as an entire season, last seasons series 1 of the new show ranked up there as possibly the best full run of episodes in Who's full run.  Having to follow that would be a true test indeed, and while I thought season 2 was very enjoyable, it wasn't quite as strong as 1.

There was evidence even in the promising first episode, The Christmas Invasion, that there was some little je ne sais quoi that I couldn't quite put a finger on, that made is ever so slightly down a notch from the high impact of season 1's shows.  There was further evidence when it came to season 2's first real episode, New Earth, as it muddled along without a whole lot of excitement to take in.

Thankfully, after the very good reunion of The Doctor, Sarah Jane, & K9, the show seemed to keep creeping up and up in excitement quality, until the brilliant season finale two parter.  In fact, this two part mind blowing season finish, was probably the first time I had felt as ecstatic as I did watching the entire first series episodes.

I was displeased that the second season never felt as unique as series 1, but nonetheless still had fun watching yet another strong run of episodes in Who's continuing history.  After thinking about it more and more, I came to the realization that it was less David Tennant vs. Eccleston that made the two series different, and more about the strong writing of series 1 compared to the medoicre scripts of season 2.  Season 1 just had more snappy dialogue for the doctor, more impactful events tightly woven into the 50 minute episodes, and overall better stories.

That's not to say this season didn't have it's share of goodies, including one of my favorites, Idiot's Lantern, dealing with supernatural events in the 1950's, and leading into the very spooky two parter, The Impossible Planet, and the Satan Pit.  It's just I couldn't help but think when I watched season 1, that this was hands down the best show on TV, the best sci-fi episodes on TV, and the best Who in a long time.  With season 2, I can't safely say that I enjoyed it better than say a season of The Dead Zone, Stargate, or Stargate Atlantis, but I can say it's a very enjoyable piece of sci fi and another superb addition to the Who Universe.  I just wish the scripts were tighter and flowed better.

On to David Tennant.  It took me a few episodes, for me to take a liking to him, but quickly found that he is just as quirky a Doc as any predecessor and deserves his worthy place among the rest.  He can bring his serious side out just as quickly and believable as his distinct, flamboyant one.  I think having him a second season will be a welcome event, after having Eccleston for one short one.  Hopefully, they will get the writing a little more up to snuff, and the excitement level, so I can once again, safely say there is nothing better on TV than Who.  For right now, I can't, but it's still an excellent season of Who, a smooth transition into a new Doctor, and left at a point where this new, yet old, franchise can continue to grow.  Here's looking toward season 3 ..."
590,5.0,"To start things off, seeing Milla in Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocolypse impressed me to no end. She's like a modern day Sigourney Weaver, showing her tough as nails passion in action/sci fi flicks and Ultraviolet is all Jovovich.

Similar to Matrix/Elektra/Aeon Flux style, the story is about the battle between humans and a new race with genetic mutation. Pretty cliche, but when you see how it's pulled off you'll adore it. The action is pretty good, with lots of shoot outs and swordfighting, more realistic and awesome seeing Milla with a sword than let's say- Uma Thurman. Oh and when you see the way she carries all those weapons with her, you're gonna say ""that's freaking clever!"" The CGI cities and effects are pretty good, but there are scenes where it's overdone. Sure there's more action than story, but this type of Jovovich movie gets people ready for the next Resident Evil.

Since Resident Evil, Milla never let her crowd down. She's one of the best female action stars in history and hope she continues her beat down on the big screen in the near future. This chick has a future ahead of her."
591,3.0,"We would've given this a higher rating, but the freaky bugs, george washington chickens, punk ox, the can-can birds, the dog and the bird (Jacquapo, and if that's not how you spell his name I couldn't care less). Cornelius could really lose the cowlick and thumbelina's weird bang thing could use an adjustment. Their romance blossomed very quickly. The only songs we liked ""Let me be your wings"" and ""marry the mole!"" THe mouse was so cute, but the mole was really freaking us out.
And Thumbelina's hairdo at the end could change. But the best character has to be the pink-haired frog. ANd the beetle. Though i must say, the frog who wants to marry Thumbelina made up his mind quicker than Cornelius (which is saying something). Just two seconds, and he says ""Mother...I love her"" (even though I don't know anything about her).
Disney could have made it better.
We know and understand that this review probably wasn't the best or most convincing one, but we felt like writing it anyway."
592,4.0,"WARNING: The review you are about to read will give Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare a great deal of praise. However this film should not be construed as good, interesting, or scary in any sense imaginable. So if you are seeking a legitimate horror movie then turn around and run screaming 'he's gone, the evils gone from here!"" as this will not be your cup of tea. Now that we have been clear on this matter let us just say that Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare was a stroke of B genius. It's almost as if the song Shout at the Devil was transposed into a film. Except it would be like a really horrific cover band's version with Vince Niel's brother Vance Niel at the helm. The level of confusion was elevated to new heights that only the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Games/dp/B0002VEWR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Games</a>&nbsp;could possible comprehend. The only difference was a whole lot more mullets, horrible 80's rock, and a lead singer that looked like a David Lee Roth impersonator. Oh and we can't forget the hand puppets...yeah there were actual hand puppets.

Rock 'n' Roll nightmare wastes no time in the confusion department, being that within a couple minutes you have no idea what is going on. Apparently a family gets killed in an old farmhouse by something evil and a skeleton head comes screaming out of the oven. After that the camera follows a van driving on the road for a straight ten minutes. God forbid you're watching this high because you'd fully be freaking out at this point. Once the van finally arrives at this old farmhouse our band of misfits come stumbling out to deliver one of the most awkward scenes in movie history. Every actor butchered their lines stuttering and all. The drummer was our favorite. This guys had the WORST Australian accent that he would drift in and out of throughout the entire film. So turns out they're at this farmhouse to record some new tunes and fall prey to a punch of hand puppets from the darkside. The puppets somehow kill them one by one, take the murdered humans form, and strut around the house as if nothing happened. In the end turns out the lead singer is actually an angel that tricked the devil to show up at this farmhouse and....uh forget it. It's honestly too confusing too attempt to explain.

Rock 'n' Roll nightmare may offer nothing to the conventional movie watcher, but delivers an inordinate amount of laughs for the B lover. It is honestly one of the worst film's that has ever been created in the best way possible. It's worth the watch just to see this super fruity 80's band led by the David Lee Roth impersonator with his leopard blazer. Watching them record music in the studio was something every person should witness at least once in their lives.  The onscreen chemistry between this band was obviously something the world was lucky to have caught on film. The devil may have been the highlight of the evening. This thing couldn't have taken more then 15 minutes to whip up and looks exactly like creature on the cover. Really something MST3K should have done years ago. We implore you to get in touch with your inner mullet this Halloween and cue up a film that makes 80's hair metal look even worse."
593,5.0,"It's Lost, an amazing show. When the show first aired I had never heard of it. It wasn't until season 2 or three that my brother told me about it. His birthday was coming up so I bought season one for him on DVD. His birthday was a month away so I decided to pop in a disc to check it out. I had to make sure the dvd's played didn't I? Tee Hee.

So within seconds I was hooked, and before I knew it I was done with the whole season. Great casting, great story, amazing location, it felt like watching a really long, really good movie.

The only downside I ever felt toward the show was the story of Michael and his son Walt. For two damn seasons all we see is this idiot running around yelling Walt! I swear the only lines that guy had was Walt, WALT WALT WALT WHERES MY SON. I GOTTA GET MY SON WALT. So freaking annoying!! Besides that, the show is a blast."
594,5.0,"Curse on HBO for dropping this series after only one season!  Lisa Kudrow shines in this faux-reality show about a once famous actress desperately trying to find the spotlight again.  Valerie Cherish is a tense woman who's very aware of the cameras on her almost all of the time.  She's wants people to believe she's cool, calm and collected but most of the time she's freaking out about something ridiculous.  All of that said, you cant help but love her and want to see her succeed.

Kudrow in the role as Valerie is NOTHING like her role as Phoebe in Friends.  This only serves to show the woman's comedic (and in some cases, dramatic) range.  She makes Valerie Cherish feel like a real person and most of the time, its hard to imagine that Cherish and Phoebe were both played by the same woman.

The show itself is very funny and centers mainly on Valerie Cherish's acting comeback as she works playing a ridiculous older-woman-ish character on a sitcom.

Definitely worth owning!"
595,5.0,"I didn't watch Carnivale when it was aired nor had i heard of it at the time. until my friend let me borrow it a few years ago and i fell in love with it. And thats where my eye candy obsession for Nick Stahl appeared!! Also Clancy Brown is just freaking awesome, in whatever role he does he just goes for it and you really believe in it. NO ONE else could have done his role in Carnivale not at all!
The first season was the best and the second season did gave so much answers to the questions but they knew they were cancelling and so it all was just rushed. Its a shame that it ended it was a great story/plot/whatever but than again it makes sense that they didn't let it continue cuz of other producers and writers tastes and blah blah but if you think about it, how can this kind of story about good and bad really end?? there is no ending and will never will be and I think thats what they were getting at with the ending as well.  It was a shame i would have loved to see a movie or a mini series of this come up just to keep us Carnivale fans going and to let other people go, i have to see the Seasons now!!"
596,5.0,"It is about time we got to see a season two!  Now all I have to ask is do we really have to wait another four years for season three, four, and so on????

I still find this one of the best shows that t.v. has ever seen and cannot believe that it is taking so freaking long to make it's whole arrival!

It's time to bring on more!!!  (Yep, I'm a fan!)"
597,4.0,"This is a very good bundle for a very generous price, and is actually a much better set than the Zombie Vol. 1 pack. Media Blasters quality really is second to none (probably on par with Blue Underground) and their tendency to release three movies for less than the price on one is something I think people should be enthusiastic about.

So far as the movies are concerned, we aren't talking Citizen Kane, obviously, but they're certainly fun for what they are, and well worth watching. The strong point of the set is Zombie Holocaust/Doctor Butcher M.D., which is a pretty good Italian style jungle romp, and the low point is the staggeringly awful Flesheater, which drags on for-freaking-ever. Regardless, these are all plenty of fun, and the price is right. If you're more than a casual fan of the genre, this is worth the money."
598,4.0,"School can be hell. So it's a perfect spot for horror movies that focus on the symbolic supernatural problems of teenagers.

In the case of the superb ""Whispering Corridors"", the setting is a Korean girls' school. While the finale is a bit drippy (literally), director Park Ki-Yong never resorts to gore or cheap scares -- just a lot of creepy visuals, shocking attacks, and a double twist ending that you won't see coming.

As the movie opens, tyrannical Mrs. Park (Jin-hie Park) is making a call to the youngest (and pleasantest) teacher, Eun-Young (Mi-yeon Lee) -- about Eun-Young's best friend Jin-Ju, who died nine years ago. Then she's yanked up by an invisible force, and is found hanged by students the next morning. Eun-Young is left to ponder Park's final words: ""She never left.""

Soon gruesome events become more commonplace -- student Ji-oh (Gyu-ri Kim) notices a strange bloodstain over her desk, photos are altered, and the student-molesting Mad Dog is savagely murdered. Eun-Young starts sifting through clues -- and the abandoned art shed where Jin-Ju died -- to figure out where the ghost will strike next. But Jin-Ju is far closer than anyone has suspected...

""Whispering Corridors"" isn't really a horror movie as much as a ghost movie -- it prefers to creep you out, rather than freak you out. In fact, most of the horror comes from how the students are treated by the callous teachers, to the point where it's hard to get TOO upset when Jin-Ju kills the people who tormented her in life.

That seems to have been Park Ki-Yong's intention, but she doesn't neglect the ghost angle. There are plenty of creepy moments here -- creaky floors, quiet corridors, a man being murdered by a curtain, or a painting of a bloody dead woman. What's more, Park can disturb us on a deeper level, such as the frenzied flashbacks to poor Jin-Ju being bullied to death.

For all the quiet scariness, there are moments of rapid, brutal violence as well (Mad Dog being strangled and bashed into a window). The only weak spot: the final confrontation with Jin-Ju seems weirdly soppy.

This is very much a character-driven movie, and the actors do wonderful jobs: Mi-yeon Lee as the bright-eyed Eun-Young, who is haunted by guilt over her best friend's unhappy life and tragic death, and Gyu-ri Kim as a current student who resembles Eun-Young during her younger days. The girl who plays Ji-oh's shy pal does an excellent job as well.

""Whispering Corridors"" is a rare type of ghost story -- slow, eerie, and prefers to haunt you instead of freaking you out. Definitely a must-see."
599,3.0,"Alright. Mick Garris has made mistakes. Aka: Masters Of Horror- Chocolate.

But we all do. It makes us human. I understand this.

Now, what I can't understand is how you can take a very good premise ( I mean that ape guy in Alien Res as a crazy cop- the best man! the freaking best! Tak!)and culminate it into a dissapointing and frankly annoying ending.

This movie could have been a masterpiece.

It took Stephen kings character based saga and ran with it.

The use of desert creatures as soldiers in the army of evil was a smart move, and even the redemption on the part of Tom skerrit rang somewhat true. The child actor was annoying as most are and the lead was quite good as he usually is- check out the TV Shining movie.

I guess in the end what did this effort in was essentially the end.

As in other reviews on Amazon, I have shown my displeasure of not exposing the titular creature. I mean, here we go through the whole movie, hearing about this TAK fella and do we even catch a glimpse of this demi-god or demon or whatever..no.

This is my main complaint..the excellent beginning...the creature kills..the not made for TV dead bodies everywhere..all should have led up to the final confrontation with this antithesis of good. But what do we get instead, some kind of Rodney Dangerfield..I get no respect type dialogue between the good guy and the bad guy..with the good guy muttering to a hole in the ground that is supposed to represent the beast.

Give me a break.

Since when do the movie going public deserve fodder as a climax to a otherwise smooth and charming film.

Why..oh why can't we all just agree on a common theme.

If your gonna cop out at the end..just don't make the movie.

So in conclusion, if you were to watch the movie halfway through and be interrupted and unable to complete its viewing you would say"" Wow. What a great show!""

However, if you made it through to the end, you would be left seriously wanting.

You would say ""I sure wish they would make 'em like the old days.""

But what do I know.

600,5.0,"Bandai has been releasing its series in Boxed Sets, but half series for the longer ones (50 episode) in two boxes sold separately.  This is for the second half of the series.

The first time I saw the finale (NO SPOILERS!) I almost threw the DVD across the room.  Upon viewing this series a second time I come to understand the deep and meaningful message of this show: Good cannot exist without Evil and vice versa.

Without giving away the plot or spoilers, this show continues to excel well into the second half.  The final three episodes are heart wrenching but the ending will still give you a lift (second time for me though!)

This is surely one of the better series produced in recent history and the animation, story, and acting are all top quality.  Yoko Kanno wrote the soundtrack which, like all of her work, fits the story perfectly.

Dai Sato is one of the best anime creators and screenwriters.  He has so far been one of the better writers in this style and genre.

If you like this, also check out Ergo Proxy (though the animation suffers in that show, damn Korean outsourcing), Last Exile (freaking amazing series), or Witch Hunter Robin.  DO NOT be fooled into watching Gilgamesh, it steals so obviously from this plot, just without the wolves...

Pros: Animation, acting, story, one of the creepiest villains EVER
Cons: Disgustingly sad ending

Viewing Preference: English Dub (though it was a close one)"
601,4.0,"We watched a double feature of DREAMLAND and THE LAKE HOUSE with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, and afterwards realized they were essentially the same picture, only THE LAKE HOUSE had storyboards.

What happened to Megan shouldn't have happened to a dog.  She's dead broke, out of a job, and her boyfriend won't even properly maintain this big old showboat cruiser with an enormous gas tank.  So that when Megan and Dylan decide to visit friends in Nevada, somewhere between Reno and Vegas, the car stops dead on the middle of the highway, in a spooky, surreal nightime landscape tinged with blue horizons and mesquite trees, and not much else.  The desert whispers to them, calling their name, which would really freak me out, and the only place to get something to eat is the real life ""LITTLE ALE INN,"" a 40s style roadhouse with right wing bumper stickers plastered all over its walls and every shelf in the joint.  There, they are greeted by an eerie, tobacco-spitting barman played by Jonathan Breck from the Jeepers Creepers movies.

They realize they have somehow stumbled into Area 51 home of alien crash landings and government cover-up, and the so-called ""Black Mailbox"" (which also plays a substantial part in THE LAKE HOUSE, for Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock each live in the same house in different years, and can only communicate with each other through leaving notes in the mailbox.  Stick its little red flag up, and you'll see it come down as thoug invisible hands had retrieved the note you put in it.  Eerie!)  Anyhow in DREAMLANDS the main girl, Megan, is played by an actress with less charisma than Sandra Bullock, and also the cinematographers have given her shiny bright blue eyes, like a china doll, whenever she gets stressed.  Which, in DREAMLANDS, in 90 per cent of the movie.

I liked Dylan, as the boyfriend, until a certain point in the picture when it seems almost as though he had become somebody else and his eyes grow bright blue and opaque, like the jewels of the Nile!  Though neither star has much acting ability, teamed together they have real nuclear chemistry, and I hope to see them again in pictures with considerably bigger budgets than DREAMLAND.  Poor Megan only had one outfit through the whole picture!  (Except for flashbacks to when she was a little girl.)  No wonder she was freaking out."
602,5.0,"I purchased the double feature of these movies but the 1st movie didn't look like a blu-ray movie at all, so freaking grainy. Is the picture quality of this blu-ray version better? If so i'll buy this one & use the other one as a coaster!"

604,2.0,"Not scary, not interesting, nothing original, no plot, half-baked, actors have no enthusiasm, just a real boring movie.

With 20 minutes left I couldn't take it anymore and bailed.

THE GRUDGE was a scary freaking film No comparison."
605,1.0,"Okay for those who don't know this is not the movie directed by Brian De Palma, it is actually a rip off directed by Ulli Lomell. Ulli Lomell is a German director who has done only one so-so movie called Boogeyman(1980) (not to be confused with the 2005 version) anyway this director is doing a movie every freaking month, and they are all horrendous. Like this one they all have bad acting, bad dialogue, bad lighting, etc. . . . The story centers around some sickos who are reenacting the murder of Betty Short (Black Dahlia) again and again more murders in the same fashion begin to occur, it becomes so repetitive that you literally have to fast forward. Also the movies production is so cheap, I think even someone with no experience and no money would do a better job. The director even makes the movie worse than what it already is by inserting ""SAW"" like transitions every second; it gets really irritating. And not to mention the ending which made no sense whatsoever. PLEASE don't watch this for the curiosity to see if it is as bad as everyone thinks because it actually is as bad. Definitely avoid at all costs.

MY PERSONAL RATING: 0 OUT OF 5"
606,4.0,"For this horror fan's money, Rest Stop is a gritty, gory thrill ride well worth watching.  Yes, the story has some problems, but I really don't understand all the vitriol directed toward this juicy little film.  You have to respect a killer who has honed his craft to such an exquisite degree as the Rest Stop killer; this guy has psychological and physical torture down to a freaking science, savoring every minute of the heroine's extended ordeal.  He repeatedly leaves the scene entirely, confident that his prey remains under his complete control in each of his absences.  Admittedly, the fact that our poor dumb heroine isn't exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer helps, but I still have to give major kudos to our bad guy.  I don't think I've ever characterized a killer as having panache, but this guy has it in spades.  I don't care how unoriginal and sometimes clichd the movie was, I quite enjoyed it.  Still, the critics have some valid points.  The addition of a certain family into the story was an embarrassingly bad decision that comes across as shameless pandering, while certain potentially confusing elements in the plot will be decried as serious plot holes by some - although I think their inclusion and lack of a definitive explanation actually add an effective depth to the story.  Those who expect their horror movies to wrap everything up with a Scooby Doo ending won't like it, but I see no reason why a horror film can't leave you pondering over a few unanswered questions.

The basic storyline is pretty simple.  Young Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander) runs off to California with her boyfriend Jess (Joey Mendicino) - but they never make it.  At some point along the way, Nicole's need to relieve herself lands them both at the world's nastiest and most remote rest stop.  Showing great fortitude, Nicole actually manages to do her business inside, but there is no Jess and no car waiting for her when she comes back out.  As the hours and minutes pass, her wonder and bafflement at Jess turn into deep concern, and then her worst fears seem to be confirmed by the menacing presence of a mysterious man in an old yellow truck - the same man and truck referenced on a number of ominous graffiti posts (going back a number of years) on the bathroom stalls.  Nicole's night takes on a number of macabre, borderline insane twists and turns, but the one overwhelming constant is the killer's murderously calculated intent to torment this poor girl.

At one point, Nicole does interact with the world's weirdest family inside an RV, and the movie suffers greatly for the inclusion of this scene.  It's patently ridiculous and really disrupts the tension and suspense the movie has the built up until that point.  It's most unfortunate because Nicole's interaction with a couple of other characters during her ordeal plays so well.  I have to take a moment here and praise Joey Lawrence for his performance; I never knew he could act, but I thought he was great in this movie.  It also behooves me to say a few words about the DVD extras.  In general, it is never a good thing for a movie to come with alternate endings, let alone three of them, because their presence on the DVD necessarily conveys the impression that the director was never quite sure how to end the movie.  We can at least take comfort in the fact that he chose the best of the available endings for the film itself, as none of the three alternate endings works well at all, in my opinion.  Personally, I would not have included them on the DVD.  Other extras include a slideshow of ""crime scene"" shots as well as a home movie made by a member of the RV family.  Apparently, this little film may have a bearing on some of the film's open questions, but it's really more stupid than anything else.

In the end, we do have a flawed, unoriginal, clichd movie - yet I think it works surprisingly well despite these handicaps.  Obviously, a significant number of viewers disagree with me on this.  I would just ask you not to dismiss this film out of hand because of all the negative reviews.  While you've no doubt seen this type of storyline play out before in other horror movies, Rest Stop does succeed in invoking an atmosphere all its own.  It's not scary, but I certainly had a good time watching it."
607,5.0,"When SOUTH PARK first hit the airwaves a decade ago, I had no desire to watch the show.  At the time, from those I talked to the show just didn't sound like something I would enjoy.  Over time my tastes have changed a bit and after having heard a few months ago about a lesson taught about the educational benefits of SOUTH PARK, I decided to watch an episode on television.  I watched one and I was hooked.  I wanted to become more acquainted with the series without yet buying a complete season and therefore was able to get my hands on this DVD collection, SOUTH PARK--THE HITS:  VOLUME 1.

For those who are already familiar with the show, this DVD collection is will probably be redundant because all of the episodes in this set are now available in each one of the season's collections.  The only reason a serious fan might be interested in owning this set is that it includes the short ""The Spirit of Christmas"" which started the series.  That short pilot is available on the Internet, but if I'm not mistaken this is the first time it's available on DVD.  That short has Jesus and Santa Clause fighting each other over who will control Christmas.

Though this DVD collection probably won't hold much appeal for series fans, it is a great collection to introduce someone to the series.  There are ten episodes selected by Matt Stone and Trey Parker.  Each of these episodes includes a brief commentary by Stone and Parker.  In addition, there are four bonus episodes and ""The Spirit of Christmas"" short.  As Stone and Parker point out on the commentary to ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset"" they had a difficult time coming up with ten episodes that were their ""favorites"" because they tend to view the newest episode as being their favorite one.  However, the collection does include at least three episodes that seem to be their favorites as well as some episodes that were landmark episodes in the series.

My favorites in the collection include:

""The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers""--Cartman, Kyle, Stan, are sent to take a video from Stan's parents to Butter's parents.  The video is supposed to be ""The Lord of the Rings"" but turns out to be a very hot, and in some states illegal, adult tape.  Cartman, Kyle, and Stan do not know this.  But everywhere they go people start freaking out when they come in contact with the tape.  So, they leave on an epic journey to return to the tape to the video store two towns away.  This episode is both a great homage to ""The Lord of the Rings"" as well as just being a show about the kids just being kids (with a little bit of twisted humor thrown in).

""Best Friends Forever""--Kenny is one of the few lucky kids in South Park to get a PSP when they first arrive in stores.  He finally finds something he is good at when he begins playing a war game called, ""Heaven Vs. Hell"".  Kenny reaches level 60, the highest level in the game.  While celebrating, he is killed.  It turns out the Satan is planning on invading Heaven.  God has a plan though and created PSP and used the game ""Heaven Vs. Hell"" as a way to find a person who would be able to lead the armies of Heaven versus Satan's forces (THE LAST STARFIGHTER anyone?).  Kenny is that person, but just as the battle is about to begin, Kenny disappears.  Even though he is mentally a vegetable, his body is being kept alive through machines.  Cartman wants Kenny to die so that he can get his PSP, but Kyle and Stan think that's just wrong.  Cartman thinks he has the power to pull the plug because he and Kenny were BFF's.  Thus, a huge national legal battle drenched in media coverage begins.  This episode won an Emmy.

""Good Times With Weapons""--Cartman, Kyle, Stan, and Kenny purchase real ninja weapons at a local carnival.  They pretend to be ninjas, get in a fight with Butters, and end up going on a journey to return the weapons so they won't get in trouble.  The anime style of animation when the kids imagine themselves as ninja warriors is great and the theme song from this episode, ""Let's Fighting Love"" is a great parody of Japanese pop music.

""Casa Bonita""--Kyle is having a birthday party at the best Mexican restaurant in the world, Casa Bonita.  The place has great food, cliff divers, Blackbeard's cave, and a place where you can get your photo taken as an outlaw in jail.  Stan and Kenny are invited, but Cartman isn't.  Kyle can only invite three people and since Butters invited him to his birthday party, he's just returning the favor.  Cartman is furious, but cooks up an unbelievable scheme to get Butters out of the way just so he can go in his place.

""Trapped in the Closet""--this is the episode that has probably received more attention than any other in the South Park collection.  The show has Stan joining the Church of Scientology.  The people in the church believe Stan is the reincarnation of Ron L. Hubbard.  The media surrounds Stan's house and Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and R. Kelly end up living in Stan's closet because Stan doesn't like TomCruise's acting very much.  Paramount had the episode pulled from syndication before the release of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE III.  The episode is hilarious, but isn't that different from many other SOUTH PARK episodes.  If it wasn't for the controversy surrounding it, it probably wouldn't be a part of this collection.

""Scott Tenorman Must Die""--Cartman has a trick played on him by an older student, Scott Tenorman.  Cartman attempts several times to get revenge, but is embarrassed further each time by Tenorman.  Stan and Kyle tell him over and over to just let it go, but he can't.  He then sets into motion a plan for revenge reminiscent of something from TITUS ANDRONICUS.

Overall, SOUTH PARK THE HITS: VOLUME 1 is a collection that major fans of the series will find redundant, but is a great set of episodes to introduce someone to the series."
608,5.0,"This show is so freaking awesome! I love seeing this side of Gene Simmons. It definitely shows the normal, private, intimate side that we never get to see. Plus it's hilarious with all the teasing that he gets from Nick and Shannon especially!"
609,1.0,"Sweet Lord in Heaven, this movie is awful.  The Asylum has released more than its share of bad movies, but Snakes on a Train may well be the worst of the lot.  You could argue that Snakes on a Plane (which I actually enjoyed) was itself a B-movie, so this Asylum knockoff is C-grade at best.  There is not one single thing positive I can say about this cinematic disaster.  The script is terrible, the acting is annoyingly bad, and the special effects are unbelievably, embarrassingly pitiful.  I also must point out that the DVD cover contains blatant lies: there aren't anywhere close to 3,000 snakes in this movie - more like a few dozen - and the entire cast can't include more than 20 people (certainly not ""100 trapped passengers"").  That ""trapped"" business is a hard sell, anyway, because you can jump off a moving train and survive.  Some of these characters, though, are afraid to jump down from the train when it isn't even moving because ""it's too far!""  Really?  What is it - two feet down at the most?  Give me a freaking break.

So how do these snakes get on the train to begin with?  Well, some Mexican girl ran off with her boyfriend rather than marrying the high-class fellow her family had picked out for her, so someone in that family cursed her.  Now she has gobs of snakes slithering around inside her body - and she keeps puking them up.  That's actually a bad thing because the snakes are a part of her now and she can't live without them.  Thanks to this ridiculous storyline, we're forced to watch scene after scene of her medicine man boyfriend chanting some kind of hoodoo voodoo stuff.  It just keeps going on and on and on, even though it's obvious that these ""spells"" aren't working.  The other thing about these snakes is that they seem to grow exponentially in size after they're barfed up, so it's only a matter of time before the other people on the train are being attacked by horrible CGI effects.  There's a subplot or two among the other passengers, but who really cares?  I didn't give two spits in the ocean about anybody in this movie.

You will think this movie is terrible as you watch it progress, but only those who suffer through to the very end will know the true depth of its awfulness.  This one goes down hard, people - I suggest you give Snakes On a Train a very wide berth."
610,4.0,"Fine - okay - there, deleted...

What's funny, and ironic as heck - is that for all my ""whining"" you all complained about --- that's all your comments were!  Whining about my ""whining"".

I wasn't even whining! -- obviously, you didn't read closely enough, and between the lines.  I was putting forth questions, ideas, and answering some questions of previous reviewers.

The fact that what I, or anyone else says in these reviews - is taken SO seriously by some of you, is actually frightening!  These are our opinions, we're entitled to them -- and quite honestly, I fought for the right to defend them!

What everyone FAILED to realize (except a small few) was that I was griping about how THE NETWORK decided to divide the series --- and WONDERED, if that would coninue - just to make a buck... THAT'S ALL.  (stating that they don't do it for other shows -- especially shows with fans / fanbases no where near as strong as that of Family Guy).

All you who left comments to my (original) review need to get a freaking life!  Grow up, and certainly don't say ""I want the 3 minutes of my life back you stole"" -- and then waste 5 more minutes, telling me about it!  DUH!"
611,2.0,"Since the greatest crime one could commit (according to Bukowski) was to waste his freaking time, this film is something of a curse.

It's pretty lousy film making. If you're going to make a book out of something like FACTOTUM, you should at least be able to create something far more effective than this. While Dillon was really, really good in his portrayal of Bukowski, the rest of the movie is something of a train wreck. You never know where you're standing if you're unfamiliar with Buk's writing, and one feels completely let down if you are an admirer of the vast spread of Charles Bukowski's stories, novels, essay, and poems.

Don't waste your time. There are plenty of better things to read and view."
612,3.0,"It freaking hurts. After about the millionth time that it was time for another ""hill,"" I thought that I might die. I haven't put this thing in since the first time I watched it. Good luck with this one. Definitely not for somebody who hasn't worked out before. I'm in pretty good shape and I may never attempt this again."
613,5.0,"Okay, I ddin't actually pee my pants, but I almost did.

This is the funniest movie I have seen in years! I know I was missing a lot of the inside jokes because I don't watch a lot of cop movies (haven't ever seen Bad Boys 2, been years since I saw Point Break) and even though I watch a ton of british comedies, I know some of that stuff still eluded me due to language differences. But even with all that, I was laughing nearly the entire way through.

The editing for this movie is insanely good. Simon's movies always have the best transitions, something I think that transfered over from his Spaced days. (MINOR SPOILERS) For example, the part where the cloaked murderer beats the guy in the face with a baton transitions smoothly into Sgt. Angel falling into his chair to watch the movie. So genious! these little things are what make a good movie into a great one. It's that attention to detail in every part of this movie that shows the love the creators have in their work. When someone loves what they are creating this much, then the audience is bound to as well.

Characters are vivid and memorable, but there are just too many to keep them all straight with one viewing. Good excuse for me to watch this over and over. Awesome performances by all, esp. Timothy Dalton, Nick and Simon.

This movie is kind of a comedy/action/slasher hybrid. It does a fairly good job of balancing all these elements, though comedy seems to be the thread that ties them all together. There isn't much action for the first part of the movie, just comedy. Then the slasher mystery starts, and then the action. At first, I was really put off by the switch in tone from light comedy to slasher movie, as there wasn't much setup for this in the beginning. This is really the only thing I can find wrong with the movie. The good news is they do a good job of establishing the slasher portion and the disorientation from the switch in tone (a problem they also had with Shaun) wears off. The movie closes with perhaps the best and most satisfying ending to any action movie I have ever seen. I was fist-pumping with joy and shouts of ""yes!"" the entire time (hangs head in embarrasment). It has everything! A big scooby-doo reveal, a reversal, massive gun battle (think John Woo), a car chase, a hand-to-hand fight, and an ""explosive"" finale. If at any point you were unconvinced that they weren't taking themselves seriously, the ending will safely do away with that notion, heh hehh.

Pegg throws in every cop movie cliche and then some, plenty of tongue-in-cheek humor, campy action sequences, and brilliantly cheesy one-liners. I really can't say how freaking awesome this movie is, it is just something you will have to experience for yourself. I liked it so much I just bought it on blu ray, minutes after watching a copy I checked out from the library. I never do that, so that says a lot.

If you don't like this movie, I will hit you with a shovel."
614,5.0,I still remember seeing this for the first time and freaking out at the werewolf change scene and the movie itself scared the crap out of me. An awesome movie.
615,5.0,"No doubt about, if you love Dane Cook and think he's s hottie. Then you better get this. He's freaking hilarious!"
616,5.0,Wow. Just freaking wow. Thank you Mr. Lee.
617,5.0,"I discovered Sacha from watching Borat, but Ali G is freaking hilarious!  I think I actually prefer his Ali G character more than Borat.  It's amazing how he convinces professionals in highly respected fields (the police force, CIA, religious figures, congressmen, politicians, and so on) to go on interviews.  He asks them the dumbest questions which is what makes it all so hilarious.  If you have any hesitations of purchasing it, just go to the youtube website and watch a clip of the skit called  ""ice cream glove"" in which he pitches an idea to Donald Trump and a plethora of other highly influential business leaders about the importance of gloves when eating ice cream. There is also a skit in which he is trying to publish a book, and he tells the publishers that he wrote a book on the film ""The Lord of the Ring"" without realizing that the film is based on a book.

In all seriousness, the skits when Borat goes to America hold a deeper meaning for me.  I believe that Borat is trying to bring to light the conservative views and values of the Southern United States, kind of telling and explaining to the rest of the world why Bush was reelected.  He wants to demonstrate how conservative our country really is, and how the older generations are still pretty ignorant about their views on race, homosexuals and other minority groups or groups with opposing views.  Even in his major US film release, he stopped at a church in Texas where there were judges and congressmen preaching in a church.  I believe in the seperation of church and state.

Anyway...the DVD is excellent, and in case you are wondering it does work in the US region.  Also the packaging is pretty nifty."
618,5.0,"I guess I was extremely spoiled by Season 1 (see my review there), waiting all those years to find that once the show had returned, it was back with a spine tingling, take your breath away with excitement, jump out of your seat in disbelief of such glorious scripts and performances, absolute freaking vengeance.  Now, onto series 2, I was in no doubt looking and expecting nearly the same, albeit with a different actor at the helm.  This was nothing different for Who fans, and with some slim exceptions, it all worked out well.

I know some of you say we can't compare this and series one, or this and that, but hey, it's what Who fans have been doing throughout time.  I firmly believed that as an entire season, last seasons series 1 of the new show ranked up there as possibly the best full run of episodes in Who's full run.  Having to follow that would be a true test indeed, and while I thought season 2 was very enjoyable, it wasn't quite as strong as 1.

There was evidence even in the promising first episode, The Christmas Invasion, that there was some little je ne sais quoi that I couldn't quite put a finger on, that made is ever so slightly down a notch from the high impact of season 1's shows.  There was further evidence when it came to season 2's first real episode, New Earth, as it muddled along without a whole lot of excitement to take in.

Thankfully, after the very good reunion of The Doctor, Sarah Jane, & K9, the show seemed to keep creeping up and up in excitement quality, until the brilliant season finale two parter.  In fact, this two part mind blowing season finish, was probably the first time I had felt as ecstatic as I did watching the entire first series episodes.

I was displeased that the second season never felt as unique as series 1, but nonetheless still had fun watching yet another strong run of episodes in Who's continuing history.  After thinking about it more and more, I came to the realization that it was less David Tennant vs. Eccleston that made the two series different, and more about the strong writing of series 1 compared to the medoicre scripts of season 2.  Season 1 just had more snappy dialogue for the doctor, more impactful events tightly woven into the 50 minute episodes, and overall better stories.

That's not to say this season didn't have it's share of goodies, including one of my favorites, Idiot's Lantern, dealing with supernatural events in the 1950's, and leading into the very spooky two parter, The Impossible Planet, and the Satan Pit.  It's just I couldn't help but think when I watched season 1, that this was hands down the best show on TV, the best sci-fi episodes on TV, and the best Who in a long time.  With season 2, I can't safely say that I enjoyed it better than say a season of The Dead Zone, Stargate, or Stargate Atlantis, but I can say it's a very enjoyable piece of sci fi and another superb addition to the Who Universe.  I just wish the scripts were tighter and flowed better.

On to David Tennant.  It took me a few episodes, for me to take a liking to him, but quickly found that he is just as quirky a Doc as any predecessor and deserves his worthy place among the rest.  He can bring his serious side out just as quickly and believable as his distinct, flamboyant one.  I think having him a second season will be a welcome event, after having Eccleston for one short one.  Hopefully, they will get the writing a little more up to snuff, and the excitement level, so I can once again, safely say there is nothing better on TV than Who.  For right now, I can't, but it's still an excellent season of Who, a smooth transition into a new Doctor, and left at a point where this new, yet old, franchise can continue to grow.  Here's looking toward season 3 ..."
619,5.0,This is freaking hysterical! Not for most adults either!
620,3.0,"This is one disturbing movie. The whole movie isn't that way, but when the lions kill, that's when the chills and thrills come out full throttle. The very first kill was the most unsetteling to me. It came almost out of no where but it was all set up to happen.

A stepmother, two bratty children, and a guide go on a safarri expedition while the father is at work. Since this movie is about the survival of the family, it should be no surprise that the guide is the first person to face his mortality... and it truly is a shame. Simply put, he died so a kid could go #2. And his death sequence was beyond mortifying to me. It seriously had me freaking out... as it was HIGHLY intense.

After his death, the stepmother and the kids are stranded and hopeful that the husband will come out in search of them while they stay in the car. Unfortunately, that is the only smart thing they do through the movie... as tension between the kids and their new stepmother boils over at the most inopprotune of moments. The lions are freaky... but when they are taken out by various ""would be rescuers"" it is so obviously fake (which... is ok cause I wouldn't want real lions to die for a campy film like this) and the action to be seen is when the lions are stalking.

Although intense, this film is sadly bogged downward by the poor acting. Only two people offered intersting characters... and wouldn't you know it... their fates are pretty much sealed from the get go. All of the main characters are either overplaying it or just phoning it in. But... do not despair... this is not a film that is meant to impress with solid acting chops. This is one for the survival film buffs... mother nature takes a lethal swipe at mankind in this thriller. It isn't unique or fresh... but it is pretty thrilling."
621,5.0,"I came across this series when it was on Netflix and was hooked.  As a fan of cartoons, I was blown away by how well crafted this series is, along with it's subsequent sequel series Alien Force and Ultimate Alien (not counting omniverse or the reboot series).

This series is very well written and constructed overall, as it taps into that essential element for young kids that dream of being superheroes, here is ben Tennyson getting that chance largely by accident.

I love how as the series progresses the mythology of the universe od this series builds and builds as we learn more about Grandpa max and his time as a 'plumber'.  Ans also see Ben still be your typical  10 year old but also learn about doing the right thing and about his responsibilities, even when he isn't  constantly bickering with his cousin Gwen.

That was one thingbthatnalways kinda bothered me watching many of these epusodes back to back , hearing the sniping  and bickering and gwen calling ben a dweeb a doofus a dork all the freaking time got really tiresome.  Im grateful that by the time Alien Force was made they made the characters older and pretty much had the antagonism between Ben and Gwen replaced with genuine familial affection.

Anyway, I loved how the people taht made this aeries were clearly comic book fans cu with the omnitrix and its abilities, it reminds one of tue Dial h for Hero, where the special dial allows the user to transform into different types of heroes for different types of situations.  I especially love how Ben tries to  go for  one alien hero and ends up with a different  one by mistake, which is funny but also Aids  in  teaching ben to think on his feet and make use of powers and abilities  at his disposal.  Also the fact that the omnitrix is green and even the symbol on the chest of each alien, and even the corps of plumbers being galactic defenders.and policemen, brings to  mind the green lantern Corps.

This first season sets the tone and also sets things in motion rather nicely."
622,5.0,"Why is it that great American humorists tend, almost inevitably, to gravitate toward the dark and the morbid and the bitter in the final stages of their lives?  Mark Twain is the prototype example (if you've forgotten, find a copy of ""Letters from the Earth""), but there are a multitude of others: Russell Baker, George S. Kaufman, Dorothy Parker, James Thurber, Robert Benchley, Frank Sullivan...Groucho...even Will Rogers was dabbling in the early stages at the time of his tragically premature demise.  Why?  Maybe some of them begin to take themselves too seriously; but I think most simply grow tired of the relentless pressure to be hilarious every single time.  Occasionally you see evidence of this, right in their work:  In ""I'll Take Manhattan"", a fat old lady walks up to Woody Allen -- another prototype example -- and says, ""My husband and I love your films; especially the early funny ones!""

So I suppose it's not surprising that George Carlin, who will surely be remembered as one of the greatest of great American humorists, followed this same dark path in the twilight of his long career.  The trend is evident from the beginning of the HBO specials, and reaches a climax in this macabre offering.  Is it over the top?  Of course -- but what Carlin material, from ""AM and FM"" on, wasn't?  Is it disturbing?  Yes -- but George always enjoyed disturbing his audiences, prodding them into a bit of independent contemplation.  Is it his best stuff?  No -- he sounds too much like a bitter old man, as he sometimes did during the last few years -- but like just about everything else he wrote, it's freaking brilliant -- and that's why it gets 5 stars, and an unreserved recommendation from me.

Like most Carlin material, this is not for small children, or for self-righteous Fox News Channel devotees."
623,5.0,"I think in some ways they may try to be recouping any losses from Season One. I bought S1 with it's 30 episodes at nearly an hour EACH (30 HOURS) for $19.99. I think they may have wanted to get the first set out there to remind people how GREAT this show was (which it WAS), and now that we all remember they are charging a fair price, IMO. In my estimation it will be about 14 episodes for $30, or 14 hours of FLAWLESS entertainment for $30. Priced movies lately? An hour and a half will cost you $15 and only then GOD help you with todays movie making quality (READ: GARBAGE).

I will take the Big Valley any way they can get it to me. Face it, it's only 4 seasons I can live with this price structure and release format simply because the show was/IS that good. I will pay this price and SMILE doing it, in DVD ""feature movie pricing"" 14 hours would run you $140.

I will NOT defend the cover art snafoo though.... too bad it wasn't of William Shatner, he would LOVE IT!!

LASTLY PEOPLE, STOP ENCOURAGING OTHERS NOT TO BUY THIS, IF YOU DON'T WANT IT, FINE, BUT IF WE DON'T BUY THIS SPLIT SEASON THERE WON'T BE ANY OTHERS RELEASED FOR YOU TO CRY ABOUT. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THESE AS SPLIT SEASONS THAN NONE AT ALL!!!

And how is it a rip off if a 30 ep. 30 minute comedy like That Girl is $30 and so is a 14 ep. hour long set like this? It's the same freaking minutes people!!"
624,5.0,"The other reviews of JCamp have called out the contents very well, need not be repeated by me.

I was struck by how much Becky and the others seemed to admire the pedagogical style and educational totalism of radical Islam. I guess all totalitarian movements are alike.

It was also interesting how religious commitment is so very strictly tied to emotional and physical expressiveness. Crying, reeling, writhing, screaming, babbling - anything physically emotive seems to be very much admired, while silent prayer (or God forbid, meditation), even in a religious context, would seem to be condemned as the way of a ""dead church"". They want your EMOTIONS involved, and that can only be proven to them via your BODY histrionics. Physical hysterics are the coin of the realm to the people in this video, and rightly so, as all that freaking out tends to block rational thought.

I suppose the North Korean cult of Kim Jung Il and Kim Il Sung isn't much different in methods and goals.

Some of the kids were great. It is interesting that the camp attendee Levi, was apparently evident to BOTH the preacher people AND the documentary makers as a potential telegenic star of some kind, whether a Marjoe Gortner or what we don't yet know. It will be interesting to see.

Levi has the distinction of offering the best spontaneous line in the film, at the very end, when he and his fanatic lil friend Rachel are out on the street in DC, targeting sinners for salvation by handing out pamphlets to passers by.

Rachel asks Levi:
""Is it possible these people think we are SELLING something??""

He replies:
""Some of them probably think so.""

Rachel retorts rhetorically:
""But we are just KIDS! What could WE possibly be SELLING??""

Levi doesn't skip a beat:
""Whatever is in our hands."""
625,5.0,"Long before the NWO,the Studd Stable, DX, Evolution and countless other super groups there was the 4 Horsemen.  It was around 1985 when 4 of the greatst stars of their era came together:  Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Ole Anderson and Tully Blanchard.  They added JJ Dillion and thus the Horsemen were born.  The first part of the DVD set that u get to see is the documentary on the group which details the formation of the group plus most if not all of the incarnations of the Horsemen.  So many awesome talents have been Horsemen and all are told in this set:  Sting and his subsequent forced removal from the group, Lex Luger, the very underrated Barry Windham, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, etc.  I did like how they explained the so called family ties with in the original members of the group which told that Arn, Ole and Flair were all cousins.  This is finally answered.  They do show when the Horsemen very viciously attacked Dusty Rhodes within a steel cage and ""broke"" his leg.  I remember at the time this was such a huge deal within the NWA.  They also like home video footage of the Horsemen attacking Dusty outside of some store or plumber place or something and breaking his arm.  Awesome stuff that we don't get to see today.  Of course they talk about Ole leaving the group and Luger joining.  I never got why they chose him but they did.  We also get some history in the War Games match as at one time this was considered the Horsemen's match.  They do talk about Barry Windham joing the group who in my opinion is just a fantastic member.  I think he was a perfect fit to the group and in a lot of people's opinions formed the best group of the Horsemen along with Tully, Arn and Flair.  Some people wonder why Ole isn't on the cover of this set and I think it's cuz of Barry being a more popular member and the fact that Ole is so hated within the wrestling community that it isn't funny.  Next they talk about Sting and his brief time within the Horsemen and his getting kicked out in one of the greatest moments in wrestling history.  They also talk about Sid and don't have a lot of good things to say about him.  They even talk about the hotel room/stabbing incident with Sid and Arn.  One of the funniest moments on this set is when the group for some unknown reason decided to add Paul Roma to the group.  You've just got to hear Roma and how full of himself he is.  I mean he basically says that he was good for the group cause he was so good looking he gave people something good to look at.  Give me a break!  We hear about Benoit being added and Pillman and then Mongo and then Dean Malenko and some others.  All in all just a great documentary.  I'm hoping that with the induction of the Horsemen in the hall of fam this year that this will lead to yet another dvd set of the Horsemen.  The extras were good and included Flair talking about the wildest night in the business, the footage of them attacking Dusty in that parking lot, a Barry Windham story on Lex Luger that is just funny as crap and some interviews plus more.  The matches were good as well and included:

Arn Anderson, Ole Anderson and Ric Flair vs. Pez Whatley, the Italian Stallion and Rocky King from NWA tv 6/22/1985:  This was just your standard television match for that time period but it is cool to see the Anderson's and Flair together.

Ric Flair vs. Ricky Morton from Great American Bash 7/5/1986 in a cage match:  Morton was a part of the Rock and Roll Express but has a beef with Flair cuz of his attack on Morton and breaking his nose.  Awesome match from start to finish (Ricky was really underrated and proved it in this match).  Of course there was blood and just some very exciting back and forth action from both.  It did look like at times that Ricky would pull this off and win the title but to no avail.  By the way, check out Flair's awesome entrance before the match.  Great one.

Tully Blanchard vs. Dusty Rhodes from Starrcade 1986 11/27/1986 in a first blood match for the TV title:  This was a pretty good match but they would have better ones including some fantastic cage matches and a ladder/barbed wire from GAB 1987.  This match was good but we do see both guys wrestling fairly defensively due to the first blood stip in the match and I think this hindered what would have been a very good match.

Four Horsemen vs. Dusty Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, Lex Luger, Steve Williams and Paul Ellering from Great American Bash 7/16/1988 in a War Games match:  This match was not near as good as some of the previous War Games matches that took place.  This match was conjured up by Dusty Rhodes and is still considered one of the most brutal matches of its kind.  I do think there is a misprint in the date for this match.  I think in 1988 there was only GAB event with Luger and Flair main eventing.  I thought this match took place at the Citrus Bowl in 1987 when the GAB went on a tour.  I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Anyway, this match is good but near as good as the first two that took place in 1987 on that tour.  Also there is on commentary for this one which normally doesn't bother me but I just think u need that in a War Games match.  Still plenty of action and blood for everyone.

Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard vs. Sting and Nikita Koloff at Great American Bash 7/10/1988:  Great match with lots of back and forth action.  I have often felt that Blanchard and Anderson were very underrated as a tag team and just freaking brilliant to watch in the ring.  I know Shawn Michaels really loved to work with them when he was in the Rockers.  Anyhow great match here that goes to a 20 min time limit draw.  Oh if only they could have added just 10 more mins.

Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard vs. Barry Windham and Lex Luger at Clash I for the NWA Tag titles 3/27/1988:  Awesome match and fantastic title change.  The fans are so into this one that it's hard not to get caught up in it.

Ric Flair vs. Arn Anderson at Fall Brawl 9/17/1995:  They said it wud never happen but it did and boy what a great wrestling match this was.  From start to finish these guys gave us everything they had and then some.  Most people do get pissed off because Brian Pillman interfered in the match and caused Flair to lose (I think most wanted to see a straight up match just to see who was truly better) but still this match is probably the best one they have on this set.

All in all this is a great DVD set with a lot of classic matches and a great story about how the greatest super group of all time was created and ran rough shod over the NWA and WCW.  Could u just imagine what these guys could have done in the WWE back in the day?  Great set that will stand the test of time and as I stated earlier:  It wud be nice to see another Horsemen set come out with more interview, more footage of them attacking other wrestlers and more matches on it.  That wud just be great.  Get this set!  Highly recommended!"
626,5.0,"I am a of Scorsese and of some types of violent films.  This film is so freaking amazing, I have been watching it probably twice year since it came out.  So I saw a deal and got a copy.  It's been several years now, but at the time it blew my mind.  Everyone dies.  That's a great twist for a mob movie.  But that's just one detail.  I think Jack does an amazing job.  All the performances are a ten.  Great symbolism, scenery (I love Boston), story, soundtrack.  And long ago Mick sang, ""all sinners saints, every cop a criminal.""  So the nature of the human to have both sides, the duality that is explored, makes it all the more interesting.  Is Colin a product of his environment?  Does he just owe Frank everything?  Or is he really bad and will do anything to get ahead, whatever it is?  We certainly don't see him torn and tormented like Billy is.  The second disc has some great stuff."
627,5.0,Are you a martial arts fan? If so this movie needs to be in your collection.  This movie is freaking awesome. Once you have seen this....go see the raid 2.
628,5.0,"First things first, don't watch the ""Redemption"" aspect of this film. Just watch ""The Raid"". It's better without the inexplicably terrible new Linkin Park soundtrack and astonishingly comical dub.

The remix is in no way an improvement over the original soundtrack. I've nothing against LP, believe me, but the original soundtrack is simply more exciting and a lot more dramatic--I have no clue why they thought this poorly-done new soundtrack was warranted, because it makes the movie less exciting.

OK, we have that out of the way? Cool. Now, if you've done this properly, you'll be listening to the original audio with subtitles (I know they can be annoying and I don't like to have to read subtitles either if I can help it, but anything's better than this laughably bad dub that couldn't possibly have taken more than a single afternoon).

So, it goes like this:
The Raid: Redemption: One star. Seriously, with the dub and new soundtrack, you can't even take it as a dumb action flick. It's there, but with the new audio, it's just...No, just no.
The Raid (original): Five stars. Yes, it's that much better than the default settings on the disc.

Now let's review ""The Raid"" briefly, in a few pros and cons to keep it nice and brief.

Pros:
- Some of the best martial arts sequences you'll ever see, especially given the cool context (no one's flying through China here on trees like in Crouching Tiger, it's just guns and fists and a lot of violent punching and kicking, not to mention some exciting takedowns involving windows, machetes, and exploding refrigerators.)
- Best. Villain. Ever. Not the drug-lord guy, he doesn't really do anything, but Mad Dog, his protector, who is portrayed as a maniac...And he really is. The title of ""Mad Dog"" fits him perfectly, as he just detonates into a fury of complex martial arts when he gets into his fights, all of which are very exciting. He clearly and openly seeks out challengers for hand-to-hand combat among everyone there, since he often gives the good guys tremendous advantages on purpose just so he can have some sort of fun. He never uses a gun because, as he says, ""I never liked these things. Pulling a trigger to kill someone is just way too simple. It's like ordering take-out."" He literally positions two characters between him at one point before a fight just for the hell of it, like fighting one at a time isn't any fun at all and no challenge whatsoever. And who can blame him? You just can't stop this guy from beating the life out of everyone he comes across. He lives to fight hand-to-hand, and that's it. Screw guns, they're just a nuisance. He has this fanaticism of killing people with his bare hands, purely for the rush, to the point that he literally gets bored with fighting normally and intentionally ups the difficulty for himself (such as the aforementioned two-on-one he sets up for no real reason except his own pleasure). Yeah, he's one scary bastard.
- The Dragon of the film, Mad Dog, has his own finishing move, and it's not what you think. It's freaking frightening.  When he first uses it, it's just insane and unbelievably violent, yet signature for him. He's one scary bastard, even with a gun pointed at him.
- Crazy-cool protagonist who does a great job being a protagonist who can beat the crap out of anyone without mercy, you know, for justice.
- The police sergeant is also really cool and authoritative in his own way, and he definitely isn't all talk and no action. He also comes off as pretty intelligent along with being fierce. Nicely done character.

Cons:
- The plot is virtually identical to Dredd. Seriously, if you haven't seen Dredd, this is the film, just in a different context and with a higher budget. Even some of the scenes seem strikingly similar. Menacing drug lord on a high floor? Check. Sealed inside? Check. The practice of buying police to protect the drug lord from police? Check. Residents told to fight protagonists? Check. Drug lord on top floor watching everything through monitors? Check. Some similar spoilers? Check. Drug lab fight scene? Um...Yeah, check. I could go on, but yeah, pretty much the same movie, except Dredd was, well, Judge Dredd.
- For better or worse, and maybe not really a con, every single person in this film--all of which are oriental--seem to know advanced martial arts, even the freaking guys making meth who are minding their own business. Yes, it has that thing where every single Asian character knows martial arts, like they're somehow born with it. The meth lab guys are a real piece of work. There's no reason for them to know any type of self-defense, but they're still skilled enough to give the protagonists a good fight.
- The story initially appears to be the dumbest thing you've ever seen in your life and makes zero sense. This isn't a spoiler: The police can't handle when the power is cut. Yeah, apparently no one thought of that and brought so much as flashlights with them.
- The box says ""30 Floors of Hell"". There aren't 30 floors, there are clearly 15. The drug lord's on the 15th floor. What's with the extra 15 floors we never see?
- The box also says, iirc, ""15 Elite Cops"". But they aren't, they're rookies. That's not because they do stupid things, but because they're pointed out to almost all be rookies early in the film. So, uh, that's a lie. Not a big one, since the main characters can still kick enough ass for all of them combined, but these definitely aren't ""elite cops"". See: Flashlight problem, mentioned above.
- Gunplay is a bit over-the-top, since *everyone* uses fully-automatic assault rifles that apparently don't need reloading (do they ever replace their magazines?) throughout the film. Some might not mind that, but one Commando is enough. There is no unit on the planet that uses fully automatic weapons for the simple reason that it's a dumb idea, and when they're all *missing* with that wasted ammunition, it kind of destroys the effect. They might as well be semi-autoing, you know, like every police or military unit does in close-quarters combat.
- That thing regarding Andi...Well, not so well done. For his significance, he felt horribly underdeveloped, considering his key role in the film. They say a few sentences about him and that's it, despite that he turns out to be really, really significant. Well, whatever, no spoilers.

SUMMARY:
Okay, so that sounds like a lot of negatives, sure, but they're not that bad. The pros make up for it. It's not too long, it's stylish, and it gets its job done. Sure, the plot's about as deep as a generic PlayStation 2 shooter, but that's not necessarily an awful thing. It's a dumb popcorn flick, after all, and isn't supposed to be anything else, so no points off.

Just remember: DO NOT LISTEN TO THE STUPID REMIX. And while you *may* be able to stomach the dub, it *does* suck. You'll probably choose subtitles, and you'll definitely want the original audio, which is paradoxically a lot more intense and heavy-metalish (as opposed to the downright strange and even boring electronic/nu-metal Linkin Park thing they threw on there) than the remix.

Go for it if you want nothing but the dumbest of action and you like violent martial arts. Just remove the ""Redemption"" piece of it in favor of the much-better basic ""The Raid"" and you'll be good."
629,5.0,"What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? It has quite possibly the MOST gore and violence that I have ever seen packed into ONE movie! The way it was filmed was also very original. There are a few tense, suspenseful scenes but that usually means it will soon EXPLODE into chaos, fast, crazy camera work and extreme violence, shooting, killing, fighting and explosions.

For those of you who want some long, detailed plot explanation there really isn't one. What you read in the description and see in the trailers is basically what you get but with a lot more blood. It's a raid. Things get ugly and tons of people die in really crazy, gory ways. It had a great ending though it was a pretty typical one for an Asian martial arts film. It does have subtitles but even without them it's NOT hard to figure out what is going on. This is a movie about what happens when the you-know-what hits the fan...people fight, people die and people do very bad things...the end!

So it wasn't the best quality movie ever...It didn't have the best budget and it doesn't have any well-known actors with their shirts off...BUT it did have pretty good intensity and realism from the actors which is rare in an action movie. It had insane martial arts moves. It also had really violent, clever and gory scenes filmed in ways that have not been done before and it scores major uniqueness points for all the crazy death scenes.

The best thing about this movie was that my boyfriend LOVED it! It's probably not a good ""date movie"" but then again, it depends on who your date is. There are those ladies out there (ME!) who like a good action movie too. If you are offended by extreme violence this probably isn't the movie for you. If you happen to enjoy non-stop action, fighting, shooting, blood and a high death-toll in a film, then this movie will deliver all that and more. I have to say it is probably the most violent movie I have ever seen. There was never a dull moment and I give it five stars for being SO freaking insane!"
630,4.0,"Scream Factory brings middle-aged horror fans another piece of their childhood on Blu-ray with the release of the ""Night of the Comet"" Collector's Edition. Here's another perfect example of a movie I grew up on and spent many summer days watching while on vacation at my father's house. A combination of ""Night of the Living Dead,"" ""The Omega Man,"" and ""Valley Girl"" makes this quirky film an essential addition to any fan's 1980's genre collection.

Everyone is celebrating the return of a comet that hasn't buzzed by the Earth in 65 million years. The last time it swung by, the dinosaurs went extinct. How can it come as a surprise that this time around it incinerates humans and leaves survivors mutated and ravenous for human flesh? Two Los Angeles valley girls (Catherine Mary Stewart and Kelli Maroney) join forces with a truck driver (Robert Beltran) as they run for their lives from the walking dead and scientists intent on draining their blood in an attempt to find a cure for the zombie outbreak.

""Night of the Comet"" perfectly captures the tone of the 1980s in every way. The feeling of paranoia about the world coming to an end is one element. I remember reading about the planets aligning and how this could cause the apocalypse. It seems like every day the papers or television would feature stories about impending nuclear Armageddon.

It was a scary time for kids and the fact that two valley girls in a big city like L.A. could survive gave many a teenager hope they could as well. In what other time period besides the 1980s would we see two high school girls raid a shopping mall and try on clothes while listening to ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" on a jam box. Keep in mind, this is right after discovering the world had come to an end? However, the best part comes when they wield semi-automatic rifles dressed to the nines against mutated delivery boys. These are just a few of the reasons why ""Night of the Comet"" is such a charming part of horror cinema history.

On top of all that, we also get the usual ""Don't Trust the Older Generation"" message. There's nothing adolescents distrust and hate more than authority figures telling them what to do. ""Night of the Comet's"" examples of these suspicious characters come in the form of a group of scientists willing to kill survivors in search of an antidote for themselves.

The film is rated PG-13 for violence, language, adult situations, and gore. ""Night of the Comet"" is tame in comparison to most zombie and horror films. This is the type of movie designed for the masses. You could watch it with people who don't frequently watch scary movies. It's perfect for helping get lightweights into the Halloween spirit without completely freaking them out.

The ""Night of the Comet"" Collector's Edition gives consumers exactly what they want when it comes to bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by actors Kelli Maroney, Catherine Mary Stewart, Mary Woronov, Director/Writer Thom Eberhardt, and Production Designer John Muto. There are new interviews with Catherine Mary Stewart, Kelli Maroney, Robert Beltran, and Special Make-up Effects creator David B. Miller. It also contains a film photo gallery, behind-the-scenes photo gallery, and a theatrical trailer.

The high-definition transfer of ""Night of the Comet"" is exactly what most will want and expect. It's a cleaner and better picture, but doesn't lose the grainy feel we all love when we watch 1980's flicks. It's presented in 1080p High-Definition Widescreen (1.78:1) and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1/Mono. The movie's boisterous blend of pop music, gunshots, and growling zombies have never sounded better.

The ""Night of the Comet"" Collector's Edition is another fine example of the respect Scream Factory has for cult classics that might not see the light of day on Blu-ray because of a niche audience. Once again, they go above and beyond by providing fans with special features that give us an insight into the making of the movie and the impact it's had on audiences. Hopefully, it will also give new people the opportunity to see it for the first time. Great new ""vintage-style"" cover art for the release is the icing on the cake."
631,1.0,"Only a single After Dark Horror Fest 8 Films To Die For movie was any good (""Abandoned"" - highly recommended). But after trusting the bad reviews for years I stupidly gave in and wasted 90 minutes of my life on this heap of incompetence. The basic premise seems reasonably promising, and the movie is mostly competently acted; but it's also abysmally written and directed, with poor ghost-zombie make-up on top of all its other short-comings. Random examples of dumb moments (no spoilers here): car is stuck, something scary is happening, person A is revving engine incredibly loudly while yelling and trying to get attention of person B who is outside of car. Suggestion to person A: stop revving the freaking engine and maybe person B will hear you, you idjit. Another: girl opens kitchen cabinet and there sit a couple of squirmy rats. Soooo....I guess the rats, what, opened the up-high cabinet, climbed in, and politely closed the door behind them? Another: Woman sees rat on her kitchen table and just kinda shews it away. Sooo...I guess on the table is a no-no but off in the kitchen corner or in the living room is just fine by her? (And by the way, when was the last time a rat in a movie was creepy or scary - ""Willard,"" maybe? Horror movie makers should from this point on be forbidden from ever using rats. It should be a rule or an ordinance or something.) Another: someone is killed above the head of character A and blood begins pouring down. Does character A move over a foot or so to get out from under the bloodfall? No. Character A is very happy to stand there beneath someone's opened arteries, thank you very much. Idiotic. Should you choose to watch this drek, I won't give away the one or two gigantic plot holes which ultimately spell doom for the flick. If there were one or two dumb moments and the rest of the movie was solid, okay. But the bad writing and direction have a cumulative effect which quickly overwhelms any hope for redemption."
632,5.0,"To understand these movies is to truly understand what HorrorFest and Movies to Die For IS and IS NOT.

What it IS NOT: It is not a series of extreme or graphic movies that cannot be released to the public by theaters. Some of these are graphic, but not to the point where these were being hidden away from public viewing.

What it IS: HorrorFest is however a great concept from the director of AN AMERICAN HAUNTING who is a huge fan of the horror genre. The director is quoted in Fangoria as saying, ""I was pissed off that there were so many cool and different types of horror films that were made for the big screen, but weren't getting there. I really wanted to create a venue that would at least let some of them [get on the screen] for a limited time. So from that, the idea for the Horrorfest was born.""

So they put the word on the street for people to send their movies to them for a chance to be selected to be part of HorrorFest and have their movie on the big screen. They received about 50 movies in all and so they selected an assortment of different horror themes for the public to see. They are not all one type over the other. They each stand on their own and in my opinion are just great.

Some more than others for sure.

I think DARK RIDE is one of those that is really, really good. Without going into the fine details on the synopsis of the movie, I will tell you briefly it is a throwback to the good ole slasher films, but this one is different where the writer and director went further in character development and creating a wonderful atmosphere.

Yes you have young kids making dumb decisions and getting killed for it, but that's what you expect when you see these movies. No, in real life no one is going to have sex in a creepy house or on a creepy ride, except maybe my friend Bentley, but that's a different story entirely. This movie does what it sets out to do: Introduce us to a wicked killer, bring in the kids, take them towards the DARK RIDE, and scare us along the way. This movie delivers!

And let me tell you...WOW!!! This ride is very creepy. The jolts and shocks came and I recommend if you have 5.1 surround, turn down the lights and crank it up!!! That's what I did and I found myself hearing things all over the room and it was freaking me out!

Most of all I am so glad there is a HorrorFest because I know for myself I do not rent straight-to-dvd horror movies because they typically look lame. Only twice have I been proven wrong and that was with SESSION 9 and DEADBIRDS. HorrorFest gives life to some movies that may have went straight to dvd and never got the publicity it rightly deserved. I hope you take the chance to experience this movie and I highly recommend you seeing UNREST, REINCARNATION, and GRAVEDANCERS as well.

I cant wait until HorrorFest 2007. It's going to be even better!"
633,5.0,"This is a PERFECT example of an excellent DVD.  It has incredible picture and sound quality, awesome extras, and [best of all] it's an unbelievely GREAT movie.
First of all, the picture quality is great.  I have a regular 36"" TV and watching this movie on VHS blurrs some details.  For instance the ending scene with Lector walking away free in some forgein country, unlike on the VHS, on the DVD version, everyone of the dozens of people Lector passes by is explicitly clear and is clearly defined.
Next, the bonus stuff is super.  It has lots of deleted scenes, including a few which introduce the character of Paul Krendler [who plays a major role in ""Hannibal""].  Then the Outtake reel was nice, after being so tense watching the movie, it was nice to see outtakes of the characters acting naturally.  The featurette was also nice [for a featurette], but what really blew my socks off was the documentary.  The documentary, entitled ""Inside the Labyrinth"" was about 1 hr 10 min long, and was incredibly interesting and well put together.  It was surprizing to find all the incredible behind the scenes talent who worked on this movie; like Coleen Atwood, Howard Shore, Kristi Zea.  Also, after freaking me out in the movie, it was neat seeing Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill) out of character.  Exceptional documentary on an exceptional movie.
This is now one of the favorite DVDs, and an incredible addition to any DVD collection."
634,5.0,"I recently saw The Exorcist in theaters.  Scariest movie of all time my foot.  Which of these keeps you awake at night: a little girl in green makeup, or a tongue-devouring, muzzle-clad Anthony Hopkins?  This is the only movie that has even come close to freaking me out.  Hopkins held me in a trance with his big, penetrating eyes... Foster delivered the best performance of her career... the intensity and visual style of the whole thing made it unforgettable.  The psychological thriller to end all psychological thrillers and subtly frightening enough to gain itself the position of the scariest movie ever made.
NOTE: If The Exorcist, The Sixth Sense, The Haunting, or any other such ""scary movie"" gave you the creeps, never watch The Silence of the Lambs if you hope to sleep again.  Then again, that's a small price to pay for an experience such as this."
635,4.0,"Honestly, watching Silence of the Lambs nowadays, it's just so freaking obvious how much the X-Files took from it.  Of course, much has been said about  Foster's Starling being the inspiration for the X-Files's Dana  Scully.  However, the influence of this movie -- the cinemtography, mood,  dialogue, pacing, costumes, and villians -- is just so clear on the  X-Files, especially its first season.
Unfortunatedly, having watched the  X-Files for years, it has dulled the impact of Silence of the Lambs.  Its  style has been so copied and done that Silence of the Lambs merely now  seems like among the best of its type, rather than a groundbreaking  thriller.
Still, I'd highly recommend its viewing, if nothing else but to  see where the X-Files took its basic skeleton from."
636,1.0,"No freaking idea what this Limey is saying...he's totally incomprehensible. ""Mumbklekafootie. Frathhhhrockianfthinngg, Harry, harooooump bobabthhhh, carewwwthhh...."""
637,2.0,"its ok. but I need to know were do they find so many idiots for their show?.
here is an example of the level of intelligence we are dealing with here: "" & the 3rd clue stated that it was in a pine tree. So I started looking for pine trees."" WOW you are a freaking genius."
638,1.0,"You know, I'm really starting to question this love affair I have with The Asylum's films.  There's certainly nothing glorious about the badness of Supercroc; it's just a cheap movie with terrible acting, the thinnest of plots, and laughable special effects.  The audio and video quality of the film leaves much to be desired as well.  Heck, even the editing is awful - either that or at least one character has the remarkable ability to transport herself several inches in space in the blink of an eye.  If that weren't bad enough (and it is), we don't even get the pleasure of seeing the film's most annoying character eaten alive at any time.  There just is no justice to be found in this sub-mediocre addition to the annals of giant monster films.

The action begins with the world's most unprofessional army squad stalking around a lake area some fifty or so miles north of Los Angeles.  What are they searching for?  No one's telling because they're too busy jabbering about the upcoming wedding of Private Perez (Cynthia Rose Hall) and her same-squad boyfriend.  The Sarge throws out a few weak hand signals, trying to look like he knows what he's doing, but his own ineptitude soon becomes wholly apparent when an impossibly huge crocodile sneaks up on him (in one of the most pathetic special effects moments in the history of film).  Unaware that they're dealing with a Supercroc some sixty feet in length and who knows how many tons in weight, the army keeps sending soldiers into the area.  That would be a mistake - especially since none of them share Pvt. Perez's unparalleled knowledge of crocodile behavior (she's from Florida, don't you know).  Fortunately, a forensic paleontologist (Kim Little) just happens to be in the command room to tell them what they are up against - a master predator with virtually invulnerable armor.  Hmmm - I wonder if some secret military project might be interested in finding out more about this creature?  This sounds like a job for a daisy cutter to me, but apparently the American military has only limited ammunition with which to protect the freaking west coast - and nothing they throw at the creature does anything more than just make it cranky.  The way things are going, Los Angeles is going to be toast.  And did I mention the hundred or so Supercroc eggs just waiting to be hatched?

I did learn a few things from Supercroc.  Up until now, I had no idea that forensic paleontologists could issue direct orders to American troops, nor did I know that Apache helicopters were never designed to be crocodile-proof.  I also had no idea that CGI effects could be implemented so badly by anyone with at least a high school education.  I'll admit I'm surprised and disappointed to learn that our military is utterly defenseless in the face of a crocodile attack, but who knew that we had the wherewithal to easily evacuate the population of Los Angeles in less than twenty minutes?

Really, though, this film is in dire need of a Tiffany and/or Debbie Gibson in the cast.  And an action scene.  Yes, you heard me right, not once in this entire movie do we actually get to see Supercroc actually attack someone; and, apart from one explosion off in the distance, there is not a single shot of any croc-targeted bomb actually going off.  Supercroc is an action movie with no action (or suspense or horror or anything else that might possibly translate into an iota of enjoyment for the viewer).  You know, the best way to survive a crocodile attack is to never go anywhere near the freaking thing to begin with; I suggest you apply that same logic to this film."
639,5.0,"It was a complete joy to see this show again after thirty-four years! Yes, it is hammy and ultra-low budget, but it is freaking Shakespeare compared to the current Nick line-up! Bob Burns shines as Tracey the gorilla and it is so great to see Larry and Forest together again and at only 15 episodes the series is short enough to get through but not long enough to wear out its' welcome. Plus there are a ton of guest stars like Ted ""Mary Tyler Moore/Caddyshack"" Knight and Jim ""Mr. Magoo"" Bachus involved. And the extras! A shocking number for a series that is not considered ""influential"" or ""important"". BCI went WAY above the call of duty on this one with the extras!

As to the video quality, it holds up very well for a mid-70's video tape production. Luckily the source materials were well preserved. It is not hi-def, but it is certainly watchable.

My son is four and loves this show. It contains no ""gross"" humor (unlike almost every kid's show since ""Ren & Stimpy""), no toy pushing and since the episodes are only about 22 minutes long, they are great for kids with short attention spans. Not to mention that the ""horror"" elements are really toned down. I can't see a kid getting nightmares from this show. Highly recommended."
640,1.0,"There were so many bad things about this movie. The acting was Horrible! The film quality was so bad, and it was freaking Boring!!"

642,1.0,"A horribly stupid movie. The casting and acting could not possibly be more irritating---I mean the MOST annoying actors in the galaxy. The entire plot is stupid, makes no sense whatever, and if you b reak it down into it's sub-themes, it just gets worse. This is a freaking cartoon. I hated it."
643,5.0,"One of the very few movies to concentrate on how someone with autism functions as an adult. Sigourney Weaver astounds in the role of Linda, switching from childlike innocence to blunt honesty, from freaking out during normal situations to offering surprisingly lucid words of wisdom, it's a travesty she was not nominated for an Oscar for her performance. Equally amazing is the, well ALWAYS amazing, Alan Rickman, another performance that was more than worthy of an Oscar. The character of Alex invokes such an amazing amount of pathos as we are taken through his journey through the eyes of Linda, Maggie, Vivienne, and the local townspeople. Carrie Moss does another fine turn in her role, almost a gypsy-like woman in a small town....it's no wonder Alex makes his assumptions about her based on what Linda had told him! It's also interesting to see the well-meaning yet almost embarrassing platitudes offered up to Linda throughout the film. All in all, this movie is an underrated, underappreciated gem that deserved far more attention than it did, headed up by two phenomenal performances that, IMNSHO, should have been nominated for just about every major award possible."

645,3.0,"I wasn't paying much attention when Superman died.  It passed without fanfare in my geekiverse because I knew that Superman would come back, the same way I keep expecting Captain America to pop up any day now.

Amazon Unbox downloaded this movie to my Tivo right after it taped the introduction of Superman to The Batman cartoon series, the current anime-inspired version of Batman.  And to my surprise, all of the voice actors from the Justice League cartoon series were back in the Batman cartoon: George Newbern as the serious Superman, Dana Delaney as the sarcastic Lois Lane, and Clancy Brown as the debonair and devious Lex Luthor. With both on my Tivo, it was easy to make a comparison between the two animated depictions of Superman.

Warning: This review contains spoilers.  RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!

The character designs have been altered a bit from the Superman animated series.  Superman (voiced by Adam Baldwin) has bizarrely drawn cheekbones in this movie.  Everyone else more or less looks the same, although Lex Luthor (voiced by James Marsters) is a ""white guy"" again; the Superman cartoon cast him as a Kojak-like darker skinned man who became progressively lighter skinned in each incarnation. Lois (voiced by Anne Heche, of all people) still looks like Lois, wearing impossibly short skirts and yet achieving an amazing range of athletic moves.  Three cheers for animated physics!

Superman: Doomsday really enjoys its PG-13-ness. People say funny cuss words like ""freaking,"" have relations, and die -- bloodlessly, but they still die. This is an animation for grown-ups, folks!

The voice actors do a suitable job.  Heche is actually the best of the bunch, providing a full range of emotions to Lois.  Adam Wylie is great as Jimmy Olsen, but I don't give him quite as much props as he's not exactly new to the DC animation universe (he's the voice of Brainiac 5 in Legion of Super-Heroes). The most egregious loss is Brown as Lex Luthor.  Clancy Brown's gravelly baritone has always given the character a subtle menace.  In Superman: Doomsday, Lex is just a bald guy with an attitude.

And thus we have the first of several problems with this movie. Lex is a one-dimensional villain bent on destroying Superman.  You know you're in trouble when you can make ""he's so evil..."" jokes. For example:

* Lex is so evil, he has the cure for cancer but doesn't share it with the world!
* He's so evil, he has a special room created just for beating up Superman!
* He's so evil, he shoots his own henchmen to cover up his operations!

Lex practically cackles his way through the entire series and is so patently unlikable that he hardly seems like an actual foil for Superman.  In fact, the only noteworthy contribution Lex contributes is his gripe that Superman was killed by an ""intergalactic soccer hooligan!"" I have to agree with him.

After a long, protracted fight with a goofy-looking muscle-bound gargoyle named Doomsday, Superman dies.

What made the death of Superman so important was the way the writers dealt with his death. Superman is as much a divine being and an iconic symbol as he is an alien who protects Earth; his death had emotional repercussions on the level of Elvis and Marilyn Monroe, and the comics made a point of showing what a world without Superman was like.  His death helped create Steel and Superboy and other heroes I didn't keep track of because I wasn't reading the comics at the time.

You won't find any of that here.  We have a few minutes of mourning, a few minutes of revelations (Lois knew Superman's identity, Lois meets Martha Kent, Lois and Superman were getting it on), and then Superman returns.  Only he's mean.

And so, Superman: Doomsday isn't just about Superman dying at the hands of a super villain - it's about Superman being the not-so-noble guy we always knew he could be.  This new, resurrected version acts with brutal efficiency.  That's most epitomized by his murder of the Toyman after Superman 2.0 discovers that Toyman escape from prison and killed a little girl in a hostage crisis.

There's a reckoning, of course: two Supermen battling it out, comparable to the Doomsday fight only with more blood and clever asides. And like the end of the movie, punch for punch, the old Superman (Animated Series) beats the new Superman (Doomsday), hands down."
646,4.0,"I almost wish I'd never heard of Reno: 911! before I saw this movie. That way I probably would never have known that it wouldn't be as good as the TV show. Oh make no mistake - it's still outrageously hilarious, but even extra running time and the gift of not being censored can't fully restore this to its Comedy Central glory.

The hapless Sheriff's Department of Washoe County is invited to a Law Enforcement convention in Miami. Taking a bus (yes, a bus!) across the country, they arrive only to discover they aren't located on the paperwork, and must stay at a no-tell motel with a rude, seedy desk clerk (Toby Huss, as always, perfect). Their first night in Miami doesn't quite go as well as planned, and each officer ends up, um...let's just say alone.

In the morning they arrive at the convention center only to find that ALL of the other officers have been poisoned and are under quarantine, and they are the only unaffected group. Therefore, they are the defacto protectors of Miami.

Scary, huh? There are some wonderful cameos in this movie: Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) has a small role as a SWAT agent, as well as Patton Oswalt, Mindy Sterling, Paul Rudd, and my favorite - Nick Swardson, reprising his role as Terry the roller skating hustler - in Miami to make a record.

Now the movie was funny, but you have got to do yourself a huge favor and watch the Special Features. There are Public Service Announcements that are a hoot, as well as three feature commentaries: one with several of the actors as themselves, and then two different additional commentaries with the actors playing their characters.

Also, my favorite part of movies like this is just letting the comedians loose and seeing what they come up with. The extended scenes are un-freaking-real. The scene with Patton Oswalt and Mindy Sterling was hysterical - and it was all one take. The bus scene was also definitely worth watching."
647,4.0,"Destination X was a great ppv in 2007 from TNA. Most of all the matches are great and they all are pretty watchable. This ppv also ended the Sting and Abyss rivalry which took place in a brutal Last Rite's Match. Nearly a 5 Star ppv.

1. Ghetto Street Brawl
Latin American Xchange vs. Team 3D
Pheonomenal opener but I didn't understand why the titles weren't on the line here, but a surperb opening nevertheless. The teams fought all over the building, Team 3D even let some fans get some shots in on LAX. It turned out into an all out riot towards the end of the match with like 20 guys coming out and just fighting the holy hell out of each other. Great opening. Great hardcore action here. Shelly interfers and screws Team 3D. 4.5/5

2. Mixed Tag Team Bull Rope Match
James Storm & Miss Jackie vs. Petey Williams & Gail Kim
This bull rope match was quite interesting. Storm & Jackie gets some cheat shots in the beginning but soon after the tables are turned into Williams & Kim favor. Some pretty good comedic spots as well. The knockouts really dishes out some punishment to each other in this match, I really enjoyed watching this one. 3.5/5

3. Crossface Chicken Wing Match
Austin Starr vs. Senshi
Decent match here but you already know how the match was going to end, you had to win with Backlund's Crossface Chicken Wing in order to win which really didn't gave the the match any suspense but it was sill a pretty good x-division match up. 3.5/5

4. Voodo Kin Mafia vs. The Heartbreakers w/ Christy Hemme
Before the match started, VKM & Christy had a little comedic skit before the match which was a little funny, the BINGO thing was kind of stupid but the match wasn't all that bad. VKM really made this match. Some pretty nice reversals and a few impact moves. Christy interfered but she got hers. Nice tag match. 3/5

5. 2 out of 3 Falls Match for the X-Division Championship
Chris Sabin vs. Jerry Lynn
Terrific match, I was really impressed with Lynns endurance, he can really go out there and still put on a 5 star match. Some great wrestling moves were executed, some great counters and some great x-division action. The falls came at pretty good times as well and this was a great one on one confrontation. Some good outside ring action as well in the beginning. The interference by Daniels didn't hurt the match at all. Great x-division match up. 5/5

6. Elevation X
Rhino vs. AJ Styles
I wasn't really too fond of this match. It was kind of boring to me. But if yall haven't seen this type of match before, it does give you suspense of that someone will actually fall from the Elevated X 20 feet above the ring. Rhino is also able to pull off his Gore on Styles on top of the X but I wasn't really amused by this match. 2.5/5

7. Kurt Angle vs. Scott Steiner
I was impressed by this match too. I thought Steiner wouldn't have been able to do anything because hes so freaking big but he really shocked me. Steiner pulls off some good moves and even applying the olympic slam on Angle which it looked like it broke Angle's neck. The match was more of a brawl than anything but some wrestling moves were used as well. You even get some blood from Steiner. Pretty good match. I enjoyed watching this one too. 4.5/5

8. Last Rites Match
Sting vs. Abyss
This was TNA's version of a casket match. It got brutal at times as well. Abyss and Sting took some brutal shots in this one. Sting takes a viscious shot with the candlestick holder to head while trying to stinger splash Abyss. Sting also takes a hard chokeslam on top of the casket. Pretty violent match but not all that gory or anything of that nature but it was some/what violent. The fans did chant BORING at times but the match wasn't really boring at all. 4/5

9. NWA World Championship
Christian Cage vs. Samoa Joe
Pheononemal main event. Cage takes some viscious leg shots in this one by Joe. Some nice reversals and counters in this one. Good outside ring action as well. Cage takes a sickening slam on the floor, then gets taken to the crowd. Some great wrestling and some great brawling. Just some good hard shots in this one mixed in with some nice impacts moves too. Joe even utilizes the crippler crossface in this one which was great to see. Pheonomenal main event. It had a classic end as well. 5/5

Destination X was great. This is a great dvd to add to you collection This is one I defiantly on recommend on getting. Great TNA ppv."
648,1.0,This was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my life.  I'm an adult and I finally got tired of hearing EVERYONE talk about this movie for the last five years.  I am so sorry I wasted my money.  It wasn't worth watching and I wish I would have realized how freaking terrible it is.  There isn't even any hidden adult humor in it for parents.  Just awful.
649,5.0,"It came brand new and early as usual. Frozen is obviously one of the most popular kids movies in recent years and it's freaking everywhere. Little girls wear at least one piece of clothing Frozen in it. As for the movie itself, it's awesome. The songs are memorable, the plot is interesting and the characters are lovable. Overall, Disney fans should own this movie."
650,5.0,Okay as soon as I finished book one water I just add to run back to the store for book 2 earth is just so addicting. I freaking loved toft she is so badass. I loved watching this and see aang getting closer and closer to this destiny. Great family tv series about good vs evil and wrong vs right. I loved it so much. On to book 3 fire the last one sadness.
651,5.0,"With the latest anime movies I've seen before this being made in the mid-nineties, I had some low expectations when I ordered this from amazon. But I guess anime movies have come a long way since '95!

STORY
In a nutshell, Naruto and his squad are assigned the task of guarding an actress during the filming of her latest movie. But like all Naruto characters, this actress has some skeletons in her closet and it was only a matter of time until her past catches up with her.

The movie keeps the general flair of the series without getting too caught up in stuff like fight scenes. Like it's canon series counterpart, this movie does a good job of things like good back-stories and character development.

My only nitpicky complaint about the movie itself is that you could tell that the writers were trying to cram in every awesome attack there was available to the according characters (Kakashi and Sasuke's sharingan; Naruto's Mass Shadow Clones; even Sakura's evil side near the start of the movie!). The character designs for the bad guys and other movie-only characters are also not the best (the Princess' is probably the best out of all the new characters), but their back-story and weird quirks definitely make up for this.

Amazingly enough, this movie also fits in well into the series (as far as I know). Naruto's flashback in the series and Sasuke still being there shows that the movie is around the time right after Tsunade arrives in the village.

TECHNICAL STUFF
As for the animation, you can definitely tell that the movie got the royal treatment in that department. You can especially tell during the chidori/wolf scene. And, of course, like all current animated shows, the picture quality is beautiful. The background music also keeps most of the more memorable music from the series as well as some new tracks of their own.

One thing I was worried about when ordering this DVD was it's aspect ratio. See, the movie was originally filmed to be shown in theaters, so the aspect ratio is widescreen. Again, rest assured, that this release has the widescreen version as well, as opposed to being cropped to fit full screen TV monitors. And to make matters better, it's in anamorphic widescreen, meaning that if you've got a widescreen TV, the footage will automatically fit to the size of the screen (as in, without the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen). A much better option than the alternative of setting up your widescreen TV to zoom in to remove the black bars, but keeping the rest of the picture, since that would in turn cut off part of the subs and make the picture slightly fuzzy.

LANGUAGE TRACKS
Upon getting the movie today, I was most worried about the movie only having the dubbed version. Rest assured that there is a subbed Japanese version available. Now, I have close to no knowledge on the Japanese language, but it looks like the only changes made sub-wise were done for the sake of ""American-izing"" it (ie: having the subs read the first name before the last name and excluding suffixes like ""-san"" and ""-chan"") But nothing major.

And for those interested in the dub, based on the one scene I've seen of it, it looks like they've done a good job keeping close to the script and only making some changes for the sake of making the prose flow better and for the mouth movements to match up.

It definitely would have helped if they pointed out that both the dub and sub were available on the box art. Upon buying this, I was completely freaking out about whether this release had both versions or not!

EXTRAS
No way I would have given this release the full five stars if it didn't have at least one legit special feature-- a 10-ish minute short featuring Naruto and most of the other genin. The story's basically about Konohagakure holding a little tournament among the younger ninja. The only problem is that poor ol' Naruto's constipated and is forced to hold it in for the entire tournament.

The short is also available in dub and sub and is in widescreen, so I'm assuming this was played before the actual movie when shown in theaters in Japan (kinda like Pikachu's Vacation playing before the Pokemon movie). My only complaint with this is that unlike the movie itself, this short is NOT anamorphic, so your options to watching the sub while maintaining its aspect ratio (on a widescreen TV) are limited to 4:3 (full screen). Either that or you can have the screen stretch out or zoom in to remove those darn black bars. The problem with zooming in is that this means the subs will also be cut off slightly since well... it's not anamorphic. A slight pain, but still worthy of five stars.

WHY BUY IT?
You may be one of those fans who've downloaded this movie before Viz came around to distribute it here in the US... so you may be asking why you should buy it in the first place? Well, the way I see it, you're basically hurting the well being of the series if you don't! Downloading the episodes while they're available is one thing, but you should show your love for the series by buying the official releases once they're available on DVD. It's also always good to have a hard copy outside of your computer.

In conclusion, ""Naruto The Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Show"" is definitely worth the purchase, whether you're a subtitle or an English dub kind of fan. It's everything a fan would expect from the series meshed together into an hour and 35 minute movie."
652,5.0,it is ironic that I just started watching the series from 2008 what with the freaking phone code going on
653,5.0,"Dracula has been reinterpreted, bastardized, glamourized and rewritten so many times that it's hard to even identify him as the charming, monstrous boyar bloodsucker.

But the closest thing to a faithful adaptation is the BBC's 1977 miniseries ""Count Dracula"", which changes only a few details from Bram Stoker's original novel. Louis Jourdan is a little too polished to be a truly faithful Dracula, but excellent acting and some wonderfully atmospheric direction elevate this above virtually every other movie made about dear ol' Vlad.

Real estate agent Jonathan Harker (Bosco Hogan) arrives in Transylvania, to arrange a London house sale to the charming, mysterious Count Dracula (Jourdan). But Harker is increasingly troubled by bizarre specters and Dracula's odd behavior, leading him to believe that Dracula is not actually human.

Meanwhile, his fiancee Mina Westenra (Judi Bowker) worries about Jonathan's absence, even as her sister Lucy (Susan Penhaligon) gets engaged to rising young Texan Quincey (Richard Barnes). But shortly after a ship piloted by a dead man crashes nearby, Lucy begins acting strangely -- and becomes ill from a mysterious loss of blood, and strange fang marks appear on her throat.

Lucy's ex-suitor John Seward (Mark Burns) calls in his old teacher Dr. Van Helsing (Frank Finlay). Despite their best efforts, Lucy dies -- but not before showing a savage sensual side. It's only then that Dr. Van Helsing reveals the true, ghastly identity of what killed Lucy, and has turned her into an undead seductress: the vampire Count Dracula, who has somehow made his way to England. And now that he's targeting Mina, Van Helsing and the three young men must stop him.

""Count Dracula"" is probably the most faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, ever. It has a few minor changes (Arthur and Quincey are squished into one man), but but the rest of the story is lovingly faithful to the source. It even has little details that most movies overlook -- including the grotesque scene where Dracula hands over a baby as ""lunch"" for his brides.

At first the action alternates between cobwebbed stone passages of Castle Dracula and quaint Victorian seaside towns. But Dracula's shadow falls over them pretty quickly, and everything starts speeding up. Suddenly we have gory midnight stakings, crypts, dark forests, and across the Carpathian mountains. It all culminates in a wild chase across Transylvania, fighting gypsies and fending off the brides.

Director Philip Saville does a brilliant job here -- he's good at the staid drawing rooms you expect from the BBC period movies, but he's equally good at shadowed smokey forests.  There are some horrifically erotic bloodsucking scenes (sort of a vampiric date-rape), as well as some cute romances between the human lovers. And he loves to linger on Jourdan's eerier moments, like when Dracula lazily smiles at a hysterical Harker.

Saville also slaps in reversed color and misty, dreamlike camerawork, giving any scenes with vampiric powers an eerie, hallucinatory feeling. It's a slightly dated technique -- as is the climbing-down-the-wall scene -- but it doesn't really detract from the creep factor.

Jourdan is not quite the passionate looming Dracula that, say, Christopher Lee was. He's a little too calm, polished and French. But his Dracula is still very good -- charismatic, intelligent, and gives the impression of great age and maturity. And he's freaking creepy -- those bloody eyes, hairy palms and chilly masklike expression are all wonderfully eerie.

Frank Finlay also makes a truly magnificent Van Helsing, who's as smart if not as lethal as Dracula; Hogan, Bowker and Barnes all do an excellent job, and Penhaligan does a great switcheroo between the sweet Lucy and her wanton vampire self. And Jack Shepherd is a truly brilliant Renfield -- wild-eyed, twitchy, erratic, and prone to biting the male nurses, except when falling in love with Mina.

""Count Dracula"" is the single most faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic novel, and a solid horror movie in its own right. Definitely a must-see for those who appreciate Dracula as he should be."
654,2.0,"This movie's only a little over an hour long, but I swear it took a day to watch it. That's because the unnamed British narrator (who sounds like Kim Philby's twin) is so into his work as a Soviet propagandist, it's simply mind-boggling.

This Soviet 'documentary' (and I use that term VERY loosely) was made in the USSR and distributed to the US via a KGB movie outlet. Stalin's speechwriter apparently created the script, which is so ham-handed you feel like you're being slugged with a cast iron frying pan with every other breathless, exaggerated, fictional sentence.

Just about the only thing here that isn't padded with Soviet propaganda is the fact that Nazis were tried at Nuremberg.

If you know anything, and I mean anything, about the Soviet history - particularly Stalin's history - in WW2,  you'll be stopping this movie like I did. It's freaking unbelievable, the amount of utter BS! Nowhere does Kim Philby, errr, the narrator, mention that little Soviet-Nazi non-aggression pact. No mention of how Stalin, with his ally Adolf, marched into Poland and split it into pieces.

The most jaw dropping part is the breathless, naked hate against the Nazis, in almost every instance, could've been directed at Stalin himself. One example out of dozens: footage from Bylerussia, before the war. The narrator dramatically says, over pictures of pretty girls in Byelorussian dress and cornflower hair wreaths, ""Where are these girls now? [The Nazis] snatched them off the street. Families, children disappeared!"" Uh yeah, and so did any number of ethnic groups across the whole of the conquered Soviet territories during Stalin's various terror campaigns.. Somebody was filling up that enormous Siberian gulag - maybe the girl with the cornflower wreath?

This is worth two starts, simply for the blatant amount of Soviet BS and for some of the newsreel footage (you can skip over the parts where they hang on the various Nuremberg Nazis, with comments like, 'Look at that face! The fact of a murderer!' I kept waiting for the dastardly villain to jump out and twirl his black handlebar moustache, that's how antiquated and scenery-chewing this narration is.)

Make NO mistake: the Nazis were evil beyond compare. Until you remember that their first ally was the Soviet dictator who helped murder millions on his own dime."
655,4.0,"This collectors set is freaking psycho. If you like horror films and in all different types of horror, you will enjoy Rob Zombie. His wife is the pretty blonde and she's a good actress for these movies. One would think they're just psycho."
656,4.0,"I loved this show.  Everyone complains about dud episodes, but that is the beauty of an anthology series.  Everyone will like something different.  I loved Deer Woman, which managed to be funny but very suspenseful.  Pick Me Up features a freaking amazing performance by Michael Moriarty (from early seasons of Law and Order).  Absolutely top notch going against type portraying a serial killer trucker.  My wife's favorite episode was The Fair Haired Child, while we both got a kick out of the 'zombie movie for liberals': Homecoming.  Some very quirky performances from the two lead actresses in Sick Girl made that episode memorable for me and the premise of Jenifer had my wife talking about that episode for days.  I own both sets from season one, but like this set a little bit more overall."
657,5.0,"What you've heard is true- Bob Saget is, indeed, God! He is freaking hilarious in this. Who knew the dad of three cute girls in some dopey TV show could end up being so hilarious and wild onstage? He is a legend! Almost as funny as Carlos Mencia!"
658,5.0,Hilarious. Just freaking brilliantly hilarious.
659,5.0,"This here documentary presents possibly the most clear and concise account of the Six Day War, a conflict characterized by madcap lunacy and confusion that worked out great for Israel, due pretty much entirely to its air force.

The lead up to war is chronicled in fashion that clearly accentuates the Cold War politics that virtually caused the entire thing to begin with.  Aside from the many minor conflicts, skirmishes, attacks, and operations involving all the future players (Israel, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Palestine, etc), the most direct cause is given to the Soviet Union.

I'm unsure if the documentary was claiming or implicating (though it never did explain why) the Soviet Union into intentionally letting slip to Egypt and Syria false information that Israel was massing on the border with Syria plotting to invade.  Driven not at all by antisemitism and almost entirely by petty ""Stick it to the US"" political mentality (which is being sadly revived nowadays in Russia) the Soviet Union succeeded in freaking out the Arab countries, and spawning a self-fulfilling prophecy in which Arab nations from Syria to Egypt and Tunisia and Morocco joined together to crush Israel once and for all, retaliation for their defeat 20 years earlier.

This led to a massive rising amongst Syrians and Egyptians to strike at Israel first.  Particular emphasis is put on Nasser of Egypt, in his rallying the people to war with Israel.  When the US discovers these plans, the Soviets completely pull out their support for Egypt.  It then becomes a tragic farce when Nasser discovers that the Soviet intelligence was false, and now has the US and the USSR banding together trying to dissuade him from war, but by this time the warpath has been engaged and the Arab world is pressing relentlessly for war.

As time came and both sides faced off waiting for any little thing to provoke the conflict, Israel lost its nerve first.  Rather than foolishly lashing out, they brilliantly coordinated a series of pre-emptive air strikes that all but decided the war then and there, utterly crippling the Egyptian air force and ensuring that Israel owned the skies.

The ensuing war is described as a terrible clusterf-k in which both sides were driven as much by confidence in their own successes as by fear of their own predicaments.  The Israelis ended up taking so many prisoners, they had to release soldiers and keep only officers prisoner.  Undoubtedly, many died as they were basically forced to march back to the Suez, and others ended up dead, allegedly executed by Israeli soldiers.  It's even alleged that Nasser had some Egyptian stragglers flocking to the Suez killed to cover up the extend of Egypt's defeat.  The documentary makes no brazen claims unsubstantiated, though makes it very clear that Egypt lied to its allies in order to minimize chaos from rumors of defeat.

The Israeli offensive in the war led to their occupation of the Golan Heights, the West Bank, the Sinai, the Gaza Strip, and the entirety of old Jerusalem, of which Israel still holds Gaza, the West Bank, and all of Jerusalem even today, the basis for virtually all Israeli-Palestinian conflicts since then.

The documentary does a spectacular job of recounting the events of the war and portraying the confusion and panic associated on both sides, particularly the frayed nerves that led to Israeli jets firing on their own troops or Syrians rushing at Israeli troops to avoid aircraft fire.  While not passing any judgment on historical figures, Nasser comes across very favorably overall, emphasizing his early attempts to avoid war, and his post-war concession to the people of Egypt that they refused to accept.

The only thing missing from this is the USS Liberty incident, but that incident has been so thoroughly polarized and riven with controversy, the touchstone for antisemites and conspiracy theorists to spout their BS from, that it could warrant its own full length documentary.  An hour-by-hour rundown of the events only go further in supporting this documentary's atmosphere of confusion, paranoia, and anxiety, as communications broke down, banal decisions come back later to have severe consequences (such as removing the identified US ship from the radar screen because it was identified as non-hostile), and fears of provoking a nuclear standoff with Russia yet again (the aircraft initially sent to the Liberty's aid were armed with nuclear weapons, and recalled soon after their launch due to this concern) caused this debacle.  Going through the evidence myself, I am thoroughly convinced that this incident remains a heated controversy today due solely to antisemitism and/or anti-Israeli sentiment.

Problem?  Go in the toilet and argue.  I make no brazen accusations without good evidence, and don't automatically assume ""GUBMINT CUVRR UP"" if I can't find the evidence I may or may not want.  I have always found that no government on earth is even remotely competent enough to pull off those sorts of conspiracies and coverups."
660,4.0,"The individual versions of these may be going out of print.  For now they seem to be doubling them up.  At least there are future releases coming out.  Hopefully they will put out larger sets.  Anyway....

Even though it's not mentioned anywhere in this listing, this particular Goosebumps is a set of 2 episodes.  The first, It Came from Beneath the Sink, isn't overly scary and has a slight Gremlins feel to it.  Even though I'm in my 40s, I found it quite funny to watch the kids, who have just moved into a new neighborhood, as they discover something odd beneath the...you guessed it, SINK!  Is it really moving around scaring the dog?  Or is it just their imagination?  Quite fun finding out!  Now, the second story, Strained Peas, is by far my favorite.  It has a few real scares and may even be too much for a younger child.  You don't want any nightmares out of this.  Basically, a family with a preteen son have a new baby girl named Grace who is showing signs of not being completely innocent!  And the son is pretty much freaking out.

I'm plagued with being single and no children right now.  But these are still fun to watch by myself.  My guess is that these would be a perfect way to intro a kid to the fun of scary cinema with the whole family.  Sure, disturbing things happen but it's all nice in the end.  Main thing is the parent can watch it with the child and not get totally bored.  Or...you could watch Barney the dinosaur.  Now that's really scary!"
661,3.0,"I picked up some Midnite Movies classics from 20th Century Fox.  It's a two DVD set with two very strange horror science fiction films.  No extras in these films, except for theatrical trailers.

The first is Chosen Survivors.  The USA has set up several centers like fallout shelters throughout the country.  11 people for each center has been ""chosen by computer"" to be the best and brightest to restart the new world in about six months or so after the bomb drops.

We see these eleven guys and gals being ferried into a fancy elevator, all walking around like they were drunk or drugged.  Turns out they were given sedatives so that they could handle the shock of nuclear annihilation.

Oddly, none of these people knew that they were chosen in advanced.  Just thrown into this bunker with all the comforts of home.  Oh, and there was a maintenance man who happened to be doing a little fixing up and now he can't leave and is stuck with them.

The movie attempts horror with the bats.  Bats everywhere.  And even though the place is supposed to be sealed, bats get in anyway.  Naturally they are vampire bats and they try to suck the blood of everyone there.

Two women are basically nuts.  One screams incessantly, the other laughs hysterically.  Between the both of them, you need earplugs to get through the remainder of the film.

Jackie Cooper must have needed to pay the rent that week for this turkey, though he does a passable job as the rich guy who now is angry at everyone for doing this to him and suspects the government is somehow to blame.

Well, yeah, the government could not even plug up the holes to keep the bats out!  Damn!

The second in this dismal duo is the film The Earth Dies Screaming.  Produced by Robert L. Lippert, the man who also produced Rocketship X-M and The Last Man on Earth, it's about people dying around like flies and how aliens are moving in to take over.

The movie starts out great -- people die in their tracks with cars crashing and trains derailing, planes crashing, etc.  There are a few who survive.  And though they all blame a gas attack, that's never made clear.  It's also never made clear where these aliens come from, why they use robots to do their bidding, nor how they turn the dead people into zombies to do their bidding.  All very strange.

One of the characters in this play is very furtive and sneaky and freaks out when someone tries to burn ""worthless money.""  Why does he freak?  Does he know more than we do?  Never explained.

Willard Parker does pretty well as the American who is running the show for these sneaky, freaked-out English-people.

What really got me was this one gal who would run from the zombies but never closes the door behind her.  In one scene, the door even has a lock and she leaves it open and cowers in a corner.  Damn girl, lock the freaking door!!

A frustrating film, moves slow and is hampered by a silly script.  The acting however was quite well done and not too over the top.

663,5.0,"First I must tell the editor who wrote the review that I personally don't think any Latin guy who understands English will not laugh his guts out watching this. I was born in Cuba, and I am way beyond that ""politically correct cr@@p"". Although I would suggest one thing: next time any guy out there talks about us Cubans, please remember two things: 1) No, we DO NOT consume chili, jalapenos or whatever (that is a MEXICAN custom, not Cuban) and 2) We have no idea back in Cuba what a taco is. In fact, that for us, means a completely different thing; and a tortilla for us is an omelet, not some floury thing that, by the way, we again DO NOT know anything about back there. But then, enough of that, and let's give a huge round of applause for this guy. He is simply BRILLIANT. And for those of you Latin guys who go: ""Oh this is wrong, politically incorrect..""

From that point on, Price became a horror fixture starring in classics including (but not limited to)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fly/dp/B000RXVNDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fly</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-on-Haunted-Hil/dp/B001BSBBGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House on Haunted Hil</a>&nbsp;along with the original (and best) adaptation pf Richard Matheson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765318741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>, entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Man-on-Earth/dp/B001BSBBNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Man on Earth</a>.  Sadly, none of those films are featured in this set, but many of the lesser-known (see: not remade yet) gems of his career are so fear not.  While Price's onscreen persona was often villainous, menacing, and dour in real life he had a great sense of humor, once starting an eggfight on the set of Adam West's camp classic television series ""Batman"" where he played the villain Egghead.  He was also known as a gracious and humble man to work with who always answered every piece of fan mail he received personally.  There is no other person I'd personally rather see onscreen, there is no life form who did more for horror cinema in the 50's and 60's, and as far as I'm concerned there was never a better onscreen presence then Vincent Price.  Now, allow me to break down the individual films in this fantastic boxed set.

Edgar Allen Poe's ""Tales of Terror"" is an anthology of three tales taken from the macabre poet's catalog and brought to life by Vincent Price and director Roger Corman.  If there is one thing that even the most mathematically-challenged horror fan knows it's Poe + Price = awesome.  ""Morella"" is a chilling tale about a woman reuniting with the recluse father who abandoned her out of grief after losing his wife during childbirth. Naturally, there is a supernatural aspect and the reunion turns out less then great for father and daughter alike.  ""The Black Cat"" has been adapted many times with this one being the most comedic, but also arguably the most entertaining.  Frequent Price collaborator Peter Lorre plays a drunk whose hatred for his wife's cat will eventually be his undoing.  Price himself plays the wine connoisseur who bangs said wie after a hilarious taste-off featuring the horror legend at his hamiest.  ""The Fact s in the Case of M. Valdemar"" is the strongest of the three and terrifying indeed.  The story is of a man who finds that a person can be trapped in a state between life and death indefinitely through hypnosis after he entrances a man on his deathbed.  Insistent on interviewing the man -who can still communicate through a kind of telepathy- about his afterlife experiences indefinitely, the hypnotist ignores his and his wife's pleas to be released from his awful state.  The climax is horrifying and fitting.

On the flipside of very same disc we have ""Twice-Told Tales"", another anthology.  This one takes three tales from Nathaniel Hawthorne's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/short-story-collection/dp/0375757880/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">short story collection</a>&nbsp;of the same name.  That's SIX horror classic on the very first disc in this collection. Worth the price of the set by itself, really.  ""Heidegger's Experiment"" is a tale of betrayal that centers around two old friends who are made young again when they discover a fountain of youth of sorts.  But when they use it to bring back the love of their lives, the old cliche ""be careful what you wish for"" is in full effect.  ""Rappacini's Daughter"" is the story of a man who infects his daughter with a deadly poison that assures no man can ever touch her.  But a grown woman needs more then her father and the story of a girl who kills everything she touches is a tragic one.  ""The House of Seven Gables"" actually drags on quite a bit, but is still worth watching.  It's a typical story of greed and the sins of the father that revolves around a fortune hidden in a family's cursed ancestral home that was stolen from them by another family.  People from both clans show up to claim the hidden treasure, but nobody's going home happy.
3  stars

""Theater of Blood"" is a favorite Price flick of mine.  It's both scary in it's way and absurdly humorous and pays tribute to William Shakespeare every step of the way.  Price plays a deranged actor robbed of his perceived rightful prize at an award show by a panel of judges, who gave the award to an upstart.  I see the film as a tongue-in-cheek message to film critics to respect their betters.  He begins slaughtering the critics by staging famous death scenes from Shakespeare plays with himself providing the performances and a crew of fans (and paid bums) taking care of the logistics.  The cracked performances that result evoke more than a few laughs.  I'll never get the image of Price in a baker's hat re-enacting ""Titus Andronicus"" -where a queen is fed her own children in a pie- by feeding an effeminate man his beloved poodles using a funnel.  There is also trampoline fencing, an afro, and a reference to Price's character's performance betwixt two up-and-coming actors as being reminiscent of a ham sandwich.  The whole thing is like something out of some insane comic book.
5 stars

""Madhouse"" is on the flipside of the same disc, and is sort of a tribute to Price himself.  It features several classic clips from his filmography which are attributed here to his character Paul Toomes, whose trademark role is as the murderous Doctor Death.  Along with Peter Cushing, Robert Quarry co-stars in this and actually appears at a Halloween party dressed as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Count-Iorga/dp/B0007R4T0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Count Iorga</a>, which is a very funny treat for 70's horror fans.  Naturally, the troubled Toomes starts having people die around him in ways similar to his movies and it seems that his Doctor Death alter-ego has taken on a life of his own.  Great Price film.
4  stars

 ""The Abominable Doctor Phibes"" is a revered Price classic and with good reason.  It follows the ingenious murders of the title character, who is bent on revenge after his wife dies during a botched surgery.  There were nine members of the surgery team when she died and he creatively uses the ten plagues of Egypt to see that they meet their end with the help of his mute vision of beauty, Vulnavia (Virginia North).  Phibes himself cannot speak save for a device he invented that he plugs into his neck that allows him to vocalize using a phonograph.  Hearing Price's bone-chilling voice coming from a character whose lips never move is pretty discomforting, as is his silent surveillance of his handiwork.  The deaths in this are sweet and so is the music.  Phibe's flamboyant organ-playing and mechanized accompaniment (Dr. Phibe's Clockwork Wizards) also add a unique ambience to the proceedings.  The moment where Phibes reveals his true face is one of my favorite moments from a horror film.
 5 stars

On the other end of the spectrum (and the other side of the disc) is the lame sequel ""Doctor Phibes Rises Again"", which strikes me as a creatively bankrupt cash-in.  Any logic or originality from the first film quickly evaporates and the viewer is treated to all sorts of stupidity.  First off, Vulnavia is summoned out of thin air and is played by a different (no less alluring) actress.  No explanation.  Secondly, Phibes sets up his hideout complete with clockwork band IN AN EGYPTIAN PYRAMID.  Why?  Then there's the fact that Phibes ""talks"" constantly.  Any creepiness from the usually mute character vanishes the second he plugs his speech device into a freaking tuba held by Vulnavia. One starts to wonder how Phibes rolls his R's so well when he is speaking without using his tongue. When there is no tuba handy, we are forced to listen to his thoughts.  It becomes very annoying.  There are plenty of kills, and Robert Quarry co-stars as Phibe's rival to obtain the secret of the pharaoh's immortality so it's still mandatory viewing, but there is just too much ridiculousness in ""Doctor Phibes Rises Again"" to let it rise past the level of mediocre.  There were originally more sequels planned.  Thank God they never got made.

""Witchfinder General"" may not be the best-known film in this set, but it arguably the most significant.  Butchered and released in America as ""The Conqueror Worm"" in a weak attempt to tie it to Edgar Allen Poe.  In fact, the DVD case still bafflingly reads ""Edgar Allen Poe's Witchfinder General"". Anyhow, this is the real deal uncut version complete with original score and it is wonderful. It was possibly the 60's film that inspired the 70's grindhouse era of horror cinema.  It is considered the most brutal horror picture produced in it's time and is certainly an integral part of any Vincent Price collection. Price's ice-cold performance as real-life witchhunter Matthew Hopkins is unique and was inspired by wonderkid director Michael Reeve's animosity towards the star during shooting. Not only does this film feature women being raped, hanged, drowned, beaten, tortured, and burned alive, but it also has a blunt axe murder that has to be seen to be believed. The tale is of a very uncomfortable and corrupt period in British history, and the view is very unpleasant as a whole.  Definitely not a typical Price flick. The scary thing is, no film has ever dared to examine the true extent of the evils brought about by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Malleus-Maleficarum/dp/1585090980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Malleus Maleficarum</a>.  Let's just say that the torture and live burnings seen in films are sugar-coated compared to the even more sadistic reality.  Mankind is a very sick species.  The disc features a commentary and a lengthy featurette on the making of the film.
5 stars

So that's it: the man, the myth, the legend, and a whole bunch of his films.  Also included in the set is the ""Disc of Horrors"" which features three excellent featurettes (about an hour total) about Vincent Price's life, times, friends, and films with one focusing on the films in this set.  All-in-all a hell of a deal.  If you don't already own these films, now's the time.  And while I'm here let me point out that it's a crime that there is still no DVD release for ""Diary of a Madman"".  Happy Haunting!"
666,5.0,"This is a heavy metal music/horror movie and is totally awesome, after making a deal with the devil for fame and success a rock bank ( Black Roses ) comes to town unbeknownst to the nice town folk they are demonic. They travel around from place to place performing, spreadind evil, corrupting teens, and reekting havoc gaining themselves power, popularity, fame, and big time success. It soon becomes the task of a teen guy to battle them and save the town

For example you have the pretty sweet innocent wouldn't hurt a fly blond girl next door who after listening to their music turns into a gorgeous sexy temptress dressed in black and kills someone, other teens transform in various ways This film features music by ( Lizzy Borden, song Me Against The World ) and other rock performers, I freaking love the music in this. Another one is ( Trick Or Treat ) starring Tony Fields as the singer who does a satanic ritual, later on dies in a fire, a kid buys their album and starts playing it backwards a voice starts telling him how to get revenge on his bullies he does, 1 cool special affect is ightening shoots out of his guitar. This is another Heavy Metal Music/Horror masterpiece it is perfect with this one"
667,3.0,"Renner steals the show, this was almost a good movie. The first one is probably a little better. I think they tried to avoid cliches and instead ended up just making everyone look stupid.
The best was Jeremy renner who was hilarious in this, I normally don't like him in most movies but here he was great. He was out of place a bit in that he to me he just stole every scene. Spoilers....

And so he doesn't make it through to the end probably they wanted to surprise us but really he was the only really likeable person here. The kids were a weird plot device doing absolutely stupid stuff just to move the plot forward. They escape and take huge risks over a bridge and go to a dangerous quarantined area where everyone was a zombie . Check. To get a picture . Check.that maybe they could have waited and gotten in a couple months. Check. And everyone dies because of this unbelievable and idiotic thing. Check. Well at least their done doing stupid things. Not hardly they are just getting warmed up.

The then what's with the dad will see some famous actor they didn't want to waste because I had them have a couple parts in the beginning that were sort of interesting and that he was a coward which was kind of surprise but then they have essentially hang around the rest of the movie and keep showing up in the matter where they win they magically appear there is this super zombie not sure why but it made it less believable if you know what I mean

 I like how the militaries code red was so easily I fail fail. But the ultimate ridiculous blooper was watching the dad as he used to security card to open each door in succession  One by one until he finally gets to the mother while the general is talking to the everyone else you mean to tell me that the military doesn't even bother to guard the door yet they have all  this resources and planning behind everything in this huge control room that was a little hard to swallow
The mom being immune was kind of a fun twist essentially  The carrier I guess they tried to surprise us by having the dad kill her which honestly made no sense though how did she not get killed earlier in the movie when there was like five people in the room with her they were all diseased and crazy it appears that they would've killed her based on how the dad acted

 How about when the boys upstairs in the house and yells for a sister and she says nothing for no apparent reason all the mom is freaking out eating tunafish and kitty litter it was one stupid thing after another with all the wrong kinds of surprises I give us a three out of five which I believe is generous I like Jeremy Renner there so she was pretty dang funny but overall I wish I had not watch this movie and I believe that sums it up"
668,4.0,"Where to begin...Ah yes....I really liked this sequel because I HATE reality shows, like Survivor.  The people are so freaking annoying and come off as complete idiots. This movie takes a reality show where the contestants are practically on the doorstep of the mutant family, and the contestants meet grisly ends (which is whet I wish would happen to most of the people that are on all the reality shows on TV now.....). As with any movie she id in, Crystal Lowe takes off her clothes to show off her incredible body, which just like my review for Wrong Turn 3,adds an extra star to my rating. Ms. Lowe is a lovely girl, and plays her part perfectly. Yes, lots of bad acting, but this is worth a rental for sure."
669,2.0,"One week later after watching this movie and I am still disappointed in it. Although I should have known it would be bad, because the first one was so freaking good. This movie, as other reviewers have pointed out, has too many points in it that I you are saying ""no way that would happen"" and you are too preoccupied about that to even care about what is happening on screen with the characters or plot. I didn't care about anyone surviving, because they were all idiots. The Father who kisses his obviously infected exposed wife, the two kids who sneak out to get photographs knowing that in time they would probably get them anyway, the soldiers and the doctor who have no common sense between them. I think I was harboring a secret fantasy that the little boy would get torn to shreds, because his behavior and downright stupidity made me frustrated. Who falls down stairs/escalators and just gets up and wanders off from there? Wouldn't you stay where you fell? The same ""Godspeed you black emperor"" song from the first movie, also made me mad, I guess they had to use it to tie it to the first, but to me it only reminded me how UNLIKE the first movie it really was! I actually snickered when the infected were running around France at the end, Le Rage Oui Oui!  I really want to one day take all the over acting infected shots and set them to music, maybe Barry Mani lows Copacabana?
I would say only see this movie, to appreciate how awesome the first one was all over again, and than go watch the first one to erase the memory of this sequel."
670,2.0,"So, I did the dumb thing and read the short story just before watching the movie, so take that into account when reading this review.
The movie itself was watchable, if a little disjointed and somewhat hard to follow, but saying that it's based on Kings story is more of a cruel joke than an accurate description.
Two characters in the book made it into the movie, but since they were the only two chacters in the book (the writer and the hotel manager), it would have been impossible to leave them out.  Apart from that, I counted 3 vague references to the book.  3.
The film makers added several chacters, presumably for us to hate.  The ex-wife made me want to punch her in the face within 2 minutes of being on screen.  When your ex calls you, obviously freaking out and tells you to call the police and save his life, you don't start whining about how he didn't call you when he got into town.  She was begging to be hated, which seems to be the only reason she was in the movie - because trying to build a background for the writer failed miserably.
Then starts this whole thing where the room tries to convince him he seeing his dead daughter, and he starts to lose it.  again, adding characters to the story that weren't needed.
I'm just disgusted with this movie.  The book made the room a truely malevolent entity.  The movie made it a kinda creepy and surreal place to be, it was so watered down if I didn't know it was based on the book I never would have recognised it.  The stupid film didn't even get the pictures on the wall right!!!!
Things that really pissed me off because it wasn't supposed to happen: He left the room (at least he thought he did), he interacted with other people while in the room, he was able to contact people outside the room, he crawled around the freakinig vents and found a dusty corpse that of course (in crappy, predictable movie fashion) came to life and chased him through the ducts, the list could go on for as long as the movie, which seemed endless.
Honestly, it was such a struggle to watch the last half hour, I didn't think I would get through it, but I had to see how much more the film makers could screw up the story - and on that point they take the cake, all of the cake, even the crumbs.
Then the writer dies at the end, which wasn't supposed to happen, and the story was much more disturbing knowing that for the rest of his life he had to sleep with the lights on so when he woke from his nightmares he instantly knew he was not in that room any more.
John Cusack delivers an amazing performance, and is really the reason to watch this movie, the only reason.  He is believable, genuine, and with all the other things I hated about this film, I still found him compelling.
Sam Jackson was good as well, but his character was poorly written and in no way resembled a hotel manager.

Conclusion:  Skip the movie and read the story.  (Don't worry, America, it's a short story)"
671,5.0,"How do you rebound from a cliff hanger like Marshall and Lily breaking up? Right where you left off.

Season two starts moments after we learn about the split with Barney and Robin rushing to Marshall's side. I love that they let the break up go on for a while and didn't opt for a quick one episode fix. Therein lies a big reason I feel that the show is so wildly successful, because they explore real situations. They realize break ups hurt and they let Marshall hurt...and hurt...and hurt some more. All the while his friends rally around him to help him try and forget, or at least not dwell on, what happened. In classic HIMYM form, some very funny results ensue, from Barney taking him to a strip club to Ted taking him to a baseball game (ending with Marshall freaking out on a newly engaged couple) and Robin, of course, taking him to the gun range.

Now that's not all that happens. Of course, Robin and Ted are officially an item so we get ample comedy from them. Lily comes back from San Francisco to commence a funny round of apartment hunting. Ted finds out his parents got a divorce. And Barney...well, Barney does what Barney does best, chases women. All of that leads up to Marshall and Lily's wedding.

Their wedding could've been handled in so many different ways, and it could've failed in so many ways. However, they cover the wedding over the span of two episodes. Everything from pre-wedding jitters to how everything will always go wrong, to their own private ceremony headed by none other than Barney. They did it perfectly.

All in all, season two builds upon what season one started in all the right ways. There are no midseason lulls, only laughs offered throughout. With huge heart and a wonderful cast there's nothing missing."
672,3.0,"""Zombies on a Plane""--""Dead Flight""--""Drop Dead Flight""--the possibilities for alternate titles for Scott Thomas' ""Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane"" is endless. The film is insanely goofy and while it couldn't exactly reach the B-movie charms of ""Snakes on a Plane"", it is still a fun watch for those lazy night evenings when there is nothing good on TV.

In a transatlantic flight, a secret agency is transporting the corpse of a woman who is the carrier of a man-made virus. The weather isn't very good to make such a flight, there is a thunderstorm, turbulence is aplenty which eventually results on zombies literally running rampant in a plane at 130,000 feet. Cue, sexy flight attendants, a comedic convict, two tough guys and even a nun to save the day....but how do you fight an horde of the undead when there is nowhere to go?

""Snakes (ahem) Flight of the Living Dead"" is a zany gorefest, and very humorous in its execution. True, the opening act of the film is rather boring with the introduction of boring and dull characters; surfer dudes with their bimbo girlfriends, the smooth talking con accompanied by a federal agent, sexy and lusty flight attendants, a professional golf player and his wife, mad scientists who are bent on changing the world for profit and a nun. The film's characters are very clichd and quite uninteresting. The film's main premise is very similar to ""Snakes on a Plane"" but sadly, the film has no nudity and only hinted at sex.

Thankfully, after the corpse escapes the coffin, the film goes into overdrive. There is a lot of visual blood and gore, and while the violence is more funny than scary most of the time, well, the film is never boring and proves quite entertaining in a goofy way. The smooth talking convict is responsible for most of the film's goofy banter and the humorous touches with the zombie attack just made me laugh my socks off. A grandma zombie with no teeth, umbrella attack and zombie who never figures out how the seatbelt works is just freaking hilarious, among other stuff.

The zombies themselves are visceral looking and they look very bestial and fast-moving; nope they are not like the zombies in the classic Romero films but more like the ones in ""28 weeks Later"". The film never makes any attempts for cheap scares, the film is fast-paced and more an action film than anything else. The one issue I have with ""Flight.."" is that the filmmakers seemed poised to take itself seriously in the first half with the boring and shallow character development. Truth be told, no viewer who would sit through ""zombies on a 747"" would care for any of those factors. The film also has a less-than stellar cast made up of Dale Midkiff, Erick Avari, Richard Tyson, David Chisum, Kevin J. O'Connor, and Kristen Kerr. Then again, what A-list actor would be caught in a movie like this? I mean this in a good way.

There is zero suspense to be had and the film offers no surprises. It doesn't seem necessary to shoot the zombies here in the head--as an Air Marshal says: ""two in the chest and one in the balls.."" is quite sufficient. The film is not to be taken seriously and it is definitely a lot of fun to watch. There is a lot of overused elements here but who cares? A zombie take on ""Snakes on a Plane"" may not be deep or worthy of an Oscar, but no one can deny that the film is a lot of fun.

Fasten your seatbelts, folks, and leave your brain at home, you going in for a ride!
Undead Airlines is taking off on its maiden flight!  I doubt if this movie is worth repeated viewings, but you will enjoy parts of it.

Recommended![3 Stars]"
673,4.0,"I have read the original novel by Alexandre Dumas and seen a few of the adaptions that were made in the past.  I loved the book more because it always had a beautiful story to tell.  It was satisfying, dark, compelling, and even heartfelt as well.  I consider the novel to be better than the movie.  The storyline is freaking huge and even the characters are all developed as well.

When I first heard of ""Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo"", I almost felt like Hollywood had done it again and ruined another adaption of the famous novel that has entertained me.  But once I started watching the very first episode, I was hooked from that moment to all the way to the end.  I even finished all 24 episodes within one night (due to them only being 23 or 24 minutes long).  I was very impressed with the graphics and how they are able to capture a lot of stuff.  I know that it is an anime tv series, which is very popular in Japan, but in truth, I have always loved anime.  At least Japan knows how to due their movies.

The series is about the Count of Monte Cristo, only told in a more futuristic version this time.  Instead of Edmond Dantes being the main protagonist, we have Albert Morcerf playing the role as the main guy.  It also takes a point of view on everyone else and also how others suffered the collateral damage of Edmond Dantes's revenge against those who betrayed him many years ago.

I really loved how the whole tv series centers around Albert Morcerf instead of Edmond Dantes, it offers a new point of view and even a lot of mystery to the Count of Monte Cristo, despite that those who are familiar with the novel and other adaptations already know more about the backstory that has led to this moment.  Albert is really kept true to his original counterpart in the novel.  We even get to meet a few other characters from the novel as well, especially those who haven't appeared in the movie adaptions.  Characters like Mercedes, Valentine, Maximilien, Eugenie, Franz, and a dozen others are designed very well and put into roles for the story, allowing them to develop and play a part in the series.  Other small time characters Haydee, Ali, Bertuccio, Baptistin, Luigi Vampa, Julie Herbault, Emmanuel Herbault, and also Benedetto are expanded in the series.  And finally, we get to my favorite part, the villains!  As usual, we have the evil trio Fernand Mondego (aka Count de Morcerf), Baron Danglars, and Grard de Villefort back for more rounds.  However, other characters like Abbe Faria, Jacopo, Peppino, and also Bartolomeo Cavalcanti have been omitted.

The one thing that I love most about this anime tv series is that it is well-paced and well put together.  The storyline does a great job at remaining true to the original novel in its own way.  It has that same atmosphere that the novel once had, with a few minor adjustments and a few new ideas to put into place.  Even the graphics are just amazing.  The characters really play their part very well.  I have to say that this is the greatest adaption of the Count of Monte Cristo ever!

(WARNING: Major Big Time Spoilers Ahead):

The creation of the unknown entity, Gankutsuou, really added something new to the whole story and also a more evil presence.  Even other new ideas like Albert and Eugenie falling in love really do add more excitement and drama to the series.  I also love how we also go deep into Mercedes and how her love for Edmond (aka Count of Monte Cristo) hasn't changed and that she is still and always will be in love with him.  The villains of this story really make this all worth while and help us see the corruption that exists in series and in our world today.  I also love how the Count is portrayed as more vengeful than he is in the novel or any or the adaptions.  And lets not forget the music.  I really love how the music just fits right in with the emotional moments of the series, allowing us to feel the excitement, sadness, and also happiness when it is needed.  The deep friendship between Albert and the Count is done very well too.  It does so well than the book des and allows us to feel for both of them.  I will admit, this is a beautiful tv series and I consider it the best adaption of the Count of Monte Cristo!

However, I do have some issues with the series as well.  There was nothing wrong with the first two acts of the series, they were done extremely beautiful and even the major battle at the very end was just exciting and heartfelt.  But the one problem that I had with the ending was that the Count of Monte Cristo dies.  I couldn't really see the point in that.  With Franz, I can see how his death really makes sense, because his death represents how things are changing and that the Count has gone too far with his vengeance.  But with the Count's death it just didn't feel right to me.  I do love that Albert breaks the bond between Edmond and Gankutsuou, but the fact that he dies doesn't feel like the type of ending I would have went with.  I was hoping that Edmond would finally forgive Fernand and reunite with Mercedes, creating a more satisfying ending for the fans of Edmond Dantes.  The guy has had a tough life and the world wants to see him finally happy.  Either that or a little less vengeful.  I also question why a lot of the characters weren't really present at the final battle of the series or at least not shown.  It just felt like something was missing and I realized that a lot of the characters who were present throughout the series weren't shown at the last battle.  But that's just my opinion.

Another issue that I thought the series really missed was how the Count of Monte Cristo found his treasure and became rich.  If any of you read the book or seen the movies we know that the Count found the treasure with help of Abbe Faira's map, a fellow prisoner from the same prison that Edmond was at, and discovered his wealth on the island of Monte Cristo.  In the series, we don't even get an answer on how he got his wealth at all.  Sure, it is questioned by a few of the characters, but it is never explored.

I also had a problem with the very end of the series, the final part that wraps up the storyline.  It jumps five years ahead, showing that things have changed and that others are trying to move on.  I love that Valentine and Maxilimien are happily in love and living their lives together. I also love that Haydee, along with fellow servants of the Count, are living their lives with happiness as well.  But I was left a little unsatisfied with the endings for Mercedes, Albert and also Eugenie.  We know that Mercedes misses and still loves Edmond, despite what he has done, but I can't find myself moving on from how things end with her.  It feels like unfinished business, like a loose end.  We obviously know that Albert and Eugenie are going to reunite and get married, except that we are left wondering how they reunite!  The ending to this series isn't horrible or bad, it just doesn't create that satisfying atmosphere that needs to be created.  Even the Dark Knight had a better conclusion than this.  But then again, that's just my opinion.

All in all, this is a great tv series!  Despite the dissatisfying ending, this tv series really holds up and does a great job at remaining true to a lot of the elements in the novel.  A lot of the characters' fates are pretty much the same, just done in a whole new way.  Some characters have a different fate from how it is in the novel.  I consider this tv series to be the best adaption of the Count of Monte Cristo ever!  It is beautifully written, the drama is heartfelt, the music is awesome, the graphics are great, and the characters are just amazing!  It even has a more dark theme to it than the novel did.  But like I said, this is just an amazing anime tv series!

I vote that this is worth buying!  I totally recommend it!  Great classics like this only come once in a lifetime!"
674,5.0,"This is a good DVD for BEGINNERS. I realize that is what the title says,but even if you have been dancing for a while, you want to learn new techniques for peforming. That is why I bought this. I have been dancing a while now and even though I'm intermediate, I bought this thinking that it might teach me something new. It is a good DVD if you are majorly sweating your first performance,or if you want to put on a show for someone. But if you are not new to the dance it won't teach you much that you don't already know.
If you are a beginner, BUY THIS. It is a good DVD. If you are an intermediate and have never performed before BUY THIS. It will help you understand the structure of a show. If you have performed more than once,and have taken for more than three years from a good teacher,it will probably be stuff you already know. So be a doll and pass it on to the  new kid in class who is freaking out because she is performing for the first time."
675,5.0,I loved this movie. It was freaking hilarious. If you can find the humor in a zombie named Fido and treated like a house pet who may accidentally eat someone here and there you will love this movie. It was very well made and it is obvious a decent budget was put on this movie.
676,5.0,The set is freaking awesome. This season is even better than the first. It is one of the few shows that my entire family loves. We can wait to get the third season.
677,2.0,"It was never funny. You are the music in Me was WACK. And the dialogue bored me to tears. Ashley, Zac, Vanessa, Corbin and Lucas, spare me you has-beens. Zac and Vanessa are one of the hottest couples I've ever seen in my entire life but that still doesn't mean that they don't participate in the creation of fodder-filled products!

I hate how these celebrities make money from these brainless adults and the no-talent-loving children who support this corporately-kiddy pappy pap. I don't understand how these teens (besides Zac (20?) and Ashley, who's she's freaking 22 already!) just perform other people's crappy tunes. Ugh.

I am SO tired of them all. Corbin writes about Homework (*LOL*) and Vanessa coos her way through R&B-wannabe Pop tart music. And did you HEAR her sing that terrible song when she broke up with Zac and was on a bridge or something?? It made my ears wince in pain. She's a crappy singer, and I don't know who she had to make out with to get a record deal but she really, REALLY needs to step up her game and at least co-write 2 or 3 songs to get an ounce of my respect.

I HATE all of you (minus Zac) and wish you would go away.

The sooner the very better!

678,5.0,"People like to compare ""remakes"" to originals with just cause, but really this movie has quite a bit to offer.
It's got some the greatest horror icons from the last 30+ yrs:

Malcolm McDowell, William Forsythe, Danielle Harris, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Clint Howard, Dee Wallace, Ken Foree, and Sid Haig.

With some great characterization from new comers Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, Sheri Moon Zombie, Skyler Gisondo and Jenny Gregg Stewart (plays young Lindsay Wallace, who will blast your ears off with her freaking screams geez!).

This is brutal an raw if you want pg-13 horror look away, its got enough cuss words to rival Scarface and more than enough blood and gore to satisfy even Jeffrey Dahmer's eclectic tastes.

Like it or hate it is different, the basic structure is there but that's what made Halloween ""Halloween"" it'd be like Friday the 13th without the lake and counselors.

Watch a new spin on an old classic and take it for what it is; a homage, a re-imaging, and most of all a good time."
679,3.0,"This week we, Sid the Elf, decided to review the remake or whatever of the greatest horror film ever, Halloween. Now, we knew that this film was done by the ever-creepy Rob Zombie so we realized going in that things had a chance to get wierd or stupid but this one was ridiculous. It was a remake of the classic, kind of but not really. And the parts that were the same as the original were different here. Sounds confusing? Well how about watching this in an altered state trying to figure it out?

The bulk of the film concentrated on Michael Myers's early life and his rise to the top of the world of serial killing. The funniest parts of this movie came in the section where the evil stepdad was making fun of a young Myers calling him a freak and questioning his sexuality while Myers stands there taking it while wearing a homemade mask. It doesn't get much funnier than that. You also had young Myers making the ""I want to wrestle you so freaking bad"" face whenever anyone made him mad. Well, when he wasn't wearing one of his little masks. That was great. Also, young Myers offered us a couple of freakouts. The one when he went off on Loomis was awesome. If this movie was not a remake of a classic, and stood on its own, it would have made a pretty good horror B as all the elements were there. However, when you look at this film as the remake that it was, it fell way short.

First, Sid would like to talk to you about Loomis. In the original, he was the best part about the film. Who could forget such classic lines as, ""Tell your men to keep their eyes open and their mouths closed,"" along with many others. In the remake Loomis offered nothing, he had the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. He even exploited Myers's psycosis by writing a book and going on a speaking tour over it. Then, there was Laurie. In the first film, she was sweet and innocent and you really did not want Myers to catch her. This was one of the things that made the original. In the new version, she was trashy and annoying. Sid was hoping they would change the ending and have Myers strangle her by the 30 minute mark. Finally, there was Myers. In this one, he was a giant goon, which does explain his freakish strength and adds a lot in the way of unintentional comedy. But, he was so goofy. Sid even joked that Kane was playing him, only to find out that it was actually a more b wrestler that we'd never even heard of! Big Sky is the guy's name for the record.

So, this film was ok at best. That's factoring in all the unintentional comedy by goofy Myers, young Myers, and the stepdad; and the um, comedic mood Sid was in. Apperances by Clint Howard and Danny Trejo helped ease the pain a little. Oh, and the few times the film featured ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" was a pretty cool nod to the original and to more cowbell. But, Zombie's version concentrated too much on the gore of Myers' killings and his disturbed past really trying to drive home the fact that this man is totally insane. Yeah, we kind of got that by the huge killing spree, but I guess when you're Rob Zombie that's not really enough to classify someone as off the reservation. This one is probably only worth checking out if you've never seen the original and want to settle in with a decent horror B or if you just want to make fun of fat young Myers for a little bit. All in all 3 stars, not great, not bad. It insists upon itself, I like The Money Pit."
680,1.0,"This movie was absolutely horrible. I am such a big fan of the original version, but this one made me want to cry.

When I think of Halloween, there are many things that should have been incorporated into the movie. First, the scene where Micheal wears a sheet and glasses (which he does in this movie). Everything else was missing. There sould have been a scene where Laurie was in the closet and Micheal tried to get her. One other important thing is only being able to see his mask, as if it were floating in mid air. No scenes like this. Instead, they make him to be more like Jason from Friday the 13th. I love the Friday the 13th franchise, but his is Halloween. Micheal lurks in the shadows and surprises his victims, he does not use brute strength to tear through everything to get to the victim. I enjoyed the backstory idea, but I didn't like how they made his family trailer trash.

I really liked the young girl who played Laurie Strode. I am really happy that Rob Zombie did not make her like she was in the original version. In all honesty, there is no 17 year old girls like that in 2007. I am glad he made her spunky instead of Amish.
I also really liked how the mask was all aged and dilapidated. These were the only two good parts of the movie.

One things that really bothers me is that I felt like I was back in freaking 1972 throughout the entire movie. Every single male character had long hair. I thought they were all in a bad 1970 rock band. I understand that the movie probably starts out in the 80's, so the long hair would be expected. But when it is in present day, come on. Every single movie that Zombie makes is like a freaking music video because all the guys are like rock stars with long hair. THIS IS 2007.

Another things that bugs me is, yet again, this movie has the same cast from House 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. I honestly have not seen another movie with these actors in it, and there is probably a good reason for that: THEY CAN'T ACT. The exception is Sherri-Moon Zombie. I actually really liked her in this movie. But the rest, come on. They are freaking Z-List celebrities.

And lastly, I do not consider this a horror movie. I consider this a porn movie with Micheal Myers as a side character. Every five minutes there is a sex scene with naked women running around. It was so gross. Even the scene when Micheal escapes the sanitarium is because of a gross sex scene. (which I don't understand why the two men wish to do what they did to the poor woman in Micheal's room. This was a very weak scene.) Almost all of the main characters that die in this movie die right after or during having sex. The sex scenes overshadow the gore scenes. I mean, Micheal will be in the middle of killing someone, and suddenly it skips to a sex scene. When we come back, there is blood EVERYWHERE, and we don't get to see how this happened. I would much rather see the blood shed, and less porn. I mean, if I wanted to see a porn movie, I would rent one.

This movie was complete and utter trash. I really want everyone to watch the original Halloween instead of this stupid movie. Although, if you are in for a good porn flick, then I'd rent this one. But beware, the people in this movie aren't that attractive to look at!"
681,5.0,"So far everyone of Rob Zombie's movies have sucked in my mind, but this one. It took Zombie 3 years to make this movie what it is, a true masterpiece! If you asked me what me favorite scene was in the movie I would say, I don't have one... because the whole dam movie was freaking assume! I can't wait till this comes out onto DVD in December, I hope it gets a two disc special unrated release!"

683,2.0,"This is a weird freaking movie. The only redeeming quality is that Ford is as yummy as ever. I think this movie may have some value in a timeline with other films but honestly, even though everyone says it's great, I just don't see it. It's weird and boring.

The spandex and/or Ford might keep your attention, but the plot won't."
684,1.0,"There's a big difference between Art and Story. The two do not necessarily preclude each other, but in movies, filmmakers tend to favor the latter over the former. This has resulted in wave upon wave of horrible film, granted. However, favoring the former over the latter hasn't resulted in any great shakes, either. In fact, both extremes often end with bewildered or annoyed audiences. However, when a story-based film fails, detractors have a much better time of it, because you can point to plot holes, inconsistent or incomplete characters, cheesy dialogue, or pure cliche. When an ""artsy"" film fails, however, the explosive force between its fans and haters gains extra force because, bottom line, it comes down to taste. Likewise with this film. It has as many glowing reviews as nasty reviews, and the bottom line isn't about the beauty, artistry, or skill of the film. It's about whether or not you believe depression can be an art form. I do not.

MELANCHOLIA, as a film, is almost exactly what it sounds like. It is a 136-minute-long gaze at depression. And that's it. Seriously. No, seriously.

Do you want a story? Well, fine then. How about this? A sister planet to Earth is discovered. It is named Melancholia (oooh!) and it is headed straight for Earth. If the two planets collide, then the entire human race is doomed. Also, a girl is getting married and she's very sad. The end.

Does it seem like I'm exaggerating? I am absolutely not. Kirsten Dunst plays one of the most annoying characters of her career (and that's saying a lot). She is part of a wealthy family on a wealthy estate that is holding a wealthy wedding between her and some other wealthy people. Inexplicably, she's depressed beyond words. The movie never explains why. ""Why"" is not the film's motif. Instead, it patiently and lovingly follows its tortured heroine as she weeps, falls motionless to the floor, or goes and sleeps with total strangers on her wedding night. Because she's so, so, so sad, you see.

This is art?

I'll admit, Lars Von Trier IS an artist, but if this is what he's going to apply his skill to, then I want none of it. The movie begins with a pastiche of ultra-slow-motion images set to classical music. I didn't time this section, but it seemed to last nearly twenty minutes (I'm almost certainly wrong). I thought every image was gorgeous and stunning, and I immediately knew that I was going to hate the film. Why? Because it announced, at the start, that it was EXCLUSIVELY about the lavishness of the imagery. Even that I could stand if I didn't have to endure another two hours of a pretty and entitled girl crying for absolutely no reason whatsoever. C'mon, Lars! Make it about a short order cook or an oil rig worker or a fifty-year old divorcee with diabetes. Characters with complexity and powerful lives -- these are people I might be able to handle roiling in self-pity for 120 minutes. A disaffected girl who might just be too rich and coddled? Please.

I did some research, desperate to understand why such a dismal wreck would ever be conceived, let alone put to film, and I read that Lars wanted to show multiple facets of depression. In other words, he wanted to show the good and the bad, how depression might be useful or workable under certain circumstances. How could that be? Well, it turns out that it is useful to be skilled at depression when the world is going to end. End of Deep Important Message.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

Yes. The world ends in the film, and part of Lars' message (if the interview is to be believed) is that Dunst's character's familiarity with abiding ennui made her especially suited to enduring the destruction of mankind. This is about the most ridiculous point a film could make, since the utter destruction of mankind renders moot the way any humans deal with it. Who freaking cares if someone deals with Earth's obliteration with suicide, grace and aplomb, selfish weeping, or some kind of drug-fueled orgy? In the end, you're left with one thing: the utter obliteration of mankind. For crying out loud, is this some kind of deep, insightful message?

I'm sorry. I probably sound bitter. I guess I am. I only bought and watched this movie after the endless praise it received from critics and friends, and when I returned to said friends with less-than-glowing remarks, I was told that I lacked patience, cared more about commercialism, or was too easily bored.

Nah. I like my movies to be about things. And if they're going to travel the path of artistic flair, I'd still like that art -- beautiful or not -- to teach me something either a) new, b) interesting, or c) profound. MELANCHOLIA's message is absolutely NONE of those things, and I will gladly debate anyone who says otherwise. You can film sadness as gorgeously as you want, but if the sadness is prompted by nothing, propelled by nothing, and ends in nothing, then the end result is exactly the same: a big, fat, zero."
685,3.0,"Warner didn't took advantage of the DVD format by adding the special features(like the theatrical trailer) and a 5.1 soundtrack. I had to tune up the volume up to 20 decibels(I own a home theatre system). The picture quality looks better than the 97 release though. I didn't buy this new DVD because I borrowed it from a friend and Warner did not do a good job with this years release. I hope next years release is better like the size of a mammoth loaded with lots of goodies. We'll see.

Roy Batty is freaking hilarious in his last minutes of his life. :)"
686,2.0,"...the ball was dropped on this film. Someone in Hollywood believed Brendon Fraiser and Jet Li in the same film would miraculously make this a winner. That someone should lose his job.

Synopsis: Ancient Chinese warlord is reawakened (along with 10,000 Terra Cotta warriors) to conquer the world. And there are Yetis....

The first two movies in the series were fantastically entertaining. You had action, emotion, love, despair, and discoveries of a linked past that made the movies engrossing. They had excellent scripts, beautiful effects, and acting that made it look real. I watch them over and over. This dog...well, at least I watched until the end.

Whoever cast this movie screwed the pooch. Fraser, as Rick O'Connell is, of course, excellent. I love the gung ho balls ahead character. He IS the character. In fact, he is the franchise.

Rachael Weisz declined to return citing problems with the script. Boy did she make the right call. So Maria Bello is cast as Evy. Dear God In Heaven. what where they thinking! Where Weisz played Evuy with emotion, perfect timing, and a boatload of sex appeal, Bello is a block of freaking wood who phones in her part. She has NO fluidity, no sense of timing, and not a trace of sex appeal. In fact, a block of wood could have done a much better job.

In the 2nd film, The Mummy Returns, the son, Alex, has a very strong `proper' English accent and typical `Brit' attitude. In this movie, Alex (Luke Ford) has NO trace of accent or his English upbringing. He plays the role like a young John Wayne, as if he was raised in Arizona. It totally fails.

Jet Li as Emperor Han...well, I loved him in Lethal Weapon 4, Unleashed, and The One. He should have done the role of Emperor Han with the same soft-sneering attitude he had in LW4. But he wasn't directed that way in this film. He was concrete, and wooden. There was no sense of surprise upon awakening 2000 years later. No marveling at the changes in the world. No wonder at how the world had changed. Totally unrealistic.

Redeeming factors: Michelle Yeoh (very big star in China) as Zi Yaun, the witch who betrays Han knowing his merciless character, Isabella Leong as her immortal daughter, and Russell Wong as General Ming Guo (Han's right hand man who falls in love with Zi Yaun). John Hannah plays Evy's gold-digging brother seamlessly from the prior films.

And there are the Yetis. Ya gotta love the Computer Graphics. At first, the Yetis were fluff, but then you start to like them. They are the `untarnished good' surrounded by evil.

The special effects are admirable. The battle scenes at the end are exceptional. The warriors (and Han) turning to sand and clay are so cool, myself and my friends all gave it a big `WHOA!'.

Rent it, just to see it. Own it, ONLY if you need to complete the series.

Hope this helps you decide."
687,5.0,"I pretty much thought rape could not be funny no matter what and it's not really. In any way shape or form rape is one of those things that just lacks comical value. And then I watched ""Hand Banana"". I think the people that make it might get high or maybe they did a lot of acid growing up. I don't know how these guys come up with this stuff. The writing is freaking great. The characters are all great. It's a great fuhking show, period. One of the most original and inspired TV shows ever. Don't let anyone deny it. It isn't remotely intended for everybody. Aqua Teen Hinger Force IS art.

Agree that season 5 is particularly for the already converted serious fans, and not the best season to start with. So, if somehow you haven't already been a fan for years now and haven't experienced earlier episodes go back to seasons 1,2,3, & 4."
688,5.0,"I recommend turning off all the lights, locking your wife out of the house, and watching all of these back to back.  Then go outside and punch your neighbor.  freaking awesome."
689,4.0,"Hello. My name is Laurie. I'm 22 years-old. And I am...addicted to Gossip Girl. There. I said it.

I had read the Gossip Girl books back when they first came out. And I liked them. I never did end up finishing the series. So when I heard they were creating a TV show based on the books I was mildly interested. But I actually didn't end up watching it due to my own gripes with the CW network.

But I ended up catching the end of an episode posted on youtube (Victor Victrola) and was instantly intrigued. So I watched the previous episodes online. It moved a little slow at first, but it soon picked up. And by the time the next episode aired on TV, I was hooked!

Let me just say that this show is NOT anymore scandalous/provocative  than other TV shows! That's all hype that the CW lets build in order to create buzz around the show. So all these parental boards freaking out need to chill. You're kids have probably already seen worse- hate to break it to you.

Yeah the show can be silly and dramatized. That's half the fun! And its nice to escape my boring everyday life for an hour and get caught up in it! In my opinion, it blows the novels right out of the water!

Another thing I like about the show is the cast. They always seem to be down to earth and cool in real life, and I think they do a great job with the material they're given. Its VERY easy for some of the story lines to become cheesy and redundant (given its technically a TEEN drama), but they always seem to pull it off and make it seem believable.

My only con of the DVDs is that there is no cast commentary of an episode. I think that would have been a good feature to have! The bloopers, however, are pretty hilarious.

There's a reason there's so much buzz about the show with young and older audiences alike. And that is because it truly is an addicting show. And every week you find yourself more buried in it than the week before. Its a vicious cycle really...

I definitely recommend it. Season 2 starts September 1st on the CW and I've never been so happy to see summer end! I know its gonna be good.

You know you love it."
690,2.0,"I'm not going to bother reading positive reviews of this Swamp Thing series because those reviews could not make ths show watchable for me. I always loved the Swamp Thing comic, the original 70's magazine. The first Swampt Thing movie was OK, but this series was just awful. I actually have not seen anything quite this infantile before. I suppose if you are in grammar school then perhaps this sort of show might interest you. This series was just freaking bizzarre in my opinion. I give the show two stars for the great Swamp Thing costume and makes up. Sure, he's a little rubbery and jiggling in some places but ol' swampy looks like the real deal, and that look is very faithful to the comic book. This series, however, was simply unwatchable for this reviewer. I bought the set for perhaps $20 at Walmart. I watched four episodes. The show was just so awful to the point of retarding my senses. I give the show two stars for the special effects of the Swamp Thing.

Terrible show for people with functioning brain cells."
691,1.0,"Basically bad actress drives back and forth down a park road at night freaking out hysterically the whole time and all caught on a dash cam of a police vehicle. Dont expect to be scared. You will find yourself wanting something to happen but nothing really does other than a cop on a radio fighting the aliens in the town while the actress plays the stereo typical dumb blonde role, or yelling at the movie because the actress's acting is so horrible. They could have done so much more with this movie concept but I am guessing cheaped out on the budget. The worst part was that the credits are over 20 mins long, why? why ? i ask you, because they thought it would be artsy to play the spooky music while each credit gets its own slide. PLEASE..... So glad this was free. Id  say this is a movie you watch when there is nothing esle on and you really don't mind watching nothing at all or maybe you are on some sort of medication in a mental ward and everything in life scares you, this would be your movie."

693,3.0,"This film attempts to capture in very artful, often pretentious passes, the unexpected and blossoming romance between a heterosexual French married/family man and the nihilistic, philosophical neighbor that he and his wife invite to dinner while vacationing for the summer in Provence. The acting is uniformly superb and the cinematography is exquisite: I watched chiefly due to the setting in one of France's most extraordinary landscapes.

The problem is that the characters are very thinly drawn, not especially engaging, and the premise is ... well, not convincing at all when you consider what the plot demands of the actors and the outcome of the story itself. What we have is an attempt to look with great melodrama and angst at what is basically a French straight guy (the character 'Frederic') developing a slight man-crush on the neighboring gay guy (the character 'Hugo') after a night of heavy drinking and talking about the meaning of life 'til dawn at the vacation rental in Provence.

That's the problem: I didn't buy the notion that this sort of post-drunken man-crush would really evolve into something earth-shattering with the Hugo character. It seemed a stretch, given the way the script was written. The emotions tossed about in subsequent scenes have an arbitrary, random, and almost self-consciously ""artsy"" character that detract from exploring this theme more convincingly and, as a result, my feeling about the ending/denouement was essentially, ""You're all a bunch of stressed-out French people who've had way too much to drink and gotten way too much sun while on vacation, like most people. Is there *possibly* a chance you're all freaking out for no compelling reason? Chill out, lay off the booze, take an aspirin and have a nap before you all have to go back to Paris or Toulouse and rejoin the rat-race.""

Anyhow, that's the ultimate impression I had, without giving any spoilers away.

A subsidiary plot-line involving the Hugo character and his dying father was a much more interesting idea and ought to have been the center of the story, with the tepid little Frederic/Hugo thing being a minor side-plot. But overall this was an artful little French movie with fine acting, interesting camera work, and ambient scenes of Provence that almost make-up for the half-baked storyline. Almost."
694,5.0,I freaking love this show!
695,5.0,"I've been dying to see this movie since I first heard of it late last year.  Sure, we could talk all day about just how ""wrong"" this movie is, but why not sit back, toss those bunched-up PC panties aside for a freaking hour and a half, and enjoy the heck out of this hilarious zombie movie already enjoying a cult following.  And for what it's worth, name me one other movie that transforms the mentally challenged into heroes.  That's what I thought.  Anyway, Special Dead is just hilarious, not only milking numerous stereotypes for all they're worth, but kicking them once they're proverbially down.  The zombies are just downright disgusting, their grey skin peeling off in bunches, their mouths filled with meat, blood, dirt, and heaven knows what else, and their blood just waiting to shoot out in mini-geysers as soon as they're attacked.  I don't know what the chicken-eating zombie was actually eating, but it looked even nastier than the real thing.  Low-budget horror filmmakers could learn a lot from watching this movie.  Even the soundtrack, featuring the likes of Dark Reign and Eating Alice, is pretty kicking - although nothing tops Andy Allen's unique campfire song (there's even a sing-along version before the ending credits).

As the tagline says, ""Sometimes heroes ride the short bus,"" and in this case they ride it to Camp Special Dude owned and operated by Cameron ""Snuff"" Stone (Larrs Jackson, who was just hilarious, especially on the topic of zombie horses), who bought the camp years ago for a song - because, we soon learn, it was infested with zombies.  Snuff's second in command is his son Machiavelli ""Mack"" Stone (Jason Brubaker).  Mack only seems to care about making time with female counselors Cassie (Amy Wade) and Harley (Haneka Haynes), but he turns out to have real skills when it comes to dispatching zombies.  The ""special"" kids include Snuff's wheelchair-bound daughter Dale (Gia Franzia); Todd (Anthony Rutowicz), whose loud talking, hideous toboggan, and talent for making all kinds of things out of popsicle sticks do little to help him convince Dale to be his girlfriend; an uncommunicative mountain of flesh who could well be descended from Tor Johnson (David Reynolds); a shy ""helmet head"" (April Wade); and several others of less importance to the story.  Adding greatly to the fun is Eriq (Jah Shams), a young gangster bound for boot camp who was accidentally placed on the wrong bus.  All of the actors were darn near brilliant, if you ask me (especially Franzia and Rutowicz).

Don't write any of these characters off too soon, not even the most challenged among them.  While guys like Mack rely mostly on obvious weapons such as shotguns, sickles, numchuks - yes, numchuks - and good, old-fashioned bare fists, the campers tend to adopt more unconventional fighting methods.  Of course, not everyone can survive, so you get the additional treat of watching special campers taking on their now-zombified peers.  You may want to turn your head at one point, though, as Mack demonstrates a most disgusting, non-lethal zombie-controlling method.

Now, maybe you're thinking you won't see any sex or nudity in a film like this - well, think again.  You, along with some of the voyeuristic campers, will definitely see ""boobies"" at Camp Special Dude.  You'll also hear plenty of foul language (of course, if I were fighting for my life against zombies, I would be cursing up a blue streak, too).  For the most part, though, this is a genuinely original and creative film (a real rarity in the American-made horror genre).  Just remember that everything you see here is all in the name of gory fun.  Where else are you going to see a zombie with Tourette Syndrome?  Needless to say, some people will feel deeply offended and outraged by this film (and most of them will undoubtedly condemn it without ever seeing so much as a trailer), but Special Dead wears such sobriquets as ""the most offensive zombie movie ever made"" with pride.  I'll be enjoying this movie numerous times in the coming years."
696,5.0,"What a great later Lana double feature.

Great scene from PORTRAIT IN BLACK:
Lana Turner is required to drive a car, at night alone, as part of a murder plot but guess what? She can't drive!
So she tries anyway 'cuz she has to but has absolutely no concept of steering or braking or how to work the ""push-button"" automatic transmission.
She follows Anthony Quinn in the other car through the streets of San Francisco swerving and clueless as they barrel along. It starts to rain but she doesn't know from windshield wipers. Finally gets those going when the arms at a rail crossing come down right in front of her freaking her out and separating her from Anthony Quinn as the train goes by. It's a scream!

Great Madame X moment:
Lana Turner and Ricardo Montalban are dancing and Lana remarks how the she loves the mansion but worries about the plumbing. Ricardo makes a remark about the ""facade covering the corrosion"", referring to the house and the rich people at the upper crust party.

Both these films are a hoot. Enjoy them as such!"
697,5.0,"Oh this movie is just so sweet. Cute, funny, characters. Visual effects I loved freaking a lot. I think kids would enjoy watching it. It's one of my favorite movies of all time."
698,1.0,"Another direct to DVD sequel/prequel from Disney. Bland color palette and lack luster animation are the foundation of this latest installment to the little mermaid series.

The thing that stands out the most is the awful, awful musical score to a series where the original is known for having an amazing variety of songs.

Seriously, they have ""Jump in the Line (Shake Shake Senora)"" as one of the songs. Are you freaking kidding me? Not an original Disney creation, one of the crappiest swing songs I have ever heard. I seriously hate the **** out of that song and they play it like 2 or 3 times throughout the movie because it's practically the only song they have.

If you had fond memories of the Little Mermaid, you owe it to yourself to NEVER see this movie."
699,2.0,"Back in 08, when the movie came out on DVD, there was a huge buzz about it winning best screenplay and, so I decided I should check it out.

The movie is about a 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff. I'm not kidding. I'm serious. Throughout the movie I tried to pretend that name wasn't the most pretentious female protagonist name I've ever heard but I failed. She talks like a real smartass and acts all cocky to people. She's 16 and is in love with Paulie Bleeker (again, another pretentious ""indie"" name). One day she finds out that she got pregnant from a time when she and Paulie had sex. She considers having an abortion, but after being forced to face the fact that once you make a decision it stays with you forever, she decides to come out about her pregnancy to her parents and give it up for adoption. She finds one family in a classified ad who has an infertile mother and goes to get to know them. She takes a keen kinship to the husband, who loves indie music and cinema, including one situation where they watch the 70s cheese horror flick ""The Wizard of Gore"". Then a bunch of drama and depressing indie pretentiousness ensues and... I... just... don't... freaking... care. The end.

I didn't HATE this film. Some lines were funny and I liked some of the cast, including the guy who played Jameson from Spider Man, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman, who of course charms in each role. One particularly powerful scene was when Juno has an emotional breakdown in the van- Finally she acts instead of trying to be a teenager and spewing cocky words.

To say the characters are cardboard is an understatement- they're TISSUE PAPER THIN. Juno is not likable at all. Why should I sympathize for her? She's just a smartassed cocky borderlining-on-bitch who has absolutely no reason to be in the story other than the fact that she's the protagonist and she's pregnant. And her constant pop culture references were don't help either. Paulie I have no respect for- come on, getting a girl knocked up before she's even old enough to drive has no respectability in it, and the movie tries to make me care about him by making him all ""cute"" and ""awkward"" but come on. Also, this film in a way almost glamorizes teen pregnancy- Their parents are cool with her being pregnant AT 16 (I've known people in this situation and trust me, their parents were the exact opposite of that). There's much more but it would be too long to list. Oh and for the record, I don't think I've EVER heard anyone say ""Pork swords"".

I don't even think creepy looking assassins with stupid haircuts and silenced shotguns could have saved this film. It's not terrible but I honestly don't get why it's so praised."
700,1.0,"That's it, I've had it. I've seen so many of these anime shows where either they ran out of budget, tried to cram a complete series of manga's into half the episodes, or just really lazy ""wrap it up"" story telling. I just want to make a note to all the animators out there. If you can't make a complete well thought out anime DON'T EVEN BOTHER! It's a waste of my time.

If you can't tell Tokko happens to be one such Animie. ""The Complete Series""? ""COMPLETE!?!"" this is the laziest animation I've ever seen. For 7 episodes nothing really happens matter of fact I was plain out bored. Then finally the last 6 become interesting and it just ends abruptly in the middle of a climatic battle. Don't get me wrong, this is far from ""BERSERK"". Although I hated that ending we at least got fulfilling episodes. The ending really just a way to push you into the manga where the story continued.

However Tokko, jeez! What's the point of this series? It's too short, the first episodes are too long and drawn out,and when it gets to the point when it starts to become interesting it just ends. Normally this is the type of anime that needs 24 or 48(2 seasons)episodes to fully play the story out. At best this is forgettable and trust me it will be forgotten there's nothing about it that really stands out aside from the girl who doesn't wear a bra and the ending that ticked me off.  People watch anime for the entertainment value and especially the story. What's the point of watching something that just ends right in the middle?

Imagine watching Starwars and as soon as Luke meets Darth Vader for the final battle they cut to a shot of the Deathstar exploding and roll the credits. That's this freaking anime! Why even bother making this? There's no point! Nothing happens to hold your interest and I could careless if there's a manga available for this. The story wasn't good enough for anyone to consider wasting their time to find a manga and try to read it just to figure out if Tokko is decent or not.

1 Deathstar for this crap! I'm putting my foot down. Good concept terrible execution. This anime should never have been made. Completely pointless!"
701,4.0,"okay, i know why it's part two, but it's a whole nother movie. strong film, and i think it's up there with the first one. i thought it was going to bite big time because you know sequals usually do, but this one sure did not. from the opening scene, through the heartache, to the supernatural, all the way to the end. it opened with a bang, and goes out with a bang. really a very good show no doubt. here's how it goes, a man who has a near death experience, due to a tragedy, returns with a whole new outlook. and that's not all. he comes back with a gift, or a curse, depends on how you look at it. he is able to tell when someone is going to die. will he be a hero, and save the day or let destiny run it's course. aside from freaking out because of all this and trying to deal with it, he tries to do the right thing, or so he thinks. along he finds someone who he forms this bond with, but what cruel fate is. he never saw it coming. he didn't ask for this, but as the movie rolls on he realizes what it all means, what he must do, what he shouldn't have done. where there is the living, there is the dead, and where there is good there is always evil. it's a bit of a roller coaster ride, and will take you down that road of do you believe or do you not. sometimes it's better to leave fate alone. the actors were great, the ghosts were a very nice and creepy, and the whole deal was time well spent. it had it's BOO moments that i so love. abe, played by nathan fillion, is an excellent actor. great performance and nice emotion. as for the leading lady sherry, played by katee sackhoff, was pretty good. she was the other half of this film. these actors had great chemistry which helped the film as well. two thumbs up."
702,4.0,1980's insider trading freaking cool
703,2.0,"I went into this movie knowing its insane backstory -- how director Richard Kelly (the man behind ""Donnie Darko"") was given ""carte blanche"" during the production, how he plotted a multimedia franchise that included a website and graphic novel prequels, how the film was panned at the Cannes Film Festival, and how it eventually sank into obscurity, taking Kelly's directorial career with it.  I had heard how it was supposed to be a barbed political and social satire, an allegory of the Book of Revelations, and a bold love letter to Philip K. Dick.  And I also heard how many people, from Internet critics to the very actors who starred in this thing, couldn't even begin to tell you what it was about.  And yet all this information just whetted my curiosity -- I had to know for myself whether it was as bad and insane as they said.

I can't say that I enjoyed this film, nor will I watch it again.  And the critics were right -- it's pretty bad and confusing.  And yet it'll stay with me for a long time, and will probably garner a cult following among people who enjoy weird cinema.

""Southland Tales"" takes place after a nuclear attack on Texas (who perpetrated said attack is never explained).  In the wake of the attack, the government declares martial law and turns the United States into a totalitarian state, while a wealthy scientist (Wallace Shawn) sets out to make a fortune from an ocean-generated power source he calls Fluid Karma in the hopes of usurping the oil industry.  The government is struggling to maintain an iron grip on the country and on the Internet, while a group of rebels calling themselves the Neo-Marxists fight to overthrow said government.  In the meantime, Fluid Karma is somehow ripping holes in the fabric of time and space, a fact the scientist is trying to both exploit and cover up.  And while all THIS is going on, an amnesiac actor (Dwayne Johnson) with ties to a powerful senator is teaming up with a porn star (Sara Michelle Geller) to write a screenplay that he hopes will change the world... if it doesn't destroy itself first.  Add Justin Timberlake as a brooding, Bible-quoting military sniper, Sean William Scott as twin brothers tentatively allied with the Neo-Marxists, Christopher Lambert as a crazy arms dealer peddling his wares from an ice cream truck, and a slew of ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni peppering the cast, and you have insanity on your hands.

Yeah, it's hard to describe this movie, because there's just SO freaking much going on.  It's difficult to know who's working with who, something not helped by the fact that alliances keep changing and betrayals keep popping up.  The director seems to think that packing everything he can possibly think of into one film is the best way to go, but all that does is make the movie a tangled and convoluted mess.  (The fact that the movie is only the second half of the story doesn't help -- Kelly expects people to read the graphic-novel prequels before watching the film, though said graphic novels were out of print by the time the film hit theaters.)  And the movie is NOT shy about throwing all kinds of symbolism and political commentary at the screen, mostly bashing Republicans and the Bush administration, and you get the feeling that the whole movie is trying to say something but thinks it's being smart by relying on allegory and metaphor to do it.  Sometimes this can work... but here it just makes an already confusing movie nearly impenetrable.

I do give the actors in this movie credit for trying, though many of them look rather bewildered as they play, as if they're not quite sure what's going on themselves.  Dwayne Johnson and Sean William Scott look particularly confused throughout the film, though it's hard to tell how much of this is their characters and how much is them going ""what on Earth did I sign up for?""  Some actors, like Sara Michelle Geller, seem to be phoning in their performances, while others, like Kevin Smith, Wallace Shawn and most of the SNL players, decide to have fun with their roles and ham it up as much as possible.  The actors who nail their roles the best would have to be Justin Timberlake and John Lovitz (the latter playing a cold-blooded murderous cop).  Both bring a sinister-ness and unexpected level of depth to their roles, and are surprisingly good actors for being a boy-band star and a snarky comedian respectively.  I wouldn't mind seeing either of these two in more dramatic roles in the future.

I see three major flaws with this movie aside from the confusing, convoluted plot.  The first is that the film is unable to stand on its own -- yes, the graphic novel prequels and the websites might give more information, but I shouldn't have to read a comic book to ""get"" a movie.  For a comparison, the movie ""Pacific Rim"" has a lot of information not included in the movie that adds to the experience, including graphic-novel prequels, but these aren't required reading to understand what's going on onscreen.  They're extras that people can enjoy once they're done with the film.  When a movie's incomprehensible without extra material outside the film, it's a failure in my eyes.

The second flaw is the director's ""throw everything at the screen and see what sticks"" approach to filmmaking.  I haven't seen ""Donnie Darko,"" so I don't know if that's his usual style, but here I get the feeling that Kelly couldn't bear to cut any ideas out of his screenplay and so just jammed everything he could into a single film.  Political satire, social satire, dystopian sci-fi, Biblical allegory, pop-culture parodies, apocalyptic thriller... this film tries way too much for even its generous two-and-a-half-hour runtime, and as such no single aspect gets the attention it deserves.  The entire film feels like several films cut apart and haphazardly stuck together, and that makes for a frustrating viewing experience.

The last flaw is the egocentric smugness that practically drips from every second of this film.  Despite the incomprehensibility of this film, it's very clear that Kelly had something to say, something he considered important enough to rub into the viewer's face at every opportunity.  And yet he didn't want to come right out and say it, but cloak it in metaphor and symbolism so he could crow ""you all just don't GET my genius!"" when questioned about it.  Maybe I'm alone in feeling this way, but I couldn't help but sense the director's arrogance as I watched, a nagging feeling that the director felt that if I couldn't understand his message, I just wasn't smart enough to appreciate his work.

Still... for all the confusion, madness, and director's ego that stank up this film, I know I'm not going to forget it anytime soon.  There's a weird sort of fascination that accompanies this movie, the sense that I'll never watch anything quite like this again.  It's a bizarre mishmash of sci-fi, satire, Biblical allegory, and passion project that throws weird scene after weird scene at the screen, and while these weird scenes rarely work, they do stick in one's mind, for better (Justin Timberlake's out-of-nowhere but memorable ""All These Things I've Done"" music video smack in the middle of the action) or for worse (the car commercial... just don't ask...).

It's hard to know who to recommend this film to, because I think most people would find it difficult to enjoy.  I'd say if you're a fan of bad or weird cinema, and you don't mind watching a movie and having no idea what's going on, give it a shot.  If nothing else, enjoy it for the madness of what's playing out onscreen, and the absurdity of seeing actors in roles that are completely against type.  Myself, I probably won't watch it again, and I can't say I really enjoyed it, but I'm certainly going to be thinking about it for a long time.  So I guess, in that respect, Kelly succeeded in making a memorable film, even if it's memorable for the wrong reasons."
704,3.0,"On a scale of one to five, I only give ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" three stars...and that's being incredbly generous.

I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this film, and there are moments of the movie that are absolutely fantastic. The problem is that all those scenes start off great, and then fizzle out into nothing spectacular. This film also cuts and changes a lot of info from the book, and changes certain things from the novel that had no business being changed. I just don't understand it.

Without giving too much away, here are some of the things that irked me about this movie (if you haven't read the book, though, beware that there are spoilers ahead):

 - The first 20 minutes or so of the film are AWFUL. They are nothing like the opening chapters of the book, which is a huge disappointment. Dumbledore especially bothers me at the beginning of the movie. His dialogue is ridiculous, and the significance of his withered hand are glossed over in an offhand remark to Harry. (Also, that hand looks nothing like it should. In the movie, Dumbledore's hand looks like its owner has merely been outside gardening for a couple of hours. In the book, the hand is supposed to be a black, charred, disgusting mess. Why cut corners on the big screen?)

- Also in regards to the first few minutes of the book, I was disappointed that the Snape/Narcissa/Bellatrix scene was pushed back until later in the film, and was exceptionally brief. It could have been much better.

- Too much of the movie was devoted to silly romance. Don't get me wrong: The Ron/Hermione/Lavender triangle was a big part of Book Six, and the actress playing Lavender in the film was absolutely hysterical. However, too much time was devoted to teenage romance instead of other important plot elements that were completely cut out  of the film altogether.

- Speaking of silly romance, the Harry/Ginny relationship was really shafted in the movie. It started off well, but never really climaxed at all. At the end of the book, Harry and Ginny are officially an item, and there's a very poignant moment where Harry tells Ginny why they can't be together because he'll inadvertently put her in danger and because he needs to fulfill his destiny, etc. That scene was completely omitted from the movie, and in the film, you really don't know if Harry and Ginny are really together or not. It's ridiculous!

- Fenrir Greyback's character in the movie was a MASSIVE disappointment. He appeared in the film, but no one even really knew that he was a werewolf, because the whole scene where he attacks Bill Weasley was omitted from the film! Why include the character at all if they were going to cut that scene? It makes absolutely no sense!

- Too much time was devoted to Draco Malfoy practicing for his ""grand event."" Tom Felton did a great job portraying Draco in this film, but seriously, did the filmmakers really need to include four or five separate scenes of Draco practicing using the vanishing cabinet? I don't think so.

- For me, the last 25 minutes or so of the film were the biggest disappointment of all. The worst part about it is that certain aspects of these scenes were amazing: the visual setting when Dumbledore and Harry arrive at the mouth of the cave, the dialogue between Snape and Dumbledore at the tower, etc. Unfortunately, though, the scenes that started off great ended up sucking. For example, the ""evil souls"" living in the lake were total rip-offs of Gollum from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and didn't look anything like I imagined that they should. Also, I hated the death scene at the end, which was poorly done and happened way too quickly. The Snape/Harry confrontation at the end of the film also seemed incredibly lackluster. I really wanted Harry to scream at Snape and go nuts on him, but instead Daniel Radcliffe just kind of muttered, ""Coward,"" and that was it.

- The ending of the film was TERRIBLE! After the death, only about 30 people were gathered around the body, and no one was freaking out the way they do in the book. HELLO! One of the most important characters in the series is dead! Doesn't anyone care? All they do is hold their wands up in the air for a few seconds in some sort of pathetic salute. It's awful! It was so subdued. And where was the funeral?! In the book, people travel from all over the world to attend the service, and the coffin goes up in white flames, which would have been a great way to end the movie. Instead, the audience was left with a boring shot of the back of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads. It was awful!

I really expected more from this film. Again, I will concede that there were some decent moments, but I think the script and the overall direction were severely lacking. I really hope they don't screw up the final two films in the series. Warner Brothers Execs, if you are reading this, I hereby volunteer to adapt the screenplay for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" and to direct both movies for free just to make sure they are done right!"
705,5.0,"This movie is just down right terrible. It's boring and the plot doesn't make one bit of sense. It's just a long drug out piece of crap. ...BUT...Amber Tamblyn looks so freaking hot in this movie,and she is the only reason why I loved it. If you think Amber is as sexy,as I think she is,then you GOTTA see this movie! She'll blow you away!"
706,5.0,"Romance & Cigarettes (2005) James Gandolfini, Susan Sarandon, Kate Winslet, Steve Buscemi
Rated R.
Finally a romantic comedy musical for real He men! And it's about freaking time!
Offbeat and tweaked, and totally bent. Dripping with cigarette smoke, beer fumes and guy sweat.
And the lusty lure of women in red.
For manly men only. No girls allowed.
Prudes beware.
Plenty of classic songs punctuate the procedings throughout.
Buscemi is positively hilarious.
Somebody, anybody, please, oh please,  pinch me. And pinch me hard.
Bizarre choreography abounds, along with the twisted humor.
Very much a one of a kind Indie film. Oddball characters spring out of nowhere.
Kate Winslet is just as gloriously sexy as she could possibly be. I vote her the sexiest redhead alive. She is literally mouth watering in her bad girl role.
Through it all the movie does have its serious side, too, as a husband and his wife and their daughters all go through marital and family issues.
Probably the most unusual musical comedy/drama you will ever see. Ridiculously outrageous and outrageously ridiculous.
'Nuff said."
707,3.0,This movie starts out very interesting and exciting with full of actions then it got so freaking confusing as hell to end up being silly. Yeah right...
708,3.0,"This film follows a mentally handicapped young man who is living with his father and invalid mother.  The film sets up early on that James has a severe mental illness that renders him unable to care for himself.  His mother Nancy is confined to her bed, while father Donald has his hands full caring for both.  But when Donald is called away on business, James gets angry that he isn't left in charge.  He wants to prove to his parents that he is the man of the house - so he locks the hired nurse out of the house and begins to try and take care of his mother.  Things quickly spiral out of control as James stops taking his medicine and ""forces"" his care onto his distraught mother.

The setup for the film is quite nice.  Rumley creates a soft-spot for the audience in James and his father.  Early scenes show James freaking out and his father lovingly taking care of him.  Later, as James begins to put his mother's life in danger, we do not feel so much angry with James, but rather we feel sorry for him.  This film is less about the danger faced by Nancy, and more about the sadness of James' strong desire yet incapicity to care for his mom.

Unfortunately, the main story ""ends"" about midway through the film, and the final act begins to fall apart.  James' psychosis begins to go into overdrive, and he has one of the strangest hallucinations I've seen in film.  Later, his father goes similarly nuts, and it begins to become difficult to follow the storyline.  By the end, it was difficult to tell who had done what to whom, and how much of what we saw really took place, and when.  This muddled final act undoes all the good the first half had set up.

Performances are good across the board, with Leo Bill having the most difficult job of the three bringing James' psychosis to life.  The character he creates is nearly laughable in the early portions of the film (think an amalgamation of the characters Rick and Vyvyan from the UK TV series, THE YOUNG ONES).  As the film progresses, the odd mannerisms become equally frightening and heartbreaking.

If Rumley had stretched out the middle portion of the film a bit longer, and had a more comprehensible ending, I might have recommended the film - as it is, it is largely a disappointment.  I give it three stars for good acting and an interesting opening portion.

Take Note: while there is only a sparse amount of gore and no sex or language, the film has some disturbing thematic moments between the mother and son as he tries to care for her."
709,4.0,"""Old fashioned"" may be a relative term regarding horror movies, of whom I count myself a fan. But it gets harder and harder to find something I can really watch; unlike a lotta newbies to the genre, I really don't want to find the most bloody and realistic depiction of chainsaw massacres.

I like horror movies that surprise, that are clever, that are pure escapism. The worst and most horrific blood and gore isn't my idea of a horror movie. That's just stupid, or maybe I should say adolescent (which is why it's adolescent boys who constantly yammer for more and more.)

Hatchet is made for folks like me: people who remember when going to a horror movie was FUN, and not just an exercise in blood and gore.

Don't get me wrong, though. There's plenty of blood and gore in Hatchet, but it's the fake kind, and yeah, that's on purpose. The liner notes (so to speak) say this movie was created as a paen to 80s-type horror movies, and that is definitely true.

But Adam Green, the writer and director, wanted to make a movie that would be an updated version of 80s-style slashfests. He succeeded admirably.

The movie is just fun. One of the rules of these type of movies is that anyone who has sex is gonna GET it. And yeah, they do. There are two slutty chicks, one a Valley girl, and the other a faux NYU acting school graduate with pretensions of ""art"" who are making a ""Girls Gone Wild"" soft porn movie with a sleazy director. There is the boring older couple, constantly invoking the name of Jayzus; the requisite black guy with great expressions; a Chinese or Korean or Filipino guy (our token Asian) who also pretends to be a Cajun tour guide; and the hero, the resident geek.

The heroine is a plucky southern chick, combing the swamp for her white trash daddy and brother (parts filled respectively with 80s horror icon Robert Englund, otherwise known as Freddie from Nightmare on Elm Street and Joshua Leonard, the guy whose teeth turned up in a bag of rags and twigs in 'Blair Witch Project.')

Hatchet is cliche-ridden, and freaking funny and fun as hell. The extras with this DVD are fun, too (which is amazing, since it's so rare to get DVD extras that actually are as good as the movie!)

Totally recommended for the 80s horror flick fan!"
710,5.0,"I walked away from the first viewing of this film with just about everyone else's reaction, WTF? After getting over what I thought the film should be and accepting what it was, I found that I needed a second time around to have an unbiased oppinion of the film.
 I loved this movie, I have found that as much as liked the 07 installment, I have to go with this one as the great denoument that really pushes the violence to the level that Michael needs to be at, unbound and raw, a souless killing machine, a sympathetic monster.
 Granted this movie is chuck full of continuity errors and annoying acting, but I for one came to see Michael do his thing and I got just that. The death scenes were the best I've seen so far, that first nurse's death made me feel both perspectives of a murder from the killer and victim perspective that it set my teeth on edge. Also let's not forget the great look and feel of a Halloween based Haddonfield that has not been topped in any Halloween film before, I'm still searching as to where I can find the giant evil pumpkin king decoration at the party scene.
 I think everyone's major problem with this as was mine at first is that this film is not what you expected from the series, like the original Halloween 3 it is a different film that really sets the essence of Halloween in full.
 One more thing, why the beard? Why the hair in the face in the last film? BECAUSE THESE ARE MASKS TOO! The shot of Tyler Mane's face when the little kid bumps into him on the street is freaking scary, he looks like a stone cold crazy very effectively.
 The bottom line is, see this film. If you didn't like it because it wasn't what you expected, see it again, you might be suprised at what you think about it after leaving your preconceptions at the door.
Hoping for a director's cut on Blu Ray and excited to see H3."
711,1.0,"Another Seagal film and another waste of my time! If the movie was 20 minutes long it would be one of the greatest action films of all time. I can't stand these low budget films, I hate how instead of giving us what we want we're subjected to seeing Seagal walk around talking and smiling for 90 minutes. If the man could act, if the script was well written, then it would be a different story. When we do get action, it's mostly body doubles. The only good thing about this film is the final shootout at the graveyard. It was done like a pro but they obviously put their entire budget into that and relied on the script and Steven for the rest. The movie is a failure and should be avoided.

I also saw Van Damme's new film The Shepherd which comes out the same day and it was freaking spectacular. It was filled with martial arts, high octane car chases and tons of action. Why can't Seagal give us that?"
712,4.0,"With Michaeal Gross, Chris Atkins and Greg Evigan.
This could be a sequel to Journey To The Center Of The Earth or a prequel ?
Maybe that's not fair,This is supposed to be a bigger film and has more success already on Sci-Fi Channel.
Great cast, Script has some true moments and plenty of special effects.
Michael Gross( from TREMORS) has some sparks with a character that is allowed to breathe life into a mad scientist role.
Greg Evigan(BJ & THE BEAR) I believe was filming two movies a t once, And is noticeably In/out Burger-ish.
Christopher Atkins(DALLAS) has fun scenes and the major love interest for one of few females along for the trek.
We are disheartened on two points-
 Griff Furst ,WHY WAS your name removed as director ?
The second, Saw these great behind the scenes on raptor and execution lacked, But T-REX was' freaking beacon of hope for kewl  visuals'.
Producers give more work to Stephen Blackehart , Geoff Meed  and Eric Spudic ,'Wow' gentlemen !"

wwe chamipionship john cena vs hhh vs randy orton this is a pretty good match and a lot better than what i was thinking it was going to be but still felt like it could have been better but it was a little over ok and at least it wasn't main event 4/5

big show vs floyd mayweather it was so much better than i thought it would be and i find it very good fun to watch and i never got bored with the match but again a least mayweather didn't beat show cleanly like i thought he was going to be so that makes me feel better that paul didn't come back just to get buried right when he came back 4/5

world heavyweight championship undertaker vs edge o my freaking goodness this is one of the best wrestling matches i have ever seen they put on one heck of a show counter after counter and false finsh after false finish it is just one of the best matches i have ever seen and when i saw it for the first time to me it istantly became in my top ten best matches 5/5 and its a show stealer

76% which is a pretty good grade

the other match is a bad battle royal but the hof was really good this year so watch it also the best ppv for tna and wwe since bound for glory 2007 which is one of the best shows i have ever seen so if you don't have this or that buy them both great great shows"
714,1.0,"I just finished watching ""Inside"". I found it by googling French horror movies and someone recommended ""Inside"". I looked it up and it seemed to have gotten rave reviews so I decided to buy it. It's a story about a pregnant woman who gets into a car accident, she loses her husband but her baby is fine. She is depressed and generally mean. The night before she gives birth a strange woman appears at her house, and things get blood, gory, and violent.

That's basically the entire movie. It is pretty much a mindless gore fest with some artsy fartsy lightening and scenes at times.

Pacing: The pacing was very slow at the beginning, the opening credits were too long and nearly put me and everyone else to sleep. The beginning was also slow and sleep inducing. Only when the stranger appears that the movie begins to pick up and delivers on its promise of ""scary""

Scare rating: Not very high overall. 1 out of 10 and I'll give it a 3 or 4 for when the stranger first appears. The scenes were well done. However, after the stranger is in the house and things get gory the less scary the movie became.

Plot: The movie over all was kind of stupid, the characters did stupid things that just simply made the plot carry on but made no logical sense at all. The stranger drives a pair of scissors through the pregnant woman's hand and she doesn't scream at all despite the police being right downstairs?  One police officer doesn't bother to cuff her right away, he just stands there then lets her grab a weapon? The pregnant woman doesn't cooperates with the police that do arrive. i get it, she is traumatized but seriously she doesn't alert the police to her presence et al even when they are right at the door to get her. A police officer brings a perp into the house with him? wth. But nothing tops the random police offer turned ZOMBIE for no freaking reason!

The police never call for back up, and are pretty much funneled in to be killed.  They leave the pregnant woman alone to find a breaker box while the killer is nowhere to be seen yet all they have to do is escort the victim outside and put her in the police car! Oh yeah and call for back up! suddenly the victim goes to the front door and cannot not unlock it to leave, even though she is INSIDE the house and can just turn the freaking lock and go.

Everyone eventually started laughing at the silly over the topness of this movie and just wanted the pregnant woman to die already so this movie can end.

The only thing that kept us watching was to find out if the movie had any saving grace, it didn't. It's a mindless gore fest, parody like, and nothing more. if this movie was made in the U.S. It would get nothing but one and two star ratings and dismissed as a bad American horror movie with no plot."
715,3.0,"There were two movies that came out in 2008 which probably rank among the worst in history, this one and Punisher: War Zone.

This movie sucks.  You can pretty much ignore what every character says and just insert something you know from Lord of the Rings or Willow.  You'll be close enough that it won't matter.  Better yet, just watch it in German.  It is after all the director's native language.  As for the plot, again, just make up your own details from what you've read and seen.  You can see the formula revealed without much effort.

""But you gave it three stars, dip****!!""

Yes, and here's why.  This film is a monument to bad filmmaking, a milestone that may never be surpassed.  It's a clash of opposites though because it is an incredibly expensive, slick production.  I would call it one of the most well-made bad movies ever.  So much effort and expense went into casting, action sequences, choreography and special effects that it should have been good, but Boll made it awful, so awful that I had to keep watching to see how much more awful it was going to get.  Here's a quick breakdown:

Farmer's name is Farmer and he's hero Jason Statham (possibly the only good casting choice).

Farmer's friend is Ron Perlman who for some reason isn't cast as creepy bad guy.

Creepy bad guy is Ray Liotta, which doesn't make sense because he's got in Irish blood in him so he could never be a made man (It's Ray freaking Liotta in a freaking Fantasy movie, what can you say to that!?).

The role of Gandalf will be played by Gimli, son of Gloin.

The role of Arwen/Eowyn will be played by Leelee Sobieski, who is young, pretty and maybe talented, but honestly, the fact that she is in it at all should tell you it's a bad movie.  She may consider finding a new agent.

It's a fantasy movie and Burt Reynolds is in it.  Why?  Because they could, I guess.

Burt Reynolds's toadie is Matthew Lillard, which should be another tip-off that it will be a bad movie.

So the hero decides to be a hero, fights some nondescript bad guys, rallies more people to fight nondescript bad guys, then it all comes to a head and they all fight the one descript (well, if nondescript is a word...) Ray Liotta (Ray Liotta?? Seriously??).  Lots of fighting and dialogue reminiscent of Star Wars prequel trilogy (low blow, I realize that) ensue along the way.

In two words, it's heroicly bad.  If you are a real movie buff, you HAVE to see this movie just to see how bad it is.  It's as if you're watching bad film history unfold before your eyes.  That is the only reason I give it a positive rating, because for better or for worse (mostly worse), it's worth seeing."
716,5.0,"This is probably a 4-star movie at best, but I'm giving it extra because:

1) It's not gratuitous with violence or language, and has no sex
2) It doesn't waste my freaking time with superfluous footage, long intros, extensive backgrounds, dull dialogue or any other filler crap.
It gets to the point and gets it done.
3) As others mention, I love the ""Rashomon"" or ""Run Lola Run"" format
of different perspectives on the same event.

Sure, it's over the top in parts, extremely coincidental in others, or just plain unbeleivable at times, but it's a nice little family type thriller that pushes the pedal down and gives a good ride.  Hell, that's something that's hard to find at Blockbuster these days.  Props!"
717,4.0,"This Brittish horror comedy starts out as a botched kidnapping for the first half of the film. It starts with two brothers(David and Peter) kidnapping the daughter of a gangster and taking her to a cabin out in the woods. They ask for a ransom of 100 thousand which is brought to them by the girl's stepbrother(Andrew) who is also in on the kidnapping. However he failed to check the case the money was supposed to be in and realizes it was empty after reaching the cabin. Meanwhile the gangster was aware of the stepbrothers involvement and sends two asian hitmen after them. The first half of the film plays out more like a black comedy and a thriller. Peter is shown to be incompetent in his task and ends up getting his nose broken by the girl using a headbutt on him while being tied up. Peter also has a severe case of moth phobia shown through several humorous scenes of him freaking out in the presence of a moth. The stepbrother Andrew is shown to be a complete moron by not checking the suitcase for money and also buying himself a facemask that doesn't even cover his face.
David drives over to a nearby town to call the gangster and demand his money. While he is in town the first signs of a horror film start to show. The townsfolk act strangely around him and warn him about what happens to strangers in the area. David returns to the cabin to find only Andrew fainted with Peter and the girl gone. At this point it would look like the two hitmen were responsible but are later shown to be only a red-herring as a body with a slit-throat of one of them is found. David and Andrew and Peter and the girl each encounter the real killer of the film, a deformed backwoods farmer that stalks them for the rest of the film. The plot twist in the middle of this film can be compared to ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" with a hostage thriller quickly turning to a vampire film except in this it quickly turns into a hillibilly slasher type film.
While this no ""Dead Alive"" as far as blood and gore there are some good bloody kills in the movie and the gore level rises a lot in the second half. A difference this film has from other backwoods slasher films like ""Wrong Turn"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is that the killer didn't become the way he is from inbreeding or radiation like in the other films. The Farmer was deformed in a machine accident that ended up disfiguring his face. The idea of a a backwoodsman going on a killing spree isn't exactly otiginal but this movie is different enough from the usual to not make it tired or cliche. Overall this is a fun and entertaining horror comedy film that is recommended for fans of horror comedies, British horror, or horror films in general."
718,5.0,"I highly recommend this production. With some wonderful sets this beloved opera , to me my favorite Mozart- has been placed in a WWI ""reality"". Here was an opportunity to have opposing armies come together for a little Christmas party thanks to the transforming effect of the magic fltue and chime box of Papageno. You ought to be somewhat bedazzled by the technical difficulty of this set design. I have no problem with the concept at all..rather nice, , in fact, I'd like to see even more imaginative productions like this one...the Swedish version by reknown film maker Ingrid Bergman is still my favorite so far.

I have one complaint, which doesn't take away from this production, except for those of us with white whiskers. It is sung
in English. Boooooo.

Beverly Sills tried this with ""La Fille du Regiment""..and that too, I hardly caught a single word that was intelligeable. It just does NOT work! To understand this, you sort of have to be that age where the eyesight is not so great, nor the hearing - all of us lose the upper range. Once you arrive at this sorry state, you will obsrve that NO ONE speaks the King's English well!..especially young people who are talking faster and faster and faster with each passing year. Today, any youth could ba an auctioneer...it wouldn't matter if youdidn't understand them...all except for ""going, going...sold""

Those of us who sing, know that when we sing in Italian, the best language for singing, period...each and every vowel has a strictly precise shaping of the mouth lips and tongue. There is some variance re.  intonation,,resonating farther back in the
mouth and throat, and sometimes forward...all achieved by precision movements and shaping - round for ""O""...wide open for ""A"", almost a grimace for ""i"" or ""ee""; lips protruding for ""U"" ""oo"".Italian voice coaches have been known to train young singers for months , working on just the vowels..and then gradually teaching to just touch on a consonant, but touch on it with great clarity! You will know a ""T"" from a ""D"", or a ""P"" froma ""B"". You can observe this now ~ that you know...watch great Italian singers, and Spanish ones, of course, Domingo,Jose BRos, Carreras, Caballe, Maria Bayo, etc.,  and you will clearly see the mouth shapes I describe above.

Then observe in the ""features"" track of this DVD, the interview with the producer and actor kenneth Branagh..watch carefully as he speaks through a narrow slit of lips..bringing the lips together only if he absolutely HAS to...this is how all young people today speak...doing virtually all the pronouncing in the very back of the throat, with barely moving lips.

In a word?...""Gargling words""...gargling! The lips are there for a reason, people!

And singing coloratura embellishments and roccoco curly cues, a dozen notes or more on one freaking syllable...and do you think that is understood? it is impossible to understand!..So..my friends with white whiskers...you are forewarned...you absolutely must know the story very well to know what the hell is going on with this production."

The music is moving, the story line is cute, I am *spolier alert* glad August found his family... I kind of wish I was able to see them living that happily ever after, but I can see it in my head, lol.

I am in love with the music and am now looking for the soundtrack..."
720,5.0,"Oh my gosh this is a freaking good movie that truly builds on itself! I could not have predicted many a things in it. Watch it and sit back and reflect on it. You don't see movies like this everyday. If your used to traditional movies you might not enjoy it but in my opinion, this movie is how most movies should be. Original and unique."
721,3.0,"Let me start out by saying I am a huge fan of both Cormac McCarthy and the Coens, however as a would-be crime writer myself I have to admit I became pretty annoyed with NCFOM the last time I watched it. There are several bizarre plot developments that make no sense at all in the real world. These serve to really sap the believability of the story and take away from the overall experience.

Primary among these is the decision by Brolin's character (Lewellyn Moss) to return to the scene of the drug deal shoot-out. This really requires a huge leap of faith from the viewers. Seriously, what person in their right minds, having walked away CLEAN with $2m, would return to the scene to give someone a drink of water? This is just pure freaking craziness. That was a HUGE problem for me. If the guy had dropped something that could ID him and had to return to retrieve it, I would have been much happier. That would make sense! But to just go back for no reason other than to give a really bad guy and a total stranger, who by then is most likely DEAD, a drink of water is a huge mountain to climb. Moss strikes me as a supremely practical kind of guy. Everything he does up to that point is thought through carefully with one aim - to preserve his own hide. So why in hell would he get out of bed in the middle of the night and do something that dumb? In the REAL world he would have been on his way to Vegas with that $2m to party it up with his ill-gotten gains and there is NO WAY he would have gone back there.

Secondly, the scene when Tom Bell and the deputy visit the trailer park and discover that Chigurh was just there before them. The Deputy exclaims, 'Oh Sheriff, let me call it in!"" and Bell responds, ""what are you going to tell them? That we are looking for someone who has recently drunk milk?"" And then proceeds to drink from the glass. I just about heaved something through the television at that point. No law enforcement officer in the WORLD would pass up the chance to run that glass for prints and DNA. How does he know at that point that they don't have that guy in the system? Any idiot who watches the Crime channel etc knows that DNA is the number one most effective method for catching bad guys. Even a miniscule amount is enough. When you have someone's mouth just having slobbered all over a glass, that's like a freaking WEALTH of DNA evidence. Even if the guy isn't in the system (quite likely since he's a pro and probably an import) at the very LEAST it might help somewhere down the line in the course of the investigation. So, major faux pas number two!

There are several other little details that are glossed over. Like how does Chigurh access his handler's (Stephen Root) office, when there is no access to that floor from the street elevator, as pointed out by Woody Harrelson's character in an earlier scene? How is Moss too dumb to think of transferring the money to another case until its almost too late? And last but not least, it simply ain't possible to silence a shotgun so that you can repeatedly fire silenced rounds through it. Yes, we are used to seeing Hollywood take huge liberties with firearm reality, but seriously, if you have any concept of how a shotgun works, you'd know that's not possible. You can build a temporary silencer for one, but after one shot you'd have to replace it, because it would be blown to s*** by the pellets and or slug.

Other than that, this movie is near perfect, but the above bits of BS are major issues for me, and they have definitely coloured my enjoyment of this film."
722,2.0,"couldnt get past the girls freaking out in typical girl fashion, pisses me off. the commercials really captured the best parts TT.TT"
723,2.0,"Emile Hirsch, what happened to you?  You're playing a douchy wannabe software entrepreneur whose best lines involve flirting with a flight attendant over airplane-cell phone propaganda.  We're only a few minutes into this movie and I already finding myself disliking your protagonist.  I've seen you quiet and soulful in Into the Wild (2007), humorously innocent in the amazing The Girl Next Door (2004), credibly authoritative in Alpha Dog (2006)...and now this?  Did you lose a bet or just piss off one too many directors with vegan, gluten-free, organic catering demands?  Simply accepting this role and this script was a failure before the cameras even started rolling.  We'll call this strike one.

Anyway, this software designer and his partner are on a business trip to Moscow to market a social networking app for navigating the club circuit in any major city in the world.  [Why did they need to go to Moscow for this?  Because it was cheaper to film the movie there.]  Hirsch plays the more laid back, carefree partner who is always telling his business-oriented friend to relax.  Not even ten minutes into this flick they are double-crossed by a third party and ousted out of their own deal.  This really deviates from the standard formula.  The Hostel series, The Chernobyl Diaries, Wrong Turn, Wolf Creek and The Cabin in the Woods rely more simply on a group of friends going on a vacation.  It's simple but it works.  You never find yourself saying ""what's the point in them being in Moscow for this business deal"" and the movie's credibility is maintained until the real fun starts when the players begin to drop one by one to whatever the random malevolent force the writers dreamed up.  That's strike two.

So our boys go out clubbing to drink away their failed business venture and meet up with two cuties.  They seem to get along when suddenly there's a world-scale power outage and countless energy-based life forms fall from the sky like snow-flaky embers aglow with Tinkerbell's fairy dust.  They start incinerating people like vampires to Blade's silver katana, people start running and screaming, and we're only fifteen minutes into the movie.  Well, at least we didn't have to suffer through the business deal plot any more.

As people scream and turn into aerosol compost our heroes, now numbering five with the addition of the shark who screwed them over on their app idea,  hide in a restaurant store room. A week after the invisible, incinerating invasion began, they emerge to go to the US Embassy...because they wouldn't have been charred, right?  Oh, and the slick douchebag has turned into an annoying high strung coward.  Those characters are so annoying and they never get killed off as fast as you'd like.

The streets of Moscow have turned into an I Am Legend, soulless dust bowl of abandoned cars and ghostly edifices.  Hirsch leads the way as they remain ever vigilant.  Because these energy-based aliens activate electronic devices (i.e., lights) when they are present, our heroes learn to travel when it's safest: night.

At one point Hirsch avoids detection by standing perfectly still as the creature just strolled by unaware on the other side of a window.  Considering that these things see lifeforms like glowing fireballs of infrared, making them extremely obvious, I think that moment of idiocy makes for strike three.  They can't see through glass or metal cages?  Whatever!  Now I have to watch these idiots walking around like glass shield-bearing knights.  Just stupid!
Along the way their group grows by two, one of which is an annoying Russian girl with such memorable lines as ""It's okay, I'm tough"" and ""I am not a kid!""  Barf!  I hope she dies next.  But luckily the other addition, a wacked out electrician, invented a Ghostbusters microwave gun to combat our electric invaders.

I guess the effects were tolerable.  But how many times can you entertain me with people getting jerked into the air for a second and then getting turned to spiraling cinders by some invisible dust devil alien?  They shatter glass and detonate doors--boring.  After they disintegrated the first few people and a dog the kills got boring.  Our heroes start freaking out every time a breeze kicks up some debris and then the ""dumb"" really hits the fan.  They meet dumber tough-talking characters who fight the aliens in dumb ways wearing dumb outfits amid ridiculously dumb scenarios and give dumb speeches about preserving every human life they can.  Just truckloads and truckloads of dumb!  Oh, and eventually you get to see these aliens and, you guessed it, they look dumb!  The worst effects in the movie were dedicated to showing us what the aliens truly look like without their invisibility shield--they look like some weird floating head monster from Doom.  It's most upsettingly dumb when Hirsch kills an alien by throwing a charred piece of another dead alien at it.  One throw?  Really?  Climax-fail!  Sorry, we're out of strikes.

In the end I wished everyone died.  The quality of this movie actually decreased as the running time wore on and, accordingly, I turned on the characters more and more with every passing scene.  I won't say skip this movie.  But if you choose to watch it, watch and mock it with friends."
724,1.0,"Intelligent film viewers beware:

Apparently, Ben Mezrich's fantastic, non-fictional account of beating the house -- for real -- in the mid-nineties was not good enough for the makers of this film.

For some incomprehensible reason, they took a fascinating real-life story, glammed it up, time-shifted it to the present day, packed it full of tired cliches and overused plot devices, and baked up what we have here -- a totally unbelievable, totally silly exercise in film frustration.

Even good actors cannot save a terrible script.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?  This could have been so smart, so good, just like the freaking book...

And by the way, the classroom exercise early in the film about a gameshow host and opening the doors makes absolutely no sense to me or my wife.  Knowing what's behind the third door does not help you decide which of the two remaining doors is preferred.  After door three is opened, the original choice of door number one becomes no more or less likely to win than door number two.

GET THE BOOK, it's great and might make you smarter.  This movie will just make you dumber."

There is a difference, believe me. Anyway, this movie provided me with a fair amount of everything I wanted at the moment. There is a background story that is introduced in beginning and provides adequate reasoning for where they ended up. I found myself showing sympathy for these main characters in the film and that was unusual as well as nice for me. Usually in Saws and Hostels, you do not care about who dies, but with this I felt they did a great character development. There are plenty of high tension scenes that provide you with usually a bloody ending;) There is a particularly squirmish scene where two of the guys are crawling through a hole in the movie that was more bothersome than watching the descent. AHH!! It made me wanna stretch out my arms and roll around to be thankful I was not caught in a freaking hole. The ending (climax) of the film was enjoyable as well and this is important because a movie can make or break it from an ending.

726,3.0,"The film starts off where Futurama: Bender's Big Score left off, the universe has a giant rip and people are freaking out. The Professor (Billy West), Hermes (Phil LaMarr), Leela (Katey Sagal), Bender (John DiMaggio), Amy (Lauren Tom) and Zoigberg (Billy West) are trying to figure out what to do about the space anomaly. During the meeting, Fry (Billy West) introduces the Planet Express crew to Colleen (Brittany Murphy), his new girlfriend.

Amy and Kip announce they are holding a Fonfon Ru ceremony (joining of families ceremony). The Planet Express crew join the ceremony and ""The Grand Priestess"" performs the ceremony in Kip's home world in the swamp. She also has five other jobs, also grand and she lives there. Colleen catches the bouquet that Kip throws, which makes Fry and Colleen believe it is meant to be with one another.

Later, Professor Farnsworth and Professor Wernstrom (David Herman) are unable to agree on who is going to lead the expedition into space at the University and have the Planet Express crew battle it out in a game of ""Deathball"" against grad students eager for a letter of recommendation. After the game of Deathball, Fry finds out that Colleen has a boyfriend on the opposing team as well as three other boyfriends. Fry decides not to go on the expedition to investigate the space anomaly and to move in with Colleen. Fry unable to deal with not being treated equal in a five-way relationship decides to immediately break up with Colleen. This leads to a big theme of the film with Yivo (David Cross) - a lonely planet with a billion tentacles and one eye.

Bender goes to the space anomaly with the rest of the Planet Express crew to investigate the space anomaly, but due to the fact that he is not human and the electro-magnetic field factor, he blasts the crew back to earth.  Fry frustrated with his love life decides he needs to get far away and hides in the bottom of Zapp Brannigan's ship. Fry later escaping from the lint compartment takes his spacesuit up to the anomaly and says goodbye to everything he knew and cared about and goes through the anomaly where he meets Yivo. Fry desperate for love and Yivo wanting to be cared for, come together.

The tentacles begin to break through the space anomaly and eventually reach earth. Fry as Yivo's host speaks to New New York and tells everyone that he loves the tentacle and they need to love it too. Eventually, Fry becomes the pope, has the rest of the world invaded and everyone with the exception of Leela are invaded by the tentacle. The rest of the film explores on Yivo's need for love and wanting to be in a serious relationship with everyone.

I found this film less exciting than Futurama: Bender's Big Score for several reasons, the film has three different ""feels"" to it: 1/3 feels like a film, 1/3 feels like the TV series, 1/3 feels like and episode of ""Tales of Interest"". I felt the section with Bender and the League of Robots was just used as filler to make the film longer and to have a purpose near the end of the film. There is a lot of American humour throughout the film, but none of it was good and are all one-liners. The only decent humour in the film was more European humour and by that I mean, fans of the series that will see things from the original series and laugh at the guest appearances by certain characters that appear in the film. Some of the other humour comes from Bender, knowing his personality and how he reacts in certain situations. Whilst Futurama: The Beast with A Billion Backs was not a horrid film, it was very average and to a good degree, the ending was almost predictable as well as partly using an event that happened in the TV series.
3/5

Picture:
The film is presented in the 1.78:1 (16:9) format. The picture was crystal clear throughout the film. There were only one or two times when some of the cells seemed a bit blurry, but it is nothing that is noticeable or would deter you from watching the film
4.5/5

Sound:
The film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Unlike Futurama: Bender's Big Score, this film actually takes advantage of all five speakers. Whilst I would have appreciated a few more sounds coming from the rear left and rear right speakers, as it would have given a more cinematic feel, I found that during action sequences the music really made use of all five speakers. The voice actors voices were always clearly audible in the centre speaker during the talking scenes, which for some films can sometimes be problematic.
4.5/5

Special Features:

The DVD includes: Commentary from the producers and cast, Futurama: The Lost Adventure (A Full-Length feature adventure produced for the video game), Storyboard Animatic, Deleted Scenes, David Cross Featurette, Blooperama, 3D Models with Animator Discussion, A Brief History of Deathball and Bender's Game Trailer.

Final Thoughts:

Futurama: The Beast with A Billion Backs was entertaining enough. However, I can honestly see this as three episodes of Futurama if the script was changed slightly. Fry and Colleen's relationship could have been an episode, Bender and the League of Robots its own episode and lastly Yivo and Earth could have been another single episode. There are many video game jokes in this film which are funny if you are a gamer and it was in Futurama taste. Overall, I would say if you are a Futurama fan you will want to see this  because of the guest appearances from characters from the show, but if you are a casual Futurama watcher I would just say rent it. Last thing I will say is, I watched the trailer for ""Futurama: Bender's Game"" and it looks like rubbish. It looks like a hour and a half version of ""Tales of Interest"" that is Dungeon's and Dragons themed. Yet, you never know it could be good, but I will post a review of that when it is released."
727,4.0,"I used to watch this show when it came out on TV in the late 90s and I loved it. Well, I was also a kid back then and easily impressed I guess. I mean wow was I enamored by Tony Crane who captured Remy McSwain's arrogant and sexy swagger so deliciously.  I also loved the sexual tension between him and Ann Osbourne and the steamy, sexy New Orleans scene and shots of the French Quarter and surrounding neighborhoods. The movie just had a certain charm to it.

Anyway, now, looking at the show I must say it is pretty bad. I love the music, the setting and the sexy vibe of it all, but story and acting wise it leaves much to be desired. It is just not very sophisticated. Remy McSwain (Tony Crane) is your typical film-noir detective. His character is pretty one dimensional and he acts more like he was a private eye than a cop. He is a caricature of your typical loner detective who has a problem with authority really and who roams the steamy city with driving a metallic blue Corvette with the top down while wearing white linen suits with yellow silk shirts and a gold ring. He really doesnt have much of a personality beyond that. I seriously doubt any cop could walk around and behave like that - not even in NO; then again, this is one of the charming things about the show - although it would have been nice to have a multidimensional character.

Ann Osbourne (Susan Walters) who's supposed to be the assistant DA is not very believable in that role, mainly because she spends most of her time chasing people around while playing detective with Remy and throwing in the occasional legal jargon to create tension between her and Remy.

The series is filled with clichees like that. For example, the chief of police walks around with a cigar in his mouth all day making snide remarks (you wonder how he became chief, he never seems to do any work).  The cranky female assistant is a bit quirky and is always ready to deliver some smart remark to antagonize the lead and of course there is  the lead's side-kick and buddy who is willing to break the rules on his behalf because he aint a cop like Remy.

So yes the story lines are unbelievable and the characters full formula, but I go in there understanding and accepting this as a premise and enjoy it.

I also don't care it supposedly wasn't a 100% accurate depiction of New Orleans or if the Cajun accent wasn't copied meticulously. This isn't supposed to be a freaking documentary but a lightweight cop show placed in New Orleans. If you want something more authentic, with the same story lines evolving around either sexual abuse, rape or passionate murders because of sexual abuse and rape, go watch Law Order or CSI. This show is mid/late 90s, kitch; it is goofy and colorful with a great soundtrack. Has sort of an innocence and simplicity to it that you cannot find in any of the TV shows of today that mostly seem to be about some kind of government or alien conspiracy with a political undertone. This show is easy entertainment and  Tony Crane is just dope."
728,5.0,"Sam Tyler is still stuck in 1973, unsure if he has somehow really travelled backwards in time or if he is merely stuck in a coma in 2006 and is fantasising everything that is happening to him. However, now he has been there for a few weeks he is getting more used to life in the 1970s and is starting to downplay the unusual auditory and visual hallucinations he continues to suffer from. But, just as things seem to be settling down, questions about Sam's previous 1970s life in 'Hyde' before relocating to Manchester arise, and set in chain a sequence of events which could lead Sam home...wherever that is.

Life on Mars' second season was the last, due to a combination of the producers not wishing to over-exploit the concept and lead actor John Simm's well-known reluctance to be typecast in a long-running television series. It was a bold decision for a series that had become a big hit on British television and done the seemingly impossible by getting audiences fired up over a cop show.

The second season offers up pretty much more of the same as the first season: Sam and Gene butt heads over their different approaches to policing, but they have, grudgingly, accepted that each has skills the other does not, and when they combine their approaches it often leads to good results. Sam and Annie continue to not quite get it together in the tradition of all great TV will-they, won't-they romances, and Sam continues to be haunted by hallucinations of his life in 2006 which relate to his current situation in 1973. The show also moves onto slightly more contentious ground in Season 2 by covering the more controversial subject of IRA terrorism in one episode whilst continuing to examine the extent of corruption and heavy-handed methods in the 1970s police force.

In my review of Season 1, I mentioned that the show's continuous use of Sam's odd mental state occasionally gets a little exasperating, as sometimes you'd quite like to just see Sam and Gene butt heads and then solve the crime without Sam freaking out every twenty minutes. The producers play on this in two episodes in particular in the second season, one in which Sam doesn't have any odd experiences and starts getting worried about the lack of them, and another in which Sam reacts very badly to whatever is happening to him in the present and has to sit most of the investigation out. This latter episode, which is by far the most 'freak-out' intensive of the series, also perversely is one of the very best episodes, with flashbacks showing how they operated before he arrived (and giving rise to the unusual sight of scenes not featuring Sam, which feels odd as he is in every other single scene of every other episode of the whole series).

Of course, as good as the individual episodes are (and they are pretty damn good), the one episode that everyone will be left talking about is the very last one. British SF is awash with series-ending episodes that leave the audience reeling and talking about them for years or decades afterwards: Blake's 7, Sapphire and Steel and The Prisoner being the most notable (Quantum Leap's befuddling finale is probably the USA's closest equivalent). Life on Mars joins their august ranks with a finale that takes the viewer on a crazy existential rollercoaster ride as we finally get an answer for what is going on with Sam, but that answer is in turn supplanted by another, contradictory one in a manner that would make Christopher Priest proud. Which is the truth and which do we believe? The finale operates on multiple levels of reality with the viewer not quite able to trust what is going on. There is a very clear 'obvious' possible answer for what is going on, but just as with David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, that 'obvious' answer still leaves other, key questions unanswered.

Taken in isolation, Life on Mars' finale is very strong indeed. However, the news that a sequel/spin-off series was forthcoming which would shed more light on events did dilute the strength of that finale a bit, and Ashes to Ashes' plot developments have indeed plunged much of what we thought we knew from Life on Mars' finale into doubt. But further examination of that series is for another review.

The second season of Life on Mars (****) is thoroughly entertaining, funny, thought-provoking and just the right side of ambiguous. It draws a line under the series and sets up the sequel series quite nicely. It is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and will be released in the USA on DVD in November."
729,5.0,One of his best movies and suprised it didn't get more favorable reviews. Many scenes that you will never forget such as licking white dog poop or freaking out about not being able to watch shark week.
730,5.0,This movie is freaking awesome. Everyone that I know that's seen it couldn't stop laughing the ENTIRE movie. It is seriously one of the top 5 funniest movies of all time.
731,4.0,"OK, the Ultimate Collection is pretty darn good and WWE wants to suck old time fans like me out of some more cash so they're going through with this ""Definitive Collection"".

The first thing we need to say here is that I am hoping for a comprehensive documentary on Flair and his career and life.  We got a darn good one on the Four Horsemen DVD but on the Ultimate Collection, Flair just talks and introduces matches and angles and then they show them.  Sure, he gives us a little insight on the motivation at the time but a guy like The Nature Boy needs the full documentary treatment like Dusty, HBK, and Bret have had on their DVD collections.  Plus, they need to do this or it isn't going to sell as well as the Ultimate Collection did because a lot of fans are going to hate the inevitable overlapping of matches between the two DVD sets.

They need to have the 1993 Starrcade career vs. WCW title match with Vader on this new set.  That to me was the most glaring omission from the Ultimate Collection.

Also, bet your bottom dollar that the run-up to this past Wrestlemania and emotional final match with HBK will be on the new set because Vince knows we are all going to go out and buy the WM24 DVD for Flair's HOF stuff and the final match and then he can soak us again a few months later for the Definitive Collection.  Why, because Ric Flair is the freaking man.

Of course, my wife thinks i'm a total dork but she enjoyed the film too.  I thought this movie was going to suck hard which is why I apologized to her in advance for making her watch it, but what a great surprise it was when it turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've seen...."

This movie has just the right amount of humor and action to entertain adults while not freaking out the younger kids.  I've got to admit, I watched this movie once in the theatre and twice at home and enjoyed it each time.  Visually it is also a very well made movie.  Can't say Brendan Fraser is my favorite actor but this was the perfect role for him."

737,3.0,"Let's just get this over with.  If you like meaningless films where goofiness reigns supreme, JUMPER is your nirvana.  A young man named David (a bewildered-looking Hayden Christensen) discovers he has the ability to ""jump"" (teleport) from one location to another--anywhere in the world.  So what does he do?  Um, rob banks to set up a cushy lifestyle so he can pick up chicks by night in London and have lunch on top of the Great Sphinx of Egypt.

Heaven forbid young David would do anything constructive with such an extraordinary gift. . .

But wait.  There's more.  David discovers he's not alone; there are other jumpers out there (and they're all young adults; go figure).  And these jumpers are being pursued by paladins--sanctimonious Bible thumpers devoted to kill all jumpers because (we suppose, as we're never really given an explanation) they are ""evil.""  The paladins are led by a white-haired, very devout Samuel L. Jackson.  So, bewildered-looking David teams up with a fellow jumper (Jamie Bell, who is a not-so-nice jumper) to battle Jackson and the paladins--and that's when the goofiness takes over to the point poor girlfriend's (Rachel Bilson) apartment is totally trashed.

Oh, and the electric ""ropes"" the paladins use to trap the jumpers so reminded me of plumbing snakes.  Just an observation.

And the gorgeous Diane Lane is totally and utterly wasted in her brief appearances.  Yet I give this stinker three stars because director Doug Liman furnishes eye-opening vistas, visuals, and special effects to demonstrate at least someone brought some imagination to the set.

739,5.0,OM triple GGG!!!  What a great creep you out scary movie.  I went to bed with my lights still turned on. At first I thought this was going to be another one of those movies like paranormal inactivity but boy was I ever so wrong. I wanted to reach into my TV screen and yank the victims out before they were doomed. I had nightmares for two straight nights because of this movie.  Hat's off to the creators who did such a good job freaking me out like this. Just writing this review is beginning to give me goose bumps all over again. Little girl- stop staring at me from behind the door.

The highlight of this movie has to go to the beautiful, and sexy legendary actress, Pei Pei... She is so freaking hot!!!! I'd buy the bluray alone just for her!!!! Definitely a worthy Shaw brothers film, and I advise you to go seek this mutha out!!!"
741,5.0,"People like to compare ""remakes"" to originals with just cause, but really this movie has quite a bit to offer.
It's got some the greatest horror icons from the last 30+ yrs:

Malcolm McDowell, William Forsythe, Danielle Harris, Danny Trejo, Bill Moseley, Brad Dourif, Clint Howard, Dee Wallace, Ken Foree, and Sid Haig.

With some great characterization from new comers Scout Taylor-Compton, Kristina Klebe, Sheri Moon Zombie, Skyler Gisondo and Jenny Gregg Stewart (plays young Lindsay Wallace, who will blast your ears off with her freaking screams geez!).

This is brutal an raw if you want pg-13 horror look away, its got enough cuss words to rival Scarface and more than enough blood and gore to satisfy even Jeffrey Dahmer's eclectic tastes.

Like it or hate it is different, the basic structure is there but that's what made Halloween ""Halloween"" it'd be like Friday the 13th without the lake and counselors.

Watch a new spin on an old classic and take it for what it is; a homage, a re-imaging, and most of all a good time."
742,3.0,"This week we, Sid the Elf, decided to review the remake or whatever of the greatest horror film ever, Halloween. Now, we knew that this film was done by the ever-creepy Rob Zombie so we realized going in that things had a chance to get wierd or stupid but this one was ridiculous. It was a remake of the classic, kind of but not really. And the parts that were the same as the original were different here. Sounds confusing? Well how about watching this in an altered state trying to figure it out?

The bulk of the film concentrated on Michael Myers's early life and his rise to the top of the world of serial killing. The funniest parts of this movie came in the section where the evil stepdad was making fun of a young Myers calling him a freak and questioning his sexuality while Myers stands there taking it while wearing a homemade mask. It doesn't get much funnier than that. You also had young Myers making the ""I want to wrestle you so freaking bad"" face whenever anyone made him mad. Well, when he wasn't wearing one of his little masks. That was great. Also, young Myers offered us a couple of freakouts. The one when he went off on Loomis was awesome. If this movie was not a remake of a classic, and stood on its own, it would have made a pretty good horror B as all the elements were there. However, when you look at this film as the remake that it was, it fell way short.

First, Sid would like to talk to you about Loomis. In the original, he was the best part about the film. Who could forget such classic lines as, ""Tell your men to keep their eyes open and their mouths closed,"" along with many others. In the remake Loomis offered nothing, he had the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. He even exploited Myers's psycosis by writing a book and going on a speaking tour over it. Then, there was Laurie. In the first film, she was sweet and innocent and you really did not want Myers to catch her. This was one of the things that made the original. In the new version, she was trashy and annoying. Sid was hoping they would change the ending and have Myers strangle her by the 30 minute mark. Finally, there was Myers. In this one, he was a giant goon, which does explain his freakish strength and adds a lot in the way of unintentional comedy. But, he was so goofy. Sid even joked that Kane was playing him, only to find out that it was actually a more b wrestler that we'd never even heard of! Big Sky is the guy's name for the record.

So, this film was ok at best. That's factoring in all the unintentional comedy by goofy Myers, young Myers, and the stepdad; and the um, comedic mood Sid was in. Apperances by Clint Howard and Danny Trejo helped ease the pain a little. Oh, and the few times the film featured ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" was a pretty cool nod to the original and to more cowbell. But, Zombie's version concentrated too much on the gore of Myers' killings and his disturbed past really trying to drive home the fact that this man is totally insane. Yeah, we kind of got that by the huge killing spree, but I guess when you're Rob Zombie that's not really enough to classify someone as off the reservation. This one is probably only worth checking out if you've never seen the original and want to settle in with a decent horror B or if you just want to make fun of fat young Myers for a little bit. All in all 3 stars, not great, not bad. It insists upon itself, I like The Money Pit."
743,1.0,"This movie was absolutely horrible. I am such a big fan of the original version, but this one made me want to cry.

When I think of Halloween, there are many things that should have been incorporated into the movie. First, the scene where Micheal wears a sheet and glasses (which he does in this movie). Everything else was missing. There sould have been a scene where Laurie was in the closet and Micheal tried to get her. One other important thing is only being able to see his mask, as if it were floating in mid air. No scenes like this. Instead, they make him to be more like Jason from Friday the 13th. I love the Friday the 13th franchise, but his is Halloween. Micheal lurks in the shadows and surprises his victims, he does not use brute strength to tear through everything to get to the victim. I enjoyed the backstory idea, but I didn't like how they made his family trailer trash.

I really liked the young girl who played Laurie Strode. I am really happy that Rob Zombie did not make her like she was in the original version. In all honesty, there is no 17 year old girls like that in 2007. I am glad he made her spunky instead of Amish.
I also really liked how the mask was all aged and dilapidated. These were the only two good parts of the movie.

One things that really bothers me is that I felt like I was back in freaking 1972 throughout the entire movie. Every single male character had long hair. I thought they were all in a bad 1970 rock band. I understand that the movie probably starts out in the 80's, so the long hair would be expected. But when it is in present day, come on. Every single movie that Zombie makes is like a freaking music video because all the guys are like rock stars with long hair. THIS IS 2007.

Another things that bugs me is, yet again, this movie has the same cast from House 1,000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects. I honestly have not seen another movie with these actors in it, and there is probably a good reason for that: THEY CAN'T ACT. The exception is Sherri-Moon Zombie. I actually really liked her in this movie. But the rest, come on. They are freaking Z-List celebrities.

And lastly, I do not consider this a horror movie. I consider this a porn movie with Micheal Myers as a side character. Every five minutes there is a sex scene with naked women running around. It was so gross. Even the scene when Micheal escapes the sanitarium is because of a gross sex scene. (which I don't understand why the two men wish to do what they did to the poor woman in Micheal's room. This was a very weak scene.) Almost all of the main characters that die in this movie die right after or during having sex. The sex scenes overshadow the gore scenes. I mean, Micheal will be in the middle of killing someone, and suddenly it skips to a sex scene. When we come back, there is blood EVERYWHERE, and we don't get to see how this happened. I would much rather see the blood shed, and less porn. I mean, if I wanted to see a porn movie, I would rent one.

This movie was complete and utter trash. I really want everyone to watch the original Halloween instead of this stupid movie. Although, if you are in for a good porn flick, then I'd rent this one. But beware, the people in this movie aren't that attractive to look at!"
744,5.0,"So far everyone of Rob Zombie's movies have sucked in my mind, but this one. It took Zombie 3 years to make this movie what it is, a true masterpiece!

I can't wait till this comes out onto DVD in December, I hope it gets a two disc special unrated release!"

746,2.0,"This is a weird freaking movie. The only redeeming quality is that Ford is as yummy as ever. I think this movie may have some value in a timeline with other films but honestly, even though everyone says it's great, I just don't see it. It's weird and boring.

The spandex and/or Ford might keep your attention, but the plot won't."
747,1.0,"There's a big difference between Art and Story. The two do not necessarily preclude each other, but in movies, filmmakers tend to favor the latter over the former. This has resulted in wave upon wave of horrible film, granted. However, favoring the former over the latter hasn't resulted in any great shakes, either. In fact, both extremes often end with bewildered or annoyed audiences. However, when a story-based film fails, detractors have a much better time of it, because you can point to plot holes, inconsistent or incomplete characters, cheesy dialogue, or pure cliche. When an ""artsy"" film fails, however, the explosive force between its fans and haters gains extra force because, bottom line, it comes down to taste. Likewise with this film. It has as many glowing reviews as nasty reviews, and the bottom line isn't about the beauty, artistry, or skill of the film. It's about whether or not you believe depression can be an art form. I do not.

MELANCHOLIA, as a film, is almost exactly what it sounds like. It is a 136-minute-long gaze at depression. And that's it. Seriously. No, seriously.

Do you want a story? Well, fine then. How about this? A sister planet to Earth is discovered. It is named Melancholia (oooh!) and it is headed straight for Earth. If the two planets collide, then the entire human race is doomed. Also, a girl is getting married and she's very sad. The end.

Does it seem like I'm exaggerating? I am absolutely not. Kirsten Dunst plays one of the most annoying characters of her career (and that's saying a lot). She is part of a wealthy family on a wealthy estate that is holding a wealthy wedding between her and some other wealthy people. Inexplicably, she's depressed beyond words. The movie never explains why. ""Why"" is not the film's motif. Instead, it patiently and lovingly follows its tortured heroine as she weeps, falls motionless to the floor, or goes and sleeps with total strangers on her wedding night. Because she's so, so, so sad, you see.

This is art?

I'll admit, Lars Von Trier IS an artist, but if this is what he's going to apply his skill to, then I want none of it. The movie begins with a pastiche of ultra-slow-motion images set to classical music. I didn't time this section, but it seemed to last nearly twenty minutes (I'm almost certainly wrong). I thought every image was gorgeous and stunning, and I immediately knew that I was going to hate the film. Why? Because it announced, at the start, that it was EXCLUSIVELY about the lavishness of the imagery. Even that I could stand if I didn't have to endure another two hours of a pretty and entitled girl crying for absolutely no reason whatsoever. C'mon, Lars! Make it about a short order cook or an oil rig worker or a fifty-year old divorcee with diabetes. Characters with complexity and powerful lives -- these are people I might be able to handle roiling in self-pity for 120 minutes. A disaffected girl who might just be too rich and coddled? Please.

I did some research, desperate to understand why such a dismal wreck would ever be conceived, let alone put to film, and I read that Lars wanted to show multiple facets of depression. In other words, he wanted to show the good and the bad, how depression might be useful or workable under certain circumstances. How could that be? Well, it turns out that it is useful to be skilled at depression when the world is going to end. End of Deep Important Message.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

Yes. The world ends in the film, and part of Lars' message (if the interview is to be believed) is that Dunst's character's familiarity with abiding ennui made her especially suited to enduring the destruction of mankind. This is about the most ridiculous point a film could make, since the utter destruction of mankind renders moot the way any humans deal with it. Who freaking cares if someone deals with Earth's obliteration with suicide, grace and aplomb, selfish weeping, or some kind of drug-fueled orgy? In the end, you're left with one thing: the utter obliteration of mankind. For crying out loud, is this some kind of deep, insightful message?

I'm sorry. I probably sound bitter. I guess I am. I only bought and watched this movie after the endless praise it received from critics and friends, and when I returned to said friends with less-than-glowing remarks, I was told that I lacked patience, cared more about commercialism, or was too easily bored.

Nah. I like my movies to be about things. And if they're going to travel the path of artistic flair, I'd still like that art -- beautiful or not -- to teach me something either a) new, b) interesting, or c) profound. MELANCHOLIA's message is absolutely NONE of those things, and I will gladly debate anyone who says otherwise. You can film sadness as gorgeously as you want, but if the sadness is prompted by nothing, propelled by nothing, and ends in nothing, then the end result is exactly the same: a big, fat, zero."
748,3.0,"Warner didn't took advantage of the DVD format by adding the special features(like the theatrical trailer) and a 5.1 soundtrack. I had to tune up the volume up to 20 decibels(I own a home theatre system). The picture quality looks better than the 97 release though. I didn't buy this new DVD because I borrowed it from a friend and Warner did not do a good job with this years release. I hope next years release is better like the size of a mammoth loaded with lots of goodies. We'll see.

749,2.0,"...the ball was dropped on this film. Someone in Hollywood believed Brendon Fraiser and Jet Li in the same film would miraculously make this a winner. That someone should lose his job.

Synopsis: Ancient Chinese warlord is reawakened (along with 10,000 Terra Cotta warriors) to conquer the world. And there are Yetis....

The first two movies in the series were fantastically entertaining. You had action, emotion, love, despair, and discoveries of a linked past that made the movies engrossing. They had excellent scripts, beautiful effects, and acting that made it look real. I watch them over and over. This dog...well, at least I watched until the end.

Whoever cast this movie screwed the pooch. Fraser, as Rick O'Connell is, of course, excellent. I love the gung ho balls ahead character. He IS the character. In fact, he is the franchise.

Rachael Weisz declined to return citing problems with the script. Boy did she make the right call. So Maria Bello is cast as Evy. Dear God In Heaven. what where they thinking! Where Weisz played Evuy with emotion, perfect timing, and a boatload of sex appeal, Bello is a block of freaking wood who phones in her part. She has NO fluidity, no sense of timing, and not a trace of sex appeal. In fact, a block of wood could have done a much better job.

In the 2nd film, The Mummy Returns, the son, Alex, has a very strong `proper' English accent and typical `Brit' attitude. In this movie, Alex (Luke Ford) has NO trace of accent or his English upbringing. He plays the role like a young John Wayne, as if he was raised in Arizona. It totally fails.

Jet Li as Emperor Han...well, I loved him in Lethal Weapon 4, Unleashed, and The One. He should have done the role of Emperor Han with the same soft-sneering attitude he had in LW4. But he wasn't directed that way in this film. He was concrete, and wooden. There was no sense of surprise upon awakening 2000 years later. No marveling at the changes in the world. No wonder at how the world had changed. Totally unrealistic.

Redeeming factors: Michelle Yeoh (very big star in China) as Zi Yaun, the witch who betrays Han knowing his merciless character, Isabella Leong as her immortal daughter, and Russell Wong as General Ming Guo (Han's right hand man who falls in love with Zi Yaun). John Hannah plays Evy's gold-digging brother seamlessly from the prior films.

And there are the Yetis. Ya gotta love the Computer Graphics. At first, the Yetis were fluff, but then you start to like them. They are the `untarnished good' surrounded by evil.

The special effects are admirable. The battle scenes at the end are exceptional. The warriors (and Han) turning to sand and clay are so cool, myself and my friends all gave it a big `WHOA!'.

Rent it, just to see it. Own it, ONLY if you need to complete the series.

Hope this helps you decide."
750,5.0,"I pretty much thought rape could not be funny no matter what and it's not really. In any way shape or form rape is one of those things that just lacks comical value. And then I watched ""Hand Banana"". I think the people that make it might get high or maybe they did a lot of acid growing up. I don't know how these guys come up with this stuff. The writing is freaking great. The characters are all great. It's a great fuhking show, period. One of the most original and inspired TV shows ever. Don't let anyone deny it. It isn't remotely intended for everybody. Aqua Teen Hinger Force IS art.

Agree that season 5 is particularly for the already converted serious fans, and not the best season to start with. So, if somehow you haven't already been a fan for years now and haven't experienced earlier episodes go back to seasons 1,2,3, & 4."

752,4.0,"Hello. My name is Laurie. I'm 22 years-old. And I am...addicted to Gossip Girl. There. I said it.

I had read the Gossip Girl books back when they first came out. And I liked them. I never did end up finishing the series. So when I heard they were creating a TV show based on the books I was mildly interested. But I actually didn't end up watching it due to my own gripes with the CW network.

But I ended up catching the end of an episode posted on youtube (Victor Victrola) and was instantly intrigued. So I watched the previous episodes online. It moved a little slow at first, but it soon picked up. And by the time the next episode aired on TV, I was hooked!

Let me just say that this show is NOT anymore scandalous/provocative  than other TV shows! That's all hype that the CW lets build in order to create buzz around the show. So all these parental boards freaking out need to chill. You're kids have probably already seen worse- hate to break it to you.

Yeah the show can be silly and dramatized. That's half the fun! And its nice to escape my boring everyday life for an hour and get caught up in it! In my opinion, it blows the novels right out of the water!

Another thing I like about the show is the cast. They always seem to be down to earth and cool in real life, and I think they do a great job with the material they're given. Its VERY easy for some of the story lines to become cheesy and redundant (given its technically a TEEN drama), but they always seem to pull it off and make it seem believable.

My only con of the DVDs is that there is no cast commentary of an episode. I think that would have been a good feature to have! The bloopers, however, are pretty hilarious.

There's a reason there's so much buzz about the show with young and older audiences alike. And that is because it truly is an addicting show. And every week you find yourself more buried in it than the week before. Its a vicious cycle really...

I definitely recommend it. Season 2 starts September 1st on the CW and I've never been so happy to see summer end! I know its gonna be good.

You know you love it."
753,2.0,"I'm not going to bother reading positive reviews of this Swamp Thing series because those reviews could not make ths show watchable for me. I always loved the Swamp Thing comic, the original 70's magazine. The first Swampt Thing movie was OK, but this series was just awful. I actually have not seen anything quite this infantile before. I suppose if you are in grammar school then perhaps this sort of show might interest you. This series was just freaking bizzarre in my opinion. I give the show two stars for the great Swamp Thing costume and makes up. Sure, he's a little rubbery and jiggling in some places but ol' swampy looks like the real deal, and that look is very faithful to the comic book. This series, however, was simply unwatchable for this reviewer. I bought the set for perhaps $20 at Walmart. I watched four episodes. The show was just so awful to the point of retarding my senses. I give the show two stars for the special effects of the Swamp Thing.

Terrible show for people with functioning brain cells."
754,1.0,"Basically bad actress drives back and forth down a park road at night freaking out hysterically the whole time and all caught on a dash cam of a police vehicle. Dont expect to be scared. You will find yourself wanting something to happen but nothing really does other than a cop on a radio fighting the aliens in the town while the actress plays the stereo typical dumb blonde role, or yelling at the movie because the actress's acting is so horrible. They could have done so much more with this movie concept but I am guessing cheaped out on the budget. The worst part was that the credits are over 20 mins long, why? why ? i ask you, because they thought it would be artsy to play the spooky music while each credit gets its own slide. PLEASE..... So glad this was free. Id  say this is a movie you watch when there is nothing esle on and you really don't mind watching nothing at all or maybe you are on some sort of medication in a mental ward and everything in life scares you, this would be your movie."

756,3.0,"This film attempts to capture in very artful, often pretentious passes, the unexpected and blossoming romance between a heterosexual French married/family man and the nihilistic, philosophical neighbor that he and his wife invite to dinner while vacationing for the summer in Provence. The acting is uniformly superb and the cinematography is exquisite: I watched chiefly due to the setting in one of France's most extraordinary landscapes.

The problem is that the characters are very thinly drawn, not especially engaging, and the premise is ... well, not convincing at all when you consider what the plot demands of the actors and the outcome of the story itself. What we have is an attempt to look with great melodrama and angst at what is basically a French straight guy (the character 'Frederic') developing a slight man-crush on the neighboring gay guy (the character 'Hugo') after a night of heavy drinking and talking about the meaning of life 'til dawn at the vacation rental in Provence.

That's the problem: I didn't buy the notion that this sort of post-drunken man-crush would really evolve into something earth-shattering with the Hugo character. It seemed a stretch, given the way the script was written. The emotions tossed about in subsequent scenes have an arbitrary, random, and almost self-consciously ""artsy"" character that detract from exploring this theme more convincingly and, as a result, my feeling about the ending/denouement was essentially, ""You're all a bunch of stressed-out French people who've had way too much to drink and gotten way too much sun while on vacation, like most people. Is there *possibly* a chance you're all freaking out for no compelling reason? Chill out, lay off the booze, take an aspirin and have a nap before you all have to go back to Paris or Toulouse and rejoin the rat-race.""

Anyhow, that's the ultimate impression I had, without giving any spoilers away.

A subsidiary plot-line involving the Hugo character and his dying father was a much more interesting idea and ought to have been the center of the story, with the tepid little Frederic/Hugo thing being a minor side-plot. But overall this was an artful little French movie with fine acting, interesting camera work, and ambient scenes of Provence that almost make-up for the half-baked storyline. Almost."
757,5.0,I freaking love this show!
758,5.0,"I've been dying to see this movie since I first heard of it late last year.  Sure, we could talk all day about just how ""wrong"" this movie is, but why not sit back, toss those bunched-up PC panties aside for a freaking hour and a half, and enjoy the heck out of this hilarious zombie movie already enjoying a cult following.  And for what it's worth, name me one other movie that transforms the mentally challenged into heroes.  That's what I thought.  Anyway, Special Dead is just hilarious, not only milking numerous stereotypes for all they're worth, but kicking them once they're proverbially down.  The zombies are just downright disgusting, their grey skin peeling off in bunches, their mouths filled with meat, blood, dirt, and heaven knows what else, and their blood just waiting to shoot out in mini-geysers as soon as they're attacked.  I don't know what the chicken-eating zombie was actually eating, but it looked even nastier than the real thing.  Low-budget horror filmmakers could learn a lot from watching this movie.  Even the soundtrack, featuring the likes of Dark Reign and Eating Alice, is pretty kicking - although nothing tops Andy Allen's unique campfire song (there's even a sing-along version before the ending credits).

As the tagline says, ""Sometimes heroes ride the short bus,"" and in this case they ride it to Camp Special Dude owned and operated by Cameron ""Snuff"" Stone (Larrs Jackson, who was just hilarious, especially on the topic of zombie horses), who bought the camp years ago for a song - because, we soon learn, it was infested with zombies.  Snuff's second in command is his son Machiavelli ""Mack"" Stone (Jason Brubaker).  Mack only seems to care about making time with female counselors Cassie (Amy Wade) and Harley (Haneka Haynes), but he turns out to have real skills when it comes to dispatching zombies.  The ""special"" kids include Snuff's wheelchair-bound daughter Dale (Gia Franzia); Todd (Anthony Rutowicz), whose loud talking, hideous toboggan, and talent for making all kinds of things out of popsicle sticks do little to help him convince Dale to be his girlfriend; an uncommunicative mountain of flesh who could well be descended from Tor Johnson (David Reynolds); a shy ""helmet head"" (April Wade); and several others of less importance to the story.  Adding greatly to the fun is Eriq (Jah Shams), a young gangster bound for boot camp who was accidentally placed on the wrong bus.  All of the actors were darn near brilliant, if you ask me (especially Franzia and Rutowicz).

Don't write any of these characters off too soon, not even the most challenged among them.  While guys like Mack rely mostly on obvious weapons such as shotguns, sickles, numchuks - yes, numchuks - and good, old-fashioned bare fists, the campers tend to adopt more unconventional fighting methods.  Of course, not everyone can survive, so you get the additional treat of watching special campers taking on their now-zombified peers.  You may want to turn your head at one point, though, as Mack demonstrates a most disgusting, non-lethal zombie-controlling method.

Now, maybe you're thinking you won't see any sex or nudity in a film like this - well, think again.  You, along with some of the voyeuristic campers, will definitely see ""boobies"" at Camp Special Dude.  You'll also hear plenty of foul language (of course, if I were fighting for my life against zombies, I would be cursing up a blue streak, too).  For the most part, though, this is a genuinely original and creative film (a real rarity in the American-made horror genre).  Just remember that everything you see here is all in the name of gory fun.  Where else are you going to see a zombie with Tourette Syndrome?  Needless to say, some people will feel deeply offended and outraged by this film (and most of them will undoubtedly condemn it without ever seeing so much as a trailer), but Special Dead wears such sobriquets as ""the most offensive zombie movie ever made"" with pride.  I'll be enjoying this movie numerous times in the coming years."
759,5.0,"What a great later Lana double feature.

Great scene from PORTRAIT IN BLACK:
Lana Turner is required to drive a car, at night alone, as part of a murder plot but guess what? She can't drive!
So she tries anyway 'cuz she has to but has absolutely no concept of steering or braking or how to work the ""push-button"" automatic transmission.
She follows Anthony Quinn in the other car through the streets of San Francisco swerving and clueless as they barrel along. It starts to rain but she doesn't know from windshield wipers. Finally gets those going when the arms at a rail crossing come down right in front of her freaking her out and separating her from Anthony Quinn as the train goes by. It's a scream!

Great Madame X moment:
Lana Turner and Ricardo Montalban are dancing and Lana remarks how the she loves the mansion but worries about the plumbing. Ricardo makes a remark about the ""facade covering the corrosion"", referring to the house and the rich people at the upper crust party.

Both these films are a hoot. Enjoy them as such!"
760,5.0,"Oh this movie is just so sweet. Cute, funny, characters. Visual effects I loved freaking a lot. I think kids would enjoy watching it. It's one of my favorite movies of all time."
761,1.0,"Another direct to DVD sequel/prequel from Disney. Bland color palette and lack luster animation are the foundation of this latest installment to the little mermaid series.

The thing that stands out the most is the awful, awful musical score to a series where the original is known for having an amazing variety of songs.

Seriously, they have ""Jump in the Line (Shake Shake Senora)"" as one of the songs. Are you freaking kidding me? Not an original Disney creation, one of the crappiest swing songs I have ever heard. I seriously hate the **** out of that song and they play it like 2 or 3 times throughout the movie because it's practically the only song they have.

If you had fond memories of the Little Mermaid, you owe it to yourself to NEVER see this movie."
762,2.0,"Back in 08, when the movie came out on DVD, there was a huge buzz about it winning best screenplay and, so I decided I should check it out.

The movie is about a 16 year old girl named Juno MacGuff. I'm not kidding. I'm serious. Throughout the movie I tried to pretend that name wasn't the most pretentious female protagonist name I've ever heard but I failed. She talks like a real smartass and acts all cocky to people. She's 16 and is in love with Paulie Bleeker (again, another pretentious ""indie"" name). One day she finds out that she got pregnant from a time when she and Paulie had sex. She considers having an abortion, but after being forced to face the fact that once you make a decision it stays with you forever, she decides to come out about her pregnancy to her parents and give it up for adoption. She finds one family in a classified ad who has an infertile mother and goes to get to know them. She takes a keen kinship to the husband, who loves indie music and cinema, including one situation where they watch the 70s cheese horror flick ""The Wizard of Gore"". Then a bunch of drama and depressing indie pretentiousness ensues and... I... just... don't... freaking... care. The end.

I didn't HATE this film. Some lines were funny and I liked some of the cast, including the guy who played Jameson from Spider Man, Jennifer Garner, and Jason Bateman, who of course charms in each role. One particularly powerful scene was when Juno has an emotional breakdown in the van- Finally she acts instead of trying to be a teenager and spewing cocky words.

To say the characters are cardboard is an understatement- they're TISSUE PAPER THIN. Juno is not likable at all. Why should I sympathize for her? She's just a smartassed cocky borderlining-on-bitch who has absolutely no reason to be in the story other than the fact that she's the protagonist and she's pregnant. And her constant pop culture references were don't help either. Paulie I have no respect for- come on, getting a girl knocked up before she's even old enough to drive has no respectability in it, and the movie tries to make me care about him by making him all ""cute"" and ""awkward"" but come on. Also, this film in a way almost glamorizes teen pregnancy- Their parents are cool with her being pregnant AT 16 (I've known people in this situation and trust me, their parents were the exact opposite of that). There's much more but it would be too long to list. Oh and for the record, I don't think I've EVER heard anyone say ""Pork swords"".

I don't even think creepy looking assassins with stupid haircuts and silenced shotguns could have saved this film. It's not terrible but I honestly don't get why it's so praised."
763,1.0,"That's it, I've had it. I've seen so many of these anime shows where either they ran out of budget, tried to cram a complete series of manga's into half the episodes, or just really lazy ""wrap it up"" story telling. I just want to make a note to all the animators out there. If you can't make a complete well thought out anime DON'T EVEN BOTHER! It's a waste of my time.

If you can't tell Tokko happens to be one such Animie. ""The Complete Series""? ""COMPLETE!?!"" this is the laziest animation I've ever seen. For 7 episodes nothing really happens matter of fact I was plain out bored. Then finally the last 6 become interesting and it just ends abruptly in the middle of a climatic battle. Don't get me wrong, this is far from ""BERSERK"". Although I hated that ending we at least got fulfilling episodes. The ending really just a way to push you into the manga where the story continued.

However Tokko, jeez! What's the point of this series? It's too short, the first episodes are too long and drawn out,and when it gets to the point when it starts to become interesting it just ends. Normally this is the type of anime that needs 24 or 48(2 seasons)episodes to fully play the story out. At best this is forgettable and trust me it will be forgotten there's nothing about it that really stands out aside from the girl who doesn't wear a bra and the ending that ticked me off.  People watch anime for the entertainment value and especially the story. What's the point of watching something that just ends right in the middle?

Imagine watching Starwars and as soon as Luke meets Darth Vader for the final battle they cut to a shot of the Deathstar exploding and roll the credits. That's this freaking anime! Why even bother making this? There's no point! Nothing happens to hold your interest and I could careless if there's a manga available for this. The story wasn't good enough for anyone to consider wasting their time to find a manga and try to read it just to figure out if Tokko is decent or not.

1 Deathstar for this crap! I'm putting my foot down. Good concept terrible execution. This anime should never have been made. Completely pointless!"
764,4.0,"okay, i know why it's part two, but it's a whole nother movie. strong film, and i think it's up there with the first one. i thought it was going to bite big time because you know sequals usually do, but this one sure did not. from the opening scene, through the heartache, to the supernatural, all the way to the end. it opened with a bang, and goes out with a bang. really a very good show no doubt. here's how it goes, a man who has a near death experience, due to a tragedy, returns with a whole new outlook. and that's not all. he comes back with a gift, or a curse, depends on how you look at it. he is able to tell when someone is going to die. will he be a hero, and save the day or let destiny run it's course. aside from freaking out because of all this and trying to deal with it, he tries to do the right thing, or so he thinks. along he finds someone who he forms this bond with, but what cruel fate is. he never saw it coming. he didn't ask for this, but as the movie rolls on he realizes what it all means, what he must do, what he shouldn't have done. where there is the living, there is the dead, and where there is good there is always evil. it's a bit of a roller coaster ride, and will take you down that road of do you believe or do you not. sometimes it's better to leave fate alone. the actors were great, the ghosts were a very nice and creepy, and the whole deal was time well spent. it had it's BOO moments that i so love. abe, played by nathan fillion, is an excellent actor. great performance and nice emotion. as for the leading lady sherry, played by katee sackhoff, was pretty good. she was the other half of this film. these actors had great chemistry which helped the film as well. two thumbs up."
765,4.0,1980's insider trading freaking cool
766,2.0,"I went into this movie knowing its insane backstory -- how director Richard Kelly (the man behind ""Donnie Darko"") was given ""carte blanche"" during the production, how he plotted a multimedia franchise that included a website and graphic novel prequels, how the film was panned at the Cannes Film Festival, and how it eventually sank into obscurity, taking Kelly's directorial career with it.  I had heard how it was supposed to be a barbed political and social satire, an allegory of the Book of Revelations, and a bold love letter to Philip K. Dick.  And I also heard how many people, from Internet critics to the very actors who starred in this thing, couldn't even begin to tell you what it was about.  And yet all this information just whetted my curiosity -- I had to know for myself whether it was as bad and insane as they said.

I can't say that I enjoyed this film, nor will I watch it again.  And the critics were right -- it's pretty bad and confusing.  And yet it'll stay with me for a long time, and will probably garner a cult following among people who enjoy weird cinema.

""Southland Tales"" takes place after a nuclear attack on Texas (who perpetrated said attack is never explained).  In the wake of the attack, the government declares martial law and turns the United States into a totalitarian state, while a wealthy scientist (Wallace Shawn) sets out to make a fortune from an ocean-generated power source he calls Fluid Karma in the hopes of usurping the oil industry.  The government is struggling to maintain an iron grip on the country and on the Internet, while a group of rebels calling themselves the Neo-Marxists fight to overthrow said government.  In the meantime, Fluid Karma is somehow ripping holes in the fabric of time and space, a fact the scientist is trying to both exploit and cover up.  And while all THIS is going on, an amnesiac actor (Dwayne Johnson) with ties to a powerful senator is teaming up with a porn star (Sara Michelle Geller) to write a screenplay that he hopes will change the world... if it doesn't destroy itself first.  Add Justin Timberlake as a brooding, Bible-quoting military sniper, Sean William Scott as twin brothers tentatively allied with the Neo-Marxists, Christopher Lambert as a crazy arms dealer peddling his wares from an ice cream truck, and a slew of ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni peppering the cast, and you have insanity on your hands.

Yeah, it's hard to describe this movie, because there's just SO freaking much going on.  It's difficult to know who's working with who, something not helped by the fact that alliances keep changing and betrayals keep popping up.  The director seems to think that packing everything he can possibly think of into one film is the best way to go, but all that does is make the movie a tangled and convoluted mess.  (The fact that the movie is only the second half of the story doesn't help -- Kelly expects people to read the graphic-novel prequels before watching the film, though said graphic novels were out of print by the time the film hit theaters.)  And the movie is NOT shy about throwing all kinds of symbolism and political commentary at the screen, mostly bashing Republicans and the Bush administration, and you get the feeling that the whole movie is trying to say something but thinks it's being smart by relying on allegory and metaphor to do it.  Sometimes this can work... but here it just makes an already confusing movie nearly impenetrable.

I do give the actors in this movie credit for trying, though many of them look rather bewildered as they play, as if they're not quite sure what's going on themselves.  Dwayne Johnson and Sean William Scott look particularly confused throughout the film, though it's hard to tell how much of this is their characters and how much is them going ""what on Earth did I sign up for?""  Some actors, like Sara Michelle Geller, seem to be phoning in their performances, while others, like Kevin Smith, Wallace Shawn and most of the SNL players, decide to have fun with their roles and ham it up as much as possible.  The actors who nail their roles the best would have to be Justin Timberlake and John Lovitz (the latter playing a cold-blooded murderous cop).  Both bring a sinister-ness and unexpected level of depth to their roles, and are surprisingly good actors for being a boy-band star and a snarky comedian respectively.  I wouldn't mind seeing either of these two in more dramatic roles in the future.

I see three major flaws with this movie aside from the confusing, convoluted plot.  The first is that the film is unable to stand on its own -- yes, the graphic novel prequels and the websites might give more information, but I shouldn't have to read a comic book to ""get"" a movie.  For a comparison, the movie ""Pacific Rim"" has a lot of information not included in the movie that adds to the experience, including graphic-novel prequels, but these aren't required reading to understand what's going on onscreen.  They're extras that people can enjoy once they're done with the film.  When a movie's incomprehensible without extra material outside the film, it's a failure in my eyes.

The second flaw is the director's ""throw everything at the screen and see what sticks"" approach to filmmaking.  I haven't seen ""Donnie Darko,"" so I don't know if that's his usual style, but here I get the feeling that Kelly couldn't bear to cut any ideas out of his screenplay and so just jammed everything he could into a single film.  Political satire, social satire, dystopian sci-fi, Biblical allegory, pop-culture parodies, apocalyptic thriller... this film tries way too much for even its generous two-and-a-half-hour runtime, and as such no single aspect gets the attention it deserves.  The entire film feels like several films cut apart and haphazardly stuck together, and that makes for a frustrating viewing experience.

The last flaw is the egocentric smugness that practically drips from every second of this film.  Despite the incomprehensibility of this film, it's very clear that Kelly had something to say, something he considered important enough to rub into the viewer's face at every opportunity.  And yet he didn't want to come right out and say it, but cloak it in metaphor and symbolism so he could crow ""you all just don't GET my genius!"" when questioned about it.  Maybe I'm alone in feeling this way, but I couldn't help but sense the director's arrogance as I watched, a nagging feeling that the director felt that if I couldn't understand his message, I just wasn't smart enough to appreciate his work.

Still... for all the confusion, madness, and director's ego that stank up this film, I know I'm not going to forget it anytime soon.  There's a weird sort of fascination that accompanies this movie, the sense that I'll never watch anything quite like this again.  It's a bizarre mishmash of sci-fi, satire, Biblical allegory, and passion project that throws weird scene after weird scene at the screen, and while these weird scenes rarely work, they do stick in one's mind, for better (Justin Timberlake's out-of-nowhere but memorable ""All These Things I've Done"" music video smack in the middle of the action) or for worse (the car commercial... just don't ask...).

It's hard to know who to recommend this film to, because I think most people would find it difficult to enjoy.  I'd say if you're a fan of bad or weird cinema, and you don't mind watching a movie and having no idea what's going on, give it a shot.  If nothing else, enjoy it for the madness of what's playing out onscreen, and the absurdity of seeing actors in roles that are completely against type.  Myself, I probably won't watch it again, and I can't say I really enjoyed it, but I'm certainly going to be thinking about it for a long time.  So I guess, in that respect, Kelly succeeded in making a memorable film, even if it's memorable for the wrong reasons."
767,3.0,"On a scale of one to five, I only give ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" three stars...and that's being incredbly generous.

I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this film, and there are moments of the movie that are absolutely fantastic. The problem is that all those scenes start off great, and then fizzle out into nothing spectacular. This film also cuts and changes a lot of info from the book, and changes certain things from the novel that had no business being changed. I just don't understand it.

Without giving too much away, here are some of the things that irked me about this movie (if you haven't read the book, though, beware that there are spoilers ahead):

 - The first 20 minutes or so of the film are AWFUL. They are nothing like the opening chapters of the book, which is a huge disappointment. Dumbledore especially bothers me at the beginning of the movie. His dialogue is ridiculous, and the significance of his withered hand are glossed over in an offhand remark to Harry. (Also, that hand looks nothing like it should. In the movie, Dumbledore's hand looks like its owner has merely been outside gardening for a couple of hours. In the book, the hand is supposed to be a black, charred, disgusting mess. Why cut corners on the big screen?)

- Also in regards to the first few minutes of the book, I was disappointed that the Snape/Narcissa/Bellatrix scene was pushed back until later in the film, and was exceptionally brief. It could have been much better.

- Too much of the movie was devoted to silly romance. Don't get me wrong: The Ron/Hermione/Lavender triangle was a big part of Book Six, and the actress playing Lavender in the film was absolutely hysterical. However, too much time was devoted to teenage romance instead of other important plot elements that were completely cut out  of the film altogether.

- Speaking of silly romance, the Harry/Ginny relationship was really shafted in the movie. It started off well, but never really climaxed at all. At the end of the book, Harry and Ginny are officially an item, and there's a very poignant moment where Harry tells Ginny why they can't be together because he'll inadvertently put her in danger and because he needs to fulfill his destiny, etc. That scene was completely omitted from the movie, and in the film, you really don't know if Harry and Ginny are really together or not. It's ridiculous!

- Fenrir Greyback's character in the movie was a MASSIVE disappointment. He appeared in the film, but no one even really knew that he was a werewolf, because the whole scene where he attacks Bill Weasley was omitted from the film! Why include the character at all if they were going to cut that scene? It makes absolutely no sense!

- Too much time was devoted to Draco Malfoy practicing for his ""grand event."" Tom Felton did a great job portraying Draco in this film, but seriously, did the filmmakers really need to include four or five separate scenes of Draco practicing using the vanishing cabinet? I don't think so.

- For me, the last 25 minutes or so of the film were the biggest disappointment of all. The worst part about it is that certain aspects of these scenes were amazing: the visual setting when Dumbledore and Harry arrive at the mouth of the cave, the dialogue between Snape and Dumbledore at the tower, etc. Unfortunately, though, the scenes that started off great ended up sucking. For example, the ""evil souls"" living in the lake were total rip-offs of Gollum from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and didn't look anything like I imagined that they should. Also, I hated the death scene at the end, which was poorly done and happened way too quickly. The Snape/Harry confrontation at the end of the film also seemed incredibly lackluster. I really wanted Harry to scream at Snape and go nuts on him, but instead Daniel Radcliffe just kind of muttered, ""Coward,"" and that was it.

- The ending of the film was TERRIBLE! After the death, only about 30 people were gathered around the body, and no one was freaking out the way they do in the book. HELLO! One of the most important characters in the series is dead! Doesn't anyone care? All they do is hold their wands up in the air for a few seconds in some sort of pathetic salute. It's awful! It was so subdued. And where was the funeral?! In the book, people travel from all over the world to attend the service, and the coffin goes up in white flames, which would have been a great way to end the movie. Instead, the audience was left with a boring shot of the back of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads. It was awful!

I really expected more from this film. Again, I will concede that there were some decent moments, but I think the script and the overall direction were severely lacking. I really hope they don't screw up the final two films in the series. Warner Brothers Execs, if you are reading this, I hereby volunteer to adapt the screenplay for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" and to direct both movies for free just to make sure they are done right!"

769,5.0,"Romance & Cigarettes (2005) James Gandolfini, Susan Sarandon, Kate Winslet, Steve Buscemi
Rated R.
Finally a romantic comedy musical for real He men! And it's about freaking time!
Offbeat and tweaked, and totally bent. Dripping with cigarette smoke, beer fumes and guy sweat.
And the lusty lure of women in red.
For manly men only. No girls allowed.
Prudes beware.
Plenty of classic songs punctuate the procedings throughout.
Buscemi is positively hilarious.
Somebody, anybody, please, oh please,  pinch me. And pinch me hard.
Bizarre choreography abounds, along with the twisted humor.
Very much a one of a kind Indie film. Oddball characters spring out of nowhere.
Kate Winslet is just as gloriously sexy as she could possibly be. I vote her the sexiest redhead alive. She is literally mouth watering in her bad girl role.
Through it all the movie does have its serious side, too, as a husband and his wife and their daughters all go through marital and family issues.
Probably the most unusual musical comedy/drama you will ever see. Ridiculously outrageous and outrageously ridiculous.

The setup for the film is quite nice.  Rumley creates a soft-spot for the audience in James and his father.  Early scenes show James freaking out and his father lovingly taking care of him.  Later, as James begins to put his mother's life in danger, we do not feel so much angry with James, but rather we feel sorry for him.  This film is less about the danger faced by Nancy, and more about the sadness of James' strong desire yet incapicity to care for his mom.

Unfortunately, the main story ""ends"" about midway through the film, and the final act begins to fall apart.  James' psychosis begins to go into overdrive, and he has one of the strangest hallucinations I've seen in film.  Later, his father goes similarly nuts, and it begins to become difficult to follow the storyline.  By the end, it was difficult to tell who had done what to whom, and how much of what we saw really took place, and when.  This muddled final act undoes all the good the first half had set up.

Performances are good across the board, with Leo Bill having the most difficult job of the three bringing James' psychosis to life.  The character he creates is nearly laughable in the early portions of the film (think an amalgamation of the characters Rick and Vyvyan from the UK TV series, THE YOUNG ONES).  As the film progresses, the odd mannerisms become equally frightening and heartbreaking.

If Rumley had stretched out the middle portion of the film a bit longer, and had a more comprehensible ending, I might have recommended the film - as it is, it is largely a disappointment.  I give it three stars for good acting and an interesting opening portion.

Take Note: while there is only a sparse amount of gore and no sex or language, the film has some disturbing thematic moments between the mother and son as he tries to care for her."
772,4.0,"""Old fashioned"" may be a relative term regarding horror movies, of whom I count myself a fan. But it gets harder and harder to find something I can really watch; unlike a lotta newbies to the genre, I really don't want to find the most bloody and realistic depiction of chainsaw massacres.

I like horror movies that surprise, that are clever, that are pure escapism. The worst and most horrific blood and gore isn't my idea of a horror movie. That's just stupid, or maybe I should say adolescent (which is why it's adolescent boys who constantly yammer for more and more.)

Hatchet is made for folks like me: people who remember when going to a horror movie was FUN, and not just an exercise in blood and gore.

Don't get me wrong, though. There's plenty of blood and gore in Hatchet, but it's the fake kind, and yeah, that's on purpose. The liner notes (so to speak) say this movie was created as a paen to 80s-type horror movies, and that is definitely true.

But Adam Green, the writer and director, wanted to make a movie that would be an updated version of 80s-style slashfests. He succeeded admirably.

The movie is just fun. One of the rules of these type of movies is that anyone who has sex is gonna GET it. And yeah, they do. There are two slutty chicks, one a Valley girl, and the other a faux NYU acting school graduate with pretensions of ""art"" who are making a ""Girls Gone Wild"" soft porn movie with a sleazy director. There is the boring older couple, constantly invoking the name of Jayzus; the requisite black guy with great expressions; a Chinese or Korean or Filipino guy (our token Asian) who also pretends to be a Cajun tour guide; and the hero, the resident geek.

The heroine is a plucky southern chick, combing the swamp for her white trash daddy and brother (parts filled respectively with 80s horror icon Robert Englund, otherwise known as Freddie from Nightmare on Elm Street and Joshua Leonard, the guy whose teeth turned up in a bag of rags and twigs in 'Blair Witch Project.')

Hatchet is cliche-ridden, and freaking funny and fun as hell. The extras with this DVD are fun, too (which is amazing, since it's so rare to get DVD extras that actually are as good as the movie!)

Totally recommended for the 80s horror flick fan!"
773,5.0,"I walked away from the first viewing of this film with just about everyone else's reaction, WTF? After getting over what I thought the film should be and accepting what it was, I found that I needed a second time around to have an unbiased oppinion of the film.
 I loved this movie, I have found that as much as liked the 07 installment, I have to go with this one as the great denoument that really pushes the violence to the level that Michael needs to be at, unbound and raw, a souless killing machine, a sympathetic monster.
 Granted this movie is chuck full of continuity errors and annoying acting, but I for one came to see Michael do his thing and I got just that. The death scenes were the best I've seen so far, that first nurse's death made me feel both perspectives of a murder from the killer and victim perspective that it set my teeth on edge. Also let's not forget the great look and feel of a Halloween based Haddonfield that has not been topped in any Halloween film before, I'm still searching as to where I can find the giant evil pumpkin king decoration at the party scene.
 I think everyone's major problem with this as was mine at first is that this film is not what you expected from the series, like the original Halloween 3 it is a different film that really sets the essence of Halloween in full.
 One more thing, why the beard? Why the hair in the face in the last film? BECAUSE THESE ARE MASKS TOO! The shot of Tyler Mane's face when the little kid bumps into him on the street is freaking scary, he looks like a stone cold crazy very effectively.
 The bottom line is, see this film. If you didn't like it because it wasn't what you expected, see it again, you might be suprised at what you think about it after leaving your preconceptions at the door.
Hoping for a director's cut on Blu Ray and excited to see H3."
774,1.0,"Another Seagal film and another waste of my time! If the movie was 20 minutes long it would be one of the greatest action films of all time. I can't stand these low budget films, I hate how instead of giving us what we want we're subjected to seeing Seagal walk around talking and smiling for 90 minutes. If the man could act, if the script was well written, then it would be a different story. When we do get action, it's mostly body doubles. The only good thing about this film is the final shootout at the graveyard. It was done like a pro but they obviously put their entire budget into that and relied on the script and Steven for the rest. The movie is a failure and should be avoided.

I also saw Van Damme's new film The Shepherd which comes out the same day and it was freaking spectacular. It was filled with martial arts, high octane car chases and tons of action. Why can't Seagal give us that?"
775,4.0,"With Michaeal Gross, Chris Atkins and Greg Evigan.
This could be a sequel to Journey To The Center Of The Earth or a prequel ?
Maybe that's not fair,This is supposed to be a bigger film and has more success already on Sci-Fi Channel.
Great cast, Script has some true moments and plenty of special effects.
Michael Gross( from TREMORS) has some sparks with a character that is allowed to breathe life into a mad scientist role.
Greg Evigan(BJ & THE BEAR) I believe was filming two movies a t once, And is noticeably In/out Burger-ish.
Christopher Atkins(DALLAS) has fun scenes and the major love interest for one of few females along for the trek.
We are disheartened on two points-
 Griff Furst ,WHY WAS your name removed as director ?
The second, Saw these great behind the scenes on raptor and execution lacked, But T-REX was' freaking beacon of hope for kewl  visuals'.
Producers give more work to Stephen Blackehart , Geoff Meed  and Eric Spudic ,'Wow' gentlemen !"
776,5.0,"I don't understand how people are giving this less than five stars this is a great ppv and a great wrestlemania maybe the best

finlay and little horny vs jbl we start with the belfast brawl which was a pretty good hardcore match bad storyline but good opener it got me into the show they used a lot of hardcore toys and it was great until the finish which was pretty weak at least to me it was 4.5/5

mitb chris jericho vs shelton benjamin vs john morrison vs carito vs cm punk vs mvp vs mr kennedy this is the best mitb at least to me it is just awesome all the spots and it moved along perfectly but the best spots are morrison's moonsault with a ladder, benjamin's bump on the ladder, matt hardy comin in and his cutter off the ladder on mvp, carlito's back breaker of the ladder, the tower of doom off the ladder and morrison's bump on his crotch 5/5

umaga vs batista i was with the people in the front rows u u umaga u u umaga but of course this is the wwe and of course at wrestlemania because he lost last year batista had to have a win umaga beats him up the whole match and batista hits a spinebuster like always and then botched his sit out powerbomb which looked cool but at least he didn't kill our fatu 3/5

ecw championship kane vs chavo guerrero and off course i agree with everyone else o wait no i don't this is stupid it almost killed the whole show 1/5 for the good chokeslam

shawn michaels vs ric flair now thank god they had this match now it saved the show from dieing and it is the second best match of the card it is great some real good chops and some leg locks from both men and ric flair finally hits his diving cross body from the tope rope and also look right after hbk hit him with the superkick the last time he starts crying because he knew that this was the finish to his last match 5/5

maria and ashley vs beth phoenix and melina now i don't know what is so wrong with this match it is a pretty good womens match if you look at the playboy team it is there best match for both but not for wrestlemania 2.5/5

wwe chamipionship john cena vs hhh vs randy orton this is a pretty good match and a lot better than what i was thinking it was going to be but still felt like it could have been better but it was a little over ok and at least it wasn't main event 4/5

big show vs floyd mayweather it was so much better than i thought it would be and i find it very good fun to watch and i never got bored with the match but again a least mayweather didn't beat show cleanly like i thought he was going to be so that makes me feel better that paul didn't come back just to get buried right when he came back 4/5

world heavyweight championship undertaker vs edge o my freaking goodness this is one of the best wrestling matches i have ever seen they put on one heck of a show counter after counter and false finsh after false finish it is just one of the best matches i have ever seen and when i saw it for the first time to me it istantly became in my top ten best matches 5/5 and its a show stealer

76% which is a pretty good grade

the other match is a bad battle royal but the hof was really good this year so watch it also the best ppv for tna and wwe since bound for glory 2007 which is one of the best shows i have ever seen so if you don't have this or that buy them both great great shows"
777,1.0,"I just finished watching ""Inside"". I found it by googling French horror movies and someone recommended ""Inside"". I looked it up and it seemed to have gotten rave reviews so I decided to buy it. It's a story about a pregnant woman who gets into a car accident, she loses her husband but her baby is fine. She is depressed and generally mean. The night before she gives birth a strange woman appears at her house, and things get blood, gory, and violent.

That's basically the entire movie. It is pretty much a mindless gore fest with some artsy fartsy lightening and scenes at times.

Pacing: The pacing was very slow at the beginning, the opening credits were too long and nearly put me and everyone else to sleep. The beginning was also slow and sleep inducing. Only when the stranger appears that the movie begins to pick up and delivers on its promise of ""scary""

Scare rating: Not very high overall. 1 out of 10 and I'll give it a 3 or 4 for when the stranger first appears. The scenes were well done. However, after the stranger is in the house and things get gory the less scary the movie became.

Plot: The movie over all was kind of stupid, the characters did stupid things that just simply made the plot carry on but made no logical sense at all. The stranger drives a pair of scissors through the pregnant woman's hand and she doesn't scream at all despite the police being right downstairs?  One police officer doesn't bother to cuff her right away, he just stands there then lets her grab a weapon? The pregnant woman doesn't cooperates with the police that do arrive. i get it, she is traumatized but seriously she doesn't alert the police to her presence et al even when they are right at the door to get her. A police officer brings a perp into the house with him? wth. But nothing tops the random police offer turned ZOMBIE for no freaking reason!

The police never call for back up, and are pretty much funneled in to be killed.  They leave the pregnant woman alone to find a breaker box while the killer is nowhere to be seen yet all they have to do is escort the victim outside and put her in the police car! Oh yeah and call for back up! suddenly the victim goes to the front door and cannot not unlock it to leave, even though she is INSIDE the house and can just turn the freaking lock and go.

Everyone eventually started laughing at the silly over the topness of this movie and just wanted the pregnant woman to die already so this movie can end.

The only thing that kept us watching was to find out if the movie had any saving grace, it didn't. It's a mindless gore fest, parody like, and nothing more. if this movie was made in the U.S. It would get nothing but one and two star ratings and dismissed as a bad American horror movie with no plot."
778,3.0,"There were two movies that came out in 2008 which probably rank among the worst in history, this one and Punisher: War Zone.

This movie sucks.  You can pretty much ignore what every character says and just insert something you know from Lord of the Rings or Willow.  You'll be close enough that it won't matter.  Better yet, just watch it in German.  It is after all the director's native language.  As for the plot, again, just make up your own details from what you've read and seen.  You can see the formula revealed without much effort.

""But you gave it three stars, dip****!!""

Yes, and here's why.  This film is a monument to bad filmmaking, a milestone that may never be surpassed.  It's a clash of opposites though because it is an incredibly expensive, slick production.  I would call it one of the most well-made bad movies ever.  So much effort and expense went into casting, action sequences, choreography and special effects that it should have been good, but Boll made it awful, so awful that I had to keep watching to see how much more awful it was going to get.  Here's a quick breakdown:

Farmer's name is Farmer and he's hero Jason Statham (possibly the only good casting choice).

Farmer's friend is Ron Perlman who for some reason isn't cast as creepy bad guy.

Creepy bad guy is Ray Liotta, which doesn't make sense because he's got in Irish blood in him so he could never be a made man (It's Ray freaking Liotta in a freaking Fantasy movie, what can you say to that!?).

The role of Gandalf will be played by Gimli, son of Gloin.

The role of Arwen/Eowyn will be played by Leelee Sobieski, who is young, pretty and maybe talented, but honestly, the fact that she is in it at all should tell you it's a bad movie.  She may consider finding a new agent.

It's a fantasy movie and Burt Reynolds is in it.  Why?  Because they could, I guess.

Burt Reynolds's toadie is Matthew Lillard, which should be another tip-off that it will be a bad movie.

So the hero decides to be a hero, fights some nondescript bad guys, rallies more people to fight nondescript bad guys, then it all comes to a head and they all fight the one descript (well, if nondescript is a word...) Ray Liotta (Ray Liotta?? Seriously??).  Lots of fighting and dialogue reminiscent of Star Wars prequel trilogy (low blow, I realize that) ensue along the way.

In two words, it's heroicly bad.  If you are a real movie buff, you HAVE to see this movie just to see how bad it is.  It's as if you're watching bad film history unfold before your eyes.  That is the only reason I give it a positive rating, because for better or for worse (mostly worse), it's worth seeing."
779,5.0,"This is probably a 4-star movie at best, but I'm giving it extra because:

1) It's not gratuitous with violence or language, and has no sex
2) It doesn't waste my freaking time with superfluous footage, long intros, extensive backgrounds, dull dialogue or any other filler crap.
It gets to the point and gets it done.
3) As others mention, I love the ""Rashomon"" or ""Run Lola Run"" format
of different perspectives on the same event.

Sure, it's over the top in parts, extremely coincidental in others, or just plain unbeleivable at times, but it's a nice little family type thriller that pushes the pedal down and gives a good ride.  Hell, that's something that's hard to find at Blockbuster these days.  Props!"
780,4.0,"This Brittish horror comedy starts out as a botched kidnapping for the first half of the film. It starts with two brothers(David and Peter) kidnapping the daughter of a gangster and taking her to a cabin out in the woods. They ask for a ransom of 100 thousand which is brought to them by the girl's stepbrother(Andrew) who is also in on the kidnapping. However he failed to check the case the money was supposed to be in and realizes it was empty after reaching the cabin. Meanwhile the gangster was aware of the stepbrothers involvement and sends two asian hitmen after them. The first half of the film plays out more like a black comedy and a thriller. Peter is shown to be incompetent in his task and ends up getting his nose broken by the girl using a headbutt on him while being tied up. Peter also has a severe case of moth phobia shown through several humorous scenes of him freaking out in the presence of a moth. The stepbrother Andrew is shown to be a complete moron by not checking the suitcase for money and also buying himself a facemask that doesn't even cover his face.
David drives over to a nearby town to call the gangster and demand his money. While he is in town the first signs of a horror film start to show. The townsfolk act strangely around him and warn him about what happens to strangers in the area. David returns to the cabin to find only Andrew fainted with Peter and the girl gone. At this point it would look like the two hitmen were responsible but are later shown to be only a red-herring as a body with a slit-throat of one of them is found. David and Andrew and Peter and the girl each encounter the real killer of the film, a deformed backwoods farmer that stalks them for the rest of the film. The plot twist in the middle of this film can be compared to ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" with a hostage thriller quickly turning to a vampire film except in this it quickly turns into a hillibilly slasher type film.
While this no ""Dead Alive"" as far as blood and gore there are some good bloody kills in the movie and the gore level rises a lot in the second half. A difference this film has from other backwoods slasher films like ""Wrong Turn"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is that the killer didn't become the way he is from inbreeding or radiation like in the other films. The Farmer was deformed in a machine accident that ended up disfiguring his face. The idea of a a backwoodsman going on a killing spree isn't exactly otiginal but this movie is different enough from the usual to not make it tired or cliche. Overall this is a fun and entertaining horror comedy film that is recommended for fans of horror comedies, British horror, or horror films in general."
781,5.0,"I highly recommend this production. With some wonderful sets this beloved opera , to me my favorite Mozart- has been placed in a WWI ""reality"". Here was an opportunity to have opposing armies come together for a little Christmas party thanks to the transforming effect of the magic fltue and chime box of Papageno. You ought to be somewhat bedazzled by the technical difficulty of this set design. I have no problem with the concept at all..rather nice, , in fact, I'd like to see even more imaginative productions like this one...the Swedish version by reknown film maker Ingrid Bergman is still my favorite so far.

I have one complaint, which doesn't take away from this production, except for those of us with white whiskers. It is sung
in English. Boooooo.

Beverly Sills tried this with ""La Fille du Regiment""..and that too, I hardly caught a single word that was intelligeable. It just does NOT work! To understand this, you sort of have to be that age where the eyesight is not so great, nor the hearing - all of us lose the upper range. Once you arrive at this sorry state, you will obsrve that NO ONE speaks the King's English well!..especially young people who are talking faster and faster and faster with each passing year. Today, any youth could ba an auctioneer...it wouldn't matter if youdidn't understand them...all except for ""going, going...sold""

Those of us who sing, know that when we sing in Italian, the best language for singing, period...each and every vowel has a strictly precise shaping of the mouth lips and tongue. There is some variance re.  intonation,,resonating farther back in the
mouth and throat, and sometimes forward...all achieved by precision movements and shaping - round for ""O""...wide open for ""A"", almost a grimace for ""i"" or ""ee""; lips protruding for ""U"" ""oo"".Italian voice coaches have been known to train young singers for months , working on just the vowels..and then gradually teaching to just touch on a consonant, but touch on it with great clarity! You will know a ""T"" from a ""D"", or a ""P"" froma ""B"". You can observe this now ~ that you know...watch great Italian singers, and Spanish ones, of course, Domingo,Jose BRos, Carreras, Caballe, Maria Bayo, etc.,  and you will clearly see the mouth shapes I describe above.

Then observe in the ""features"" track of this DVD, the interview with the producer and actor kenneth Branagh..watch carefully as he speaks through a narrow slit of lips..bringing the lips together only if he absolutely HAS to...this is how all young people today speak...doing virtually all the pronouncing in the very back of the throat, with barely moving lips.

In a word?...""Gargling words""...gargling! The lips are there for a reason, people!

And singing coloratura embellishments and roccoco curly cues, a dozen notes or more on one freaking syllable...and do you think that is understood? it is impossible to understand!..So..my friends with white whiskers...you are forewarned...you absolutely must know the story very well to know what the hell is going on with this production."
782,5.0,"I freaking love this movie...

The music is moving, the story line is cute, I am *spolier alert* glad August found his family... I kind of wish I was able to see them living that happily ever after, but I can see it in my head, lol.

I am in love with the music and am now looking for the soundtrack..."
783,5.0,"Oh my gosh this is a freaking good movie that truly builds on itself! I could not have predicted many a things in it. Watch it and sit back and reflect on it. You don't see movies like this everyday. If your used to traditional movies you might not enjoy it but in my opinion, this movie is how most movies should be. Original and unique."
784,3.0,"Let me start out by saying I am a huge fan of both Cormac McCarthy and the Coens, however as a would-be crime writer myself I have to admit I became pretty annoyed with NCFOM the last time I watched it. There are several bizarre plot developments that make no sense at all in the real world. These serve to really sap the believability of the story and take away from the overall experience.

Primary among these is the decision by Brolin's character (Lewellyn Moss) to return to the scene of the drug deal shoot-out. This really requires a huge leap of faith from the viewers. Seriously, what person in their right minds, having walked away CLEAN with $2m, would return to the scene to give someone a drink of water? This is just pure freaking craziness. That was a HUGE problem for me. If the guy had dropped something that could ID him and had to return to retrieve it, I would have been much happier. That would make sense! But to just go back for no reason other than to give a really bad guy and a total stranger, who by then is most likely DEAD, a drink of water is a huge mountain to climb. Moss strikes me as a supremely practical kind of guy. Everything he does up to that point is thought through carefully with one aim - to preserve his own hide. So why in hell would he get out of bed in the middle of the night and do something that dumb? In the REAL world he would have been on his way to Vegas with that $2m to party it up with his ill-gotten gains and there is NO WAY he would have gone back there.

Secondly, the scene when Tom Bell and the deputy visit the trailer park and discover that Chigurh was just there before them. The Deputy exclaims, 'Oh Sheriff, let me call it in!"" and Bell responds, ""what are you going to tell them? That we are looking for someone who has recently drunk milk?"" And then proceeds to drink from the glass. I just about heaved something through the television at that point. No law enforcement officer in the WORLD would pass up the chance to run that glass for prints and DNA. How does he know at that point that they don't have that guy in the system? Any idiot who watches the Crime channel etc knows that DNA is the number one most effective method for catching bad guys. Even a miniscule amount is enough. When you have someone's mouth just having slobbered all over a glass, that's like a freaking WEALTH of DNA evidence. Even if the guy isn't in the system (quite likely since he's a pro and probably an import) at the very LEAST it might help somewhere down the line in the course of the investigation. So, major faux pas number two!

There are several other little details that are glossed over. Like how does Chigurh access his handler's (Stephen Root) office, when there is no access to that floor from the street elevator, as pointed out by Woody Harrelson's character in an earlier scene? How is Moss too dumb to think of transferring the money to another case until its almost too late? And last but not least, it simply ain't possible to silence a shotgun so that you can repeatedly fire silenced rounds through it. Yes, we are used to seeing Hollywood take huge liberties with firearm reality, but seriously, if you have any concept of how a shotgun works, you'd know that's not possible. You can build a temporary silencer for one, but after one shot you'd have to replace it, because it would be blown to s*** by the pellets and or slug.

Other than that, this movie is near perfect, but the above bits of BS are major issues for me, and they have definitely coloured my enjoyment of this film."
785,2.0,"couldnt get past the girls freaking out in typical girl fashion, pisses me off. the commercials really captured the best parts TT.TT"
786,2.0,"Emile Hirsch, what happened to you?  You're playing a douchy wannabe software entrepreneur whose best lines involve flirting with a flight attendant over airplane-cell phone propaganda.  We're only a few minutes into this movie and I already finding myself disliking your protagonist.  I've seen you quiet and soulful in Into the Wild (2007), humorously innocent in the amazing The Girl Next Door (2004), credibly authoritative in Alpha Dog (2006)...and now this?  Did you lose a bet or just piss off one too many directors with vegan, gluten-free, organic catering demands?  Simply accepting this role and this script was a failure before the cameras even started rolling.  We'll call this strike one.

Anyway, this software designer and his partner are on a business trip to Moscow to market a social networking app for navigating the club circuit in any major city in the world.  [Why did they need to go to Moscow for this?  Because it was cheaper to film the movie there.]  Hirsch plays the more laid back, carefree partner who is always telling his business-oriented friend to relax.  Not even ten minutes into this flick they are double-crossed by a third party and ousted out of their own deal.  This really deviates from the standard formula.  The Hostel series, The Chernobyl Diaries, Wrong Turn, Wolf Creek and The Cabin in the Woods rely more simply on a group of friends going on a vacation.  It's simple but it works.  You never find yourself saying ""what's the point in them being in Moscow for this business deal"" and the movie's credibility is maintained until the real fun starts when the players begin to drop one by one to whatever the random malevolent force the writers dreamed up.  That's strike two.

So our boys go out clubbing to drink away their failed business venture and meet up with two cuties.  They seem to get along when suddenly there's a world-scale power outage and countless energy-based life forms fall from the sky like snow-flaky embers aglow with Tinkerbell's fairy dust.  They start incinerating people like vampires to Blade's silver katana, people start running and screaming, and we're only fifteen minutes into the movie.  Well, at least we didn't have to suffer through the business deal plot any more.

As people scream and turn into aerosol compost our heroes, now numbering five with the addition of the shark who screwed them over on their app idea,  hide in a restaurant store room. A week after the invisible, incinerating invasion began, they emerge to go to the US Embassy...because they wouldn't have been charred, right?  Oh, and the slick douchebag has turned into an annoying high strung coward.  Those characters are so annoying and they never get killed off as fast as you'd like.

The streets of Moscow have turned into an I Am Legend, soulless dust bowl of abandoned cars and ghostly edifices.  Hirsch leads the way as they remain ever vigilant.  Because these energy-based aliens activate electronic devices (i.e., lights) when they are present, our heroes learn to travel when it's safest: night.

At one point Hirsch avoids detection by standing perfectly still as the creature just strolled by unaware on the other side of a window.  Considering that these things see lifeforms like glowing fireballs of infrared, making them extremely obvious, I think that moment of idiocy makes for strike three.  They can't see through glass or metal cages?  Whatever!  Now I have to watch these idiots walking around like glass shield-bearing knights.  Just stupid!
Along the way their group grows by two, one of which is an annoying Russian girl with such memorable lines as ""It's okay, I'm tough"" and ""I am not a kid!""  Barf!  I hope she dies next.  But luckily the other addition, a wacked out electrician, invented a Ghostbusters microwave gun to combat our electric invaders.

I guess the effects were tolerable.  But how many times can you entertain me with people getting jerked into the air for a second and then getting turned to spiraling cinders by some invisible dust devil alien?  They shatter glass and detonate doors--boring.  After they disintegrated the first few people and a dog the kills got boring.  Our heroes start freaking out every time a breeze kicks up some debris and then the ""dumb"" really hits the fan.  They meet dumber tough-talking characters who fight the aliens in dumb ways wearing dumb outfits amid ridiculously dumb scenarios and give dumb speeches about preserving every human life they can.  Just truckloads and truckloads of dumb!  Oh, and eventually you get to see these aliens and, you guessed it, they look dumb!  The worst effects in the movie were dedicated to showing us what the aliens truly look like without their invisibility shield--they look like some weird floating head monster from Doom.  It's most upsettingly dumb when Hirsch kills an alien by throwing a charred piece of another dead alien at it.  One throw?  Really?  Climax-fail!  Sorry, we're out of strikes.

In the end I wished everyone died.  The quality of this movie actually decreased as the running time wore on and, accordingly, I turned on the characters more and more with every passing scene.  I won't say skip this movie.  But if you choose to watch it, watch and mock it with friends."
787,1.0,"Intelligent film viewers beware:

Apparently, Ben Mezrich's fantastic, non-fictional account of beating the house -- for real -- in the mid-nineties was not good enough for the makers of this film.

For some incomprehensible reason, they took a fascinating real-life story, glammed it up, time-shifted it to the present day, packed it full of tired cliches and overused plot devices, and baked up what we have here -- a totally unbelievable, totally silly exercise in film frustration.

Even good actors cannot save a terrible script.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!?  This could have been so smart, so good, just like the freaking book...

And by the way, the classroom exercise early in the film about a gameshow host and opening the doors makes absolutely no sense to me or my wife.  Knowing what's behind the third door does not help you decide which of the two remaining doors is preferred.  After door three is opened, the original choice of door number one becomes no more or less likely to win than door number two.

GET THE BOOK, it's great and might make you smarter.  This movie will just make you dumber."

There is a difference, believe me. Anyway, this movie provided me with a fair amount of everything I wanted at the moment. There is a background story that is introduced in beginning and provides adequate reasoning for where they ended up. I found myself showing sympathy for these main characters in the film and that was unusual as well as nice for me. Usually in Saws and Hostels, you do not care about who dies, but with this I felt they did a great character development. There are plenty of high tension scenes that provide you with usually a bloody ending;) There is a particularly squirmish scene where two of the guys are crawling through a hole in the movie that was more bothersome than watching the descent. AHH!! It made me wanna stretch out my arms and roll around to be thankful I was not caught in a freaking hole. The ending (climax) of the film was enjoyable as well and this is important because a movie can make or break it from an ending. Overall for a horror movie that was not a remake and even was part of the affter dark horrorfest movies, I'd say bravo and a job well done to director Xavier Gens of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hitman-Digital-Copy-Blu-ray/dp/B0012U9IPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hitman (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray</a>] I will not be getting rid of this film, It was better than Hostel 1 and 2 IMHO.

789,3.0,"The film starts off where Futurama: Bender's Big Score left off, the universe has a giant rip and people are freaking out. The Professor (Billy West), Hermes (Phil LaMarr), Leela (Katey Sagal), Bender (John DiMaggio), Amy (Lauren Tom) and Zoigberg (Billy West) are trying to figure out what to do about the space anomaly. During the meeting, Fry (Billy West) introduces the Planet Express crew to Colleen (Brittany Murphy), his new girlfriend.

Amy and Kip announce they are holding a Fonfon Ru ceremony (joining of families ceremony). The Planet Express crew join the ceremony and ""The Grand Priestess"" performs the ceremony in Kip's home world in the swamp. She also has five other jobs, also grand and she lives there. Colleen catches the bouquet that Kip throws, which makes Fry and Colleen believe it is meant to be with one another.

Later, Professor Farnsworth and Professor Wernstrom (David Herman) are unable to agree on who is going to lead the expedition into space at the University and have the Planet Express crew battle it out in a game of ""Deathball"" against grad students eager for a letter of recommendation. After the game of Deathball, Fry finds out that Colleen has a boyfriend on the opposing team as well as three other boyfriends. Fry decides not to go on the expedition to investigate the space anomaly and to move in with Colleen. Fry unable to deal with not being treated equal in a five-way relationship decides to immediately break up with Colleen. This leads to a big theme of the film with Yivo (David Cross) - a lonely planet with a billion tentacles and one eye.

Bender goes to the space anomaly with the rest of the Planet Express crew to investigate the space anomaly, but due to the fact that he is not human and the electro-magnetic field factor, he blasts the crew back to earth.  Fry frustrated with his love life decides he needs to get far away and hides in the bottom of Zapp Brannigan's ship. Fry later escaping from the lint compartment takes his spacesuit up to the anomaly and says goodbye to everything he knew and cared about and goes through the anomaly where he meets Yivo. Fry desperate for love and Yivo wanting to be cared for, come together.

The tentacles begin to break through the space anomaly and eventually reach earth. Fry as Yivo's host speaks to New New York and tells everyone that he loves the tentacle and they need to love it too. Eventually, Fry becomes the pope, has the rest of the world invaded and everyone with the exception of Leela are invaded by the tentacle. The rest of the film explores on Yivo's need for love and wanting to be in a serious relationship with everyone.

I found this film less exciting than Futurama: Bender's Big Score for several reasons, the film has three different ""feels"" to it: 1/3 feels like a film, 1/3 feels like the TV series, 1/3 feels like and episode of ""Tales of Interest"". I felt the section with Bender and the League of Robots was just used as filler to make the film longer and to have a purpose near the end of the film. There is a lot of American humour throughout the film, but none of it was good and are all one-liners. The only decent humour in the film was more European humour and by that I mean, fans of the series that will see things from the original series and laugh at the guest appearances by certain characters that appear in the film. Some of the other humour comes from Bender, knowing his personality and how he reacts in certain situations. Whilst Futurama: The Beast with A Billion Backs was not a horrid film, it was very average and to a good degree, the ending was almost predictable as well as partly using an event that happened in the TV series.
3/5

Picture:
The film is presented in the 1.78:1 (16:9) format. The picture was crystal clear throughout the film. There were only one or two times when some of the cells seemed a bit blurry, but it is nothing that is noticeable or would deter you from watching the film
4.5/5

Sound:
The film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Unlike Futurama: Bender's Big Score, this film actually takes advantage of all five speakers. Whilst I would have appreciated a few more sounds coming from the rear left and rear right speakers, as it would have given a more cinematic feel, I found that during action sequences the music really made use of all five speakers. The voice actors voices were always clearly audible in the centre speaker during the talking scenes, which for some films can sometimes be problematic.
4.5/5

Special Features:

The DVD includes: Commentary from the producers and cast, Futurama: The Lost Adventure (A Full-Length feature adventure produced for the video game), Storyboard Animatic, Deleted Scenes, David Cross Featurette, Blooperama, 3D Models with Animator Discussion, A Brief History of Deathball and Bender's Game Trailer.

Final Thoughts:

Futurama: The Beast with A Billion Backs was entertaining enough. However, I can honestly see this as three episodes of Futurama if the script was changed slightly. Fry and Colleen's relationship could have been an episode, Bender and the League of Robots its own episode and lastly Yivo and Earth could have been another single episode. There are many video game jokes in this film which are funny if you are a gamer and it was in Futurama taste. Overall, I would say if you are a Futurama fan you will want to see this  because of the guest appearances from characters from the show, but if you are a casual Futurama watcher I would just say rent it. Last thing I will say is, I watched the trailer for ""Futurama: Bender's Game"" and it looks like rubbish. It looks like a hour and a half version of ""Tales of Interest"" that is Dungeon's and Dragons themed. Yet, you never know it could be good, but I will post a review of that when it is released."
790,4.0,"I used to watch this show when it came out on TV in the late 90s and I loved it. Well, I was also a kid back then and easily impressed I guess. I mean wow was I enamored by Tony Crane who captured Remy McSwain's arrogant and sexy swagger so deliciously.  I also loved the sexual tension between him and Ann Osbourne and the steamy, sexy New Orleans scene and shots of the French Quarter and surrounding neighborhoods. The movie just had a certain charm to it.

Anyway, now, looking at the show I must say it is pretty bad. I love the music, the setting and the sexy vibe of it all, but story and acting wise it leaves much to be desired. It is just not very sophisticated. Remy McSwain (Tony Crane) is your typical film-noir detective. His character is pretty one dimensional and he acts more like he was a private eye than a cop. He is a caricature of your typical loner detective who has a problem with authority really and who roams the steamy city with driving a metallic blue Corvette with the top down while wearing white linen suits with yellow silk shirts and a gold ring. He really doesnt have much of a personality beyond that. I seriously doubt any cop could walk around and behave like that - not even in NO; then again, this is one of the charming things about the show - although it would have been nice to have a multidimensional character.

Ann Osbourne (Susan Walters) who's supposed to be the assistant DA is not very believable in that role, mainly because she spends most of her time chasing people around while playing detective with Remy and throwing in the occasional legal jargon to create tension between her and Remy.

The series is filled with clichees like that. For example, the chief of police walks around with a cigar in his mouth all day making snide remarks (you wonder how he became chief, he never seems to do any work).  The cranky female assistant is a bit quirky and is always ready to deliver some smart remark to antagonize the lead and of course there is  the lead's side-kick and buddy who is willing to break the rules on his behalf because he aint a cop like Remy.

So yes the story lines are unbelievable and the characters full formula, but I go in there understanding and accepting this as a premise and enjoy it.

I also don't care it supposedly wasn't a 100% accurate depiction of New Orleans or if the Cajun accent wasn't copied meticulously. This isn't supposed to be a freaking documentary but a lightweight cop show placed in New Orleans. If you want something more authentic, with the same story lines evolving around either sexual abuse, rape or passionate murders because of sexual abuse and rape, go watch Law Order or CSI. This show is mid/late 90s, kitch; it is goofy and colorful with a great soundtrack. Has sort of an innocence and simplicity to it that you cannot find in any of the TV shows of today that mostly seem to be about some kind of government or alien conspiracy with a political undertone. This show is easy entertainment and  Tony Crane is just dope."
791,5.0,"Sam Tyler is still stuck in 1973, unsure if he has somehow really travelled backwards in time or if he is merely stuck in a coma in 2006 and is fantasising everything that is happening to him. However, now he has been there for a few weeks he is getting more used to life in the 1970s and is starting to downplay the unusual auditory and visual hallucinations he continues to suffer from. But, just as things seem to be settling down, questions about Sam's previous 1970s life in 'Hyde' before relocating to Manchester arise, and set in chain a sequence of events which could lead Sam home...wherever that is.

Life on Mars' second season was the last, due to a combination of the producers not wishing to over-exploit the concept and lead actor John Simm's well-known reluctance to be typecast in a long-running television series. It was a bold decision for a series that had become a big hit on British television and done the seemingly impossible by getting audiences fired up over a cop show.

The second season offers up pretty much more of the same as the first season: Sam and Gene butt heads over their different approaches to policing, but they have, grudgingly, accepted that each has skills the other does not, and when they combine their approaches it often leads to good results. Sam and Annie continue to not quite get it together in the tradition of all great TV will-they, won't-they romances, and Sam continues to be haunted by hallucinations of his life in 2006 which relate to his current situation in 1973. The show also moves onto slightly more contentious ground in Season 2 by covering the more controversial subject of IRA terrorism in one episode whilst continuing to examine the extent of corruption and heavy-handed methods in the 1970s police force.

In my review of Season 1, I mentioned that the show's continuous use of Sam's odd mental state occasionally gets a little exasperating, as sometimes you'd quite like to just see Sam and Gene butt heads and then solve the crime without Sam freaking out every twenty minutes. The producers play on this in two episodes in particular in the second season, one in which Sam doesn't have any odd experiences and starts getting worried about the lack of them, and another in which Sam reacts very badly to whatever is happening to him in the present and has to sit most of the investigation out. This latter episode, which is by far the most 'freak-out' intensive of the series, also perversely is one of the very best episodes, with flashbacks showing how they operated before he arrived (and giving rise to the unusual sight of scenes not featuring Sam, which feels odd as he is in every other single scene of every other episode of the whole series).

Of course, as good as the individual episodes are (and they are pretty damn good), the one episode that everyone will be left talking about is the very last one. British SF is awash with series-ending episodes that leave the audience reeling and talking about them for years or decades afterwards: Blake's 7, Sapphire and Steel and The Prisoner being the most notable (Quantum Leap's befuddling finale is probably the USA's closest equivalent). Life on Mars joins their august ranks with a finale that takes the viewer on a crazy existential rollercoaster ride as we finally get an answer for what is going on with Sam, but that answer is in turn supplanted by another, contradictory one in a manner that would make Christopher Priest proud. Which is the truth and which do we believe? The finale operates on multiple levels of reality with the viewer not quite able to trust what is going on. There is a very clear 'obvious' possible answer for what is going on, but just as with David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, that 'obvious' answer still leaves other, key questions unanswered.

Taken in isolation, Life on Mars' finale is very strong indeed. However, the news that a sequel/spin-off series was forthcoming which would shed more light on events did dilute the strength of that finale a bit, and Ashes to Ashes' plot developments have indeed plunged much of what we thought we knew from Life on Mars' finale into doubt. But further examination of that series is for another review.

The second season of Life on Mars (****) is thoroughly entertaining, funny, thought-provoking and just the right side of ambiguous. It draws a line under the series and sets up the sequel series quite nicely. It is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and will be released in the USA on DVD in November."
792,5.0,One of his best movies and suprised it didn't get more favorable reviews. Many scenes that you will never forget such as licking white dog poop or freaking out about not being able to watch shark week.
793,5.0,This movie is freaking awesome. Everyone that I know that's seen it couldn't stop laughing the ENTIRE movie. It is seriously one of the top 5 funniest movies of all time.
794,4.0,"OK, the Ultimate Collection is pretty darn good and WWE wants to suck old time fans like me out of some more cash so they're going through with this ""Definitive Collection"".

The first thing we need to say here is that I am hoping for a comprehensive documentary on Flair and his career and life.  We got a darn good one on the Four Horsemen DVD but on the Ultimate Collection, Flair just talks and introduces matches and angles and then they show them.  Sure, he gives us a little insight on the motivation at the time but a guy like The Nature Boy needs the full documentary treatment like Dusty, HBK, and Bret have had on their DVD collections.  Plus, they need to do this or it isn't going to sell as well as the Ultimate Collection did because a lot of fans are going to hate the inevitable overlapping of matches between the two DVD sets.

They need to have the 1993 Starrcade career vs. WCW title match with Vader on this new set.  That to me was the most glaring omission from the Ultimate Collection.

Also, bet your bottom dollar that the run-up to this past Wrestlemania and emotional final match with HBK will be on the new set because Vince knows we are all going to go out and buy the WM24 DVD for Flair's HOF stuff and the final match and then he can soak us again a few months later for the Definitive Collection.  Why, because Ric Flair is the freaking man.

This movie has just the right amount of humor and action to entertain adults while not freaking out the younger kids.

800,3.0,"Let's just get this over with.  If you like meaningless films where goofiness reigns supreme, JUMPER is your nirvana.  A young man named David (a bewildered-looking Hayden Christensen) discovers he has the ability to ""jump"" (teleport) from one location to another--anywhere in the world.  So what does he do?  Um, rob banks to set up a cushy lifestyle so he can pick up chicks by night in London and have lunch on top of the Great Sphinx of Egypt.

Heaven forbid young David would do anything constructive with such an extraordinary gift. . .

But wait.  There's more.  David discovers he's not alone; there are other jumpers out there (and they're all young adults; go figure).  And these jumpers are being pursued by paladins--sanctimonious Bible thumpers devoted to kill all jumpers because (we suppose, as we're never really given an explanation) they are ""evil.""  The paladins are led by a white-haired, very devout Samuel L. Jackson.  So, bewildered-looking David teams up with a fellow jumper (Jamie Bell, who is a not-so-nice jumper) to battle Jackson and the paladins--and that's when the goofiness takes over to the point poor girlfriend's (Rachel Bilson) apartment is totally trashed.

Oh, and the electric ""ropes"" the paladins use to trap the jumpers so reminded me of plumbing snakes.  Just an observation.

And the gorgeous Diane Lane is totally and utterly wasted in her brief appearances.  Yet I give this stinker three stars because director Doug Liman furnishes eye-opening vistas, visuals, and special effects to demonstrate at least someone brought some imagination to the set.  Yet JUMPER doesn't show that teleporting is unique.  Heck, my doctor, lawyer, and accountant do it every time I really need them.

At first I thought this was going to be another one of those movies like paranormal inactivity but boy was I ever so wrong. I wanted to reach into my TV screen and yank the victims out before they were doomed. I had nightmares for two straight nights because of this movie.

Little girl- stop staring at me from behind the door.

Definitely a worthy Shaw brothers film, and I advise you to go seek this mutha out!!!"
804,2.0,"I'm wondering when it became a federal crime to have a PLOT in a movie anymore. The writers of ""Desperate Measures"" apparently thought an interesting and coherent storyline would get them a seat in the death house because they avoided anything even remotely connected to reality in this movie.

First, there's the eminently annoying Andy Garcia. His usual tics are in full bloom - this guy has more twitches than Clint Eastwood on speed. His son needs a bone marrow transplant, and the only human being on the entire earth who is a match is psycho killer Michael Keaton.

The movie is about how Garcia tries to keep the nutcase alive after he torches the hospital personnel and shoots all the cops in his escape attempt. The boy who plays the son is adorable; one of the few kids who actually ACTS like a kid. And Michael Keaton really has a knack for psycho parts (although I still miss his ""Batman"" hero performances.) Both Keaton and the kid are the only reason it even merits two stars.

But it's the idea that no matter what this guy does, who he kills, he MUST live so Garcia's kid can get a transplant. After one of the many slaughter scenes in the movie, the police captain says to Garcia, ""How many cops have to die so your son can live?""

Good freaking question!"
805,5.0,"I found myself saying that quite a bit throughout this movie, actually. As many of you no doubt know, I've taken it upon myself to watch all of the 'Man-Eater' films. If you don't know, these are a bunch of low budget horror films that debuted on Sci-Fi channel and feature various animals running amok and attacking people. You know, like grizzly bears, sharks, crocodiles, Bengal tigers, giant squid or, in this particular case, swarms of ants. Well, sort of. But I'll get to that in good time. And trust me, this one REALLY takes the cake!

My girlfriend picked this one up as a surprise gift, and we watched it the other night. All I can say is... what just happened? We found ourselves laughing through the entire movie, so some of my critiques might not be entirely accurate. Anyway, the movie is set in a 'generic SE Asian archipelago' (but incidentally filmed in Thailand) and possibly set in the future, as the high-tech exterminators in the film seem to wear space suits and shoot LASER BEAMS at the swarm of ants. Yes, you heard me correct, freaking LASER BEAMS! Much like the ants, however, these consist of cheesy, hastily done CGI artwork. But the ANTS really take the cake, not the least of which because they do stuff like... oh, form gigantic flying fists! Made entirely out of ants!

Mind you, I didn't go in expecting this to be all that scientific of a film, and (in fact) army ants do form 'living bridges' by joining up like that... sort of. But still, this film REALLY strained the limits of credibility here. Most of the actors weren't all that interesting, aside from the two chicks (neither of whom get eaten by ants, by the way, despite what the buxom babe on the cover may lead you to think) and the Asian dictator guy who pops up every now and then. But the crowning glory of this film is part way through when the ants form a LIVING COMPUTER (!) by generating electricity (!!) and conduct a hostage negotiation with the humans (?!?!). Oh, that and the fact that aliens were involved somehow (which we only find out in the last five minutes or so).

So, my opinions of this... abomination? Well, it was pretty funny. Surreal almost, in fact. Like I said, between the gigantic ant fists and the references to an (unseen) spaceship, I'm not entirely sure what to make of this one. Its VERY different from the other Man-Eater flicks like 'Man-Eater,' 'Croc,' 'Eye of the Beast,' and the recent 'Hybrid,' thats for sure. Much more sci-fi content. If you like baaad movie, you can't miss this one. It is the cheesiest thing I've seen in quite a long time."
806,1.0,"Yes, the Wild West was violent, but that's all there was to this piece of crap!  Never watched it when it first came out, and I'm so glad I didn't waste my time then, but 26 years later and all kinds of talk about it, thought I'd try it; plus I love Tommy Lee Jones!  I couldn't believe how much violence it had; it sickened me.  Was all this horrible stuff in the book?  I'm so glad I didn't read it; I made it to about episode 3 and just couldn't take anymore; it never lightened up or got any better.  I loved the character of Gus and liked Call even though he wasn't very nice or patient at all. I can't believe that Jake knew these 2 guys or was supposedly like them; he was a selfish bas****  in every possible way.  Too much time was spent on Blue duck and his psycho-ness; why didn't Gus just kill him outright rather than knowing what a piece of crap he was, let him just walk away when seeing him again? Was watching this with my Scottish husband who wasn't raised with all the glory of the ""taming of the west"" stuff handed to us in school.  This freaking show wasn't very damn glorified to me; am totally turned off the author and don't know whether to give him a try or not.  As far as I'm concerned besides the big heart of Gus, this was a POS that I wouldn't recommend to anyone! What a complete waste of time and film. Blah!"
807,1.0,"This was by far the dumbest movie I have ever seen. If I could reward zero stars to this movie, I would!

The characters and scenarios make no freaking sense. Like if a city is destitute and people become cannibals, why on earth are there cows in the city? And where on earth do these people find the water to dye their hair if they're super dirty and struggling? And how can a person on motorcyle not catch up to a person on a straight path running on foot a few blocks in front of them?

Don't waster your time on this movie. No amount of drugs could get a me high enough to claim this movie enjoyable."
808,2.0,"I'm addicted. I've been binge watching this as part of my research for a new series we're writing, and it's almost like a drug. If you love westerns and frontier/ pioneer life, then this is the show for you!

Amendment: I have tho drop this review WAY down. Everything seemed fine until the third season. Disc eight - Dr. Mike's wedding - had absolutely NO SOUND! Seriously?! That's, like, the most important event in the freaking show. I am VERY disappointed with whoever manufactured these discs. I could've dealt with the fact that some of them sound louder than others, or even the occasional static look the picture would get. But no sound to watch Michaela and Sully marry? What a bunch of hog wash!"
809,5.0,"I loved this movie.... it's one of my favorites for some reason. Rad mythology. I love the Wachoski sisters... I just love pretty much everything they do. Much like M Night Shaleman, their characters have so much heart..they are just lovable, good, characters, sort of like if the world could be full of the people you would want it to be... bad guys, sure. But the good guys are really good guys. I can tell they're both INFPs, ha. The story is pretty freaking genius too. I really think critics panned it because their just all jealous. They don't create anything. They just make a living criticizing what other people dream, what other people create, and actually DO. I mean, how lame would it be to be a critic for a living, seriously? I would die in shame. Although I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie, Trump is President. So I'm sure if you're a Trump fan, you might not like it. Might have too much heart, and maybe soul.."
810,1.0,"If you saw this movie (like I stupidly did) you probably walked out of the theater licking your wounds. Not just because your a Transformers fan and you had to watch Michal Bay take a crap all over something important to you but also because you probably felt like you just paid someone $12.50 (or however much movies cost in your hometown) to kick you in the face for the longest 2 and a half hours of your life.

Revenge of the Fallen is an abrasive, ugly, racist, offensive, awful excuse for a movie. It's a giant advertisement for god knows what that's full of explosions and the sound of clanging metal.
Questions will arise as your brain wonders what it did to piss you off and your eyeballs try to kill themselves. Questions like, What purpose did the ""twins"" have other then to remind us that racism still exsist?! why did we need to see Devastator's balls? Why is John Tuttoro in a thong?!
Megan Fox and Shila Booff or whatever the hell his name is have the chemistry and acting abilities of wet towels! Why in the name of freaking GOD would I wanna see a greater focus on them?!
OH! and speaking of god... ROBOT HEAVEN!!!! NUFF' SAID!!!!
I know it seems like I'm dropping some serious spoiler and I am. BUT I DON'T CARE! The movie has all but ZERO plot!
If you haven't seen this movie yet and are concidering it don't! Instead stay at home and stick forks in both of your ears while playing with power tools and suckng on a car battery. It will be more enjoyable and slightly less painful then the ass kicking you will get from your friends and family when you admit this movie lives in your collection!

Phenomenal special effects great script, ""again to those who dissed the dialogue"" that is how people really speak so get a clue.

812,1.0,"Yeah you got the parts all transformers fans want more action, more explosions, more autobots, and more decepticons.

Like a good reviewer best put it ""Michael Bay got paid 75 million dollars to lose his freaking mind"" cause that is exactly what he displayed here. While the actions are awesome and beautifully done it does not even redeem the sheer stupidity of the story line that only fans and kid fans of the series can enjoy. I have seen the film and 3 of my other (Super transformers fans)friends have seen it and while sadly one of my friend loved it because he even admitted that since he is a fan of the franchise he is biased. Well anyway my other 2 friends and i agreed with this fact while action wise it surpasses the original story wise it was far worse than the first could ever be and it was far longer than it needed to be 150 mins WHAT THE HELL. Bay had the nerve to insult the smarter viewers by thinking that everyone will be glad with just explosions and destructions that we won't care if a story is not present he probably thought we would be ""Duuuh autobot went boom yhaaaaay"" he even made a statment saying that we should ""Take the film for what it is"" well i did it's crap. the acting here was bad and i blame bay for lack of direction for them. Many fans who read this will be mad and say that i don't know what i'm talking about and my response will be ""thank you for proving that you are in denial and biased that you do not want to admit that you threw $10. down the toilet."" in closing if you are a fan who can be unbiased and have seen enough movies to tell what is actually a good film then we can agree this film sucks."
813,5.0,"i see some of the crappiest shows on dvd but daria ISN'T on dvd yet?
it blows my mind.
daria is a fantastic show, one of the few that acctually makes me laugh hardcore.

please put it on dvd. the show is great and deserves it. beavis and butthead even got a freaking dvd release! (not gonna lie, i own it) but daria is 10X better than beavis and butthead."
814,1.0,"I know this is a LOW budget film that went straight to video so my expectations were not high going into this movie. Turns out I was giving the movie far too much credit. This has got to be one of the dumbest, silliest, poorly acted movies I have ever seen. It really is one of those movies where it is SO BAD it is funny (and obviously not intending to be). The story was ludicrous. Just some of the absurdities, I love how they always seem to be walking/running around in one large pack, both the Americans and Germans, etc. guess they felt the need for every actor to always be in the shot. When GI's are walking behind enemy lines at night it's always proper to scream out other soldiers names to get their attention or better yet, not to be the least bit concerned about chain smoking cigarettes. Guess the Germans all suffered night blindness and can't see the glowing cigarettes. And then there are the Germans, who needs guards when you're transporting a train full of prisoners, they won't escape the door locks will hold'em!!!!! Or the German Commander, knowing the Americans they are chasing are hiding on the train, just poo pooing it by saying, oh we'll get them when they get to Stuttgart (300 miles away). What, they can't stop the train? Too freaking funny!!! Or better yet, one American with a Tommy Gun never misses hitting every Germans when shooting at them (of course Germans make sure they all run directly into the line of fire so they can be mowed down like the cannon fodder they are) but when you have dozens of Germans shooting back at they can't hit a broadside of a barn (or train for that matter).  For comedy it's good the Germans drive around in trucks with gigantic swastikas on the doors, just to remind us that they are bad. Or better still, a brand new replacement can pick up a sniper rifle, shoot a German sniper and suddenly everyone thinks he is hot stuff. Then when the Squad Sergeant is mortally wounded he decides that the hot stuff replacement private is the only person qualified to take his place and run the squad and not one other soldier bats an eye. And the funniest moments, all an American soldier has to do is put on a German Uniform (no matter how dirty and ill fitting) and every German they come across is totally convinced they are fellow German soldiers without ever muttering a single word in German (and better yet, have conversations in English as Germans walk past them remaining totally oblivious). Quality, simply quality!!! Now the actors, Tom Sizemore looks like he has spent the last 5 years or so at Golden Corral eating everything in sight. Jrgen Prochnow one of my favorites, he must be broke and needs money, why on earth would he ever do a film like this.  I could go on and on with other ridiculous parts of this movie (including the detonated nuclear bomb, oh brother!!!) but I'd then end up writing a novel.

You don't need a big budget to make a good movie, just a good script, competent Director and decent actors. This awful movie has none of that."
815,5.0,Its freaking awesome!! Gosh the movie sucked something awful! The show was enjoyable for me and my wife and for any actual kid that watches it. It can childish at times...but its awesome!
816,2.0,"basically, think ""MASH""..... but in Iraq, and infantry, instead of medical. And like MASH, there is a pervasive cynicism that is bad enough that it actually annoyed me. Marines tend to talk a lot of smack, and complain, but this was more like a diatribe of misery.

The GOOD: The characters are great. For example, the SgtMaj was freaking hilarious! Everyone in the service knows someone like this...who is so tight and squared away that he becomes a character. by the end of the first 2 episodes, you pretty much like the group.  The pacing is good, and the banter is also really funny. It also shows some of the real politics in command structures. You really feel for the LT by the end of the series...

The BAD: well....let's just say that every episode revolves around groups of ""war crimes"" and abject incompetence by marines. That's total BS. Every scene has a marine smoking some innocent kid, or calling in an airstrike on a church. Yeh....like that is accurate...lol.  The other thing was the constant bitching by the characters. Marines are known to bitch, but they don't go around constantly doubting their country and it's mission. If it was all this bad, Marines would be working a different job. But that is what soured it for me. Most marines are pros, and they do a worthwhile mission. In the end they gave them the M*A*S*H treatment and sh! t-canned the series. You rarely see any camaraderie in ANY of the scenes. It's not the military I know...

Overall, it's not really going to make people in the service fans of the series. They should learn a little from American Sniper and show some of the brave things we do....."
817,5.0,"I freaking loved this movie! It's funny, fast-paced, the characters come alive instantly, the plot is great, the actors were phenomenal, and OMG Leonard Nimoy is in it too! YAY! LOVE LOVE LOVE. BUY BUY BUY!!! XD"
818,1.0,"I am going to spare everyone a summary of the plot and cut to the chase: while this movie was entertaining with a handsome cast and flashy scenes, it was not Star Trek.. If you had named it, let's say ""Space Academy - the Early Years"" it would be pretty ok but naming it Star Trek is sort of like throwing a bucket of acrylic paint at the Mona Lisa and calling it art. If you don't know much about Star Trek and don't care too much about internal consistency in a movie in general, character development, plausibility or a plot for that matter, then this is the movie for you. As a matter of fact I believe that one of the reasons this movie has proven to be very popular among non-Star Trek fans is because it is not Star Trek!! It is a glossy reboot of the original with little substance beneath its action-packed surface and pretty faces, resembling more an MTV video. Here are some of the more serious issues with this movie:

+ All of the ""acting"" is 'over the top' and everyone is exaggerated, to the point of clownish buffonery. Kirk (or Chris Pine really) appears to have ADD or something and he is arrogant, cocky, erratic, tactless and obnoxious. I was so annoyed early on with him already that I actually enjoyed watching him being beaten up at the bar. A cutsey boy cadet who walks on a bridge and says, ""I'm in charge"". You have got to be kidding me. Not only that but an Admiral placing him as second in command of a ship? Wow.

+ Lightning fast cuts from one scene to another like an MTV video and really poor plot where all the Enterprise crew just happen to find themselves together even though their entire respective pasts have been inexorably changed? Ridiculous.

+ The back stories behind how the original characters met was insulting and every tagline from the original series was used most inappropriately, as if they had a list of lines required to be used so that they could show at least some resemblance to the original show. Instead of spending time on developing each character, such as Spock's inner struggle and Kirk fighting his demons and finally turning from a repeat offender to a serious and devoted Starfleet officer, they forwarded (literally) all that to focus more on CGI effects and visuals.

+ Speaking of visuals: The interior of the Enterprise looks like a Bloomingdale's make-up counter. How ridiculous and untrue to even an altered timeline was that? The interior of ships in the 24th century didn't look this chic.

+ The villain was uninspired and dumb. Seriously. I mean here you got this Romulan (who doesn't even remotely look Romulan by the way and has super strength) who saw his entire planet be destroyed by a ""galaxy threatening supernova"" (!). Then, he is flung 200 years into the past, with a tub of super future material and nothing to do. Now, what would you do in this situation? If it were me, I might, oh, I don't know, WARN MY CIVILIZATION. Given 200 years of lead time, an evacuation would not be all that difficult. OK, let's say I'm a little bit crazy. What might I do then? Nero says he wants to create a world in which Romulus exists without the Federation. What might be the best way of achieving this? I might, oh, I don't know, GO TO ROMULUS, give them all this fantastic future technology, and become emperor of a civilization 200 years in advance of everyone else out there. What does Nero actually do? He goes it alone. Because, you know, shut up, that's why. He then decides to obliterate _an entire planet_ based on said faulty intelligence and wait 25 freaking years for Spock to show up so he can exact revenge. He then also just so happens to maroon Spock on a planet that just so happens to have a Starfleet base on it where he can oh so conveniently run into the new Kirk and inform him that it just so happens that his and new Spock's destiny is to be friends at all costs apparently. How so very inconvenient. Yup, that's the villain. There is no passion, no substance, no character, apparently also no intelligence behind his person and motive other than what was written in the script for him to act like.

+ The product placement was so obvious. Way to promote an enlightened future in which all of human kinds' ills coming from money and economic deprivation have been eradicated - by having something like 20 millions worth of product placement in there.

+ Bones: The reason for why McCoy says he is called ""bones"" was totally pulled out of the writers' butts in this movie. The expression comes from civil war time doctors who had to use saws to amputate legs. The term ""bones"" (which Kirk called McCoy in The Original Series) comes from that. In this stupid movie McCoy says ""in a divorce my wife got everything and left me dry to my BONES"" and they use that to explain why Kirk calls him ""bones"". Ridiculous.

+ If this is a future in which money has been eradicated (and lawyers executed), how can McCoy _lose_ everything he has in a divorce and be left ""dry to his bones""?

+ The Star Trek series, especially Star Trek: The Next Generation, brought in top scientific minds to advise about what is and is not science and how they can take an idea and transform it such that, even though it is science-fiction, it is still scientifically consistent and coherent.  This movie spent a lot of time on special effects, flashy scenes and catchy one-liners but very little on rationalizing the science and incorporating it intelligently into the movie to create consistency. They dumbed the whole premise down to a grade school level and some of the things they are trying to pass as ""science"" would make the head of any Star Trek regular writer spin in disbelief. That's what happens though when you set out to deliver bread and circuses to the masses. Ships flying through Black Holes and coming out the other side intact? Enterprise escapes the black hole by blowing up the warp core inside of it? Ski diving onto a platform FROM SPACE? A mining ship annihilating an entire planet?

+ The writers seemed to be thinking  that simply because this is science fiction, any kind of implausible garbage they come up with goes. Sci-fi doesnt equal magic though and the one thing Star Trek didn't rely on was magic bullets to explain phenomena and anomalies etc. In this movie, the most absurd stuff goes down and we are to believe it makes sense because the genre is sci-fi and the writers say so? How stupid do they actually think people are?

+ This movie is not true to Star Trek in even a rudimentary way. It is not intelligent, or thought provoking. It is not about space exploration and asking the tough questions, there is no ttempt at science, philosophy. Nothing. This is Star Trek the way only a product of the over-stimulated times we live in could make it. Cheeky, sexy, and dumb.

+ Speaking of inconsistency: Spock's and Kirk's relationship in this movie is adversarial from the start and all they do is argue and fight and at some point Spock is juts about to strangle Kirk. Yet in the end, somehow out of the blue, they become good friends, because the old Spock says they were in another life. That is completely inconsistent with how the characters have behaved and been portrayed throughout the movie as you cannot just push the button and say ""hey, I am good friends with you now"". That is just bad writing folks. If you cant even get something like character consistency within a plot right, you are a lousy writer. How Orci and Kurtzman are still with a job and get to write the sequels is truly beyond me.

+ Kirk's  promotion: how does a cadet go from being suspended for cheating to becoming the captain of one of Starfleet's most prestigious spaceships less than a week later? Yes he saved Earth, but come on. That scene where he is decorated as the second coming of Zefram Cochrane, by the same man who just a few days ago held the hearing on his cheating ways, was ridiculous. A cadet getting full command of a flagship while his instructor, in whose class he cheated and was caught, gets to serve under him as second in command? Laughable...if I was Spock, Vulcan stoicism or not, I would have taken the matter to Starfleet command.

+ McCoy's character played by Karl Urban seemed too old and sophisticated to be a Starfleet cadet, especially among this group of immature rascals. He seemed to be the only adult amidst this circus where a child (Kirk) was getting to play captain or something. Even though Urban did a fantastic job playing McCoy, they should have cast him either next to a more mature cast of Kirks and Spocks or cast him as an admiral or something. He really was the only one who wasn't out of his mind.

+ More than 600 episodes from Star Trek: The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager are all rendered invalid, because a couple of writers, who I must mention  have never even written a Star Trek episode before, had so little creative talent that their best idea was Well, why don't we just change the whole time-line, then we don't have to worry about established details and accurate characterizations. I am sure it's a good way for the writers and producers to turn a fast buck but Star Trek is part of pop culture. The continuity so lovingly and painstakingly preserved by all the movies, TV series and novels subsequent to the The Original Series has been destroyed with this movie. You don't have to be a Trek geek to find that outrageous.

+ It is sad to know that the last time I, or anyone of us, will probably EVER see Leonard Nimoy do the Vulcan salute is in this nasty piece of tourist trinket!

Bottom line: Somehow it all felt very untrue to the essence of Star Trek. It was too Hollywood and glammy and very little story and depth. If you like bling and lots of mind-less action and nail-biting sequences and good looking, hollow characters having music-video length ""dialogs"" with each other while flashing their handsomeness in front of smooth, shiny surfaces and catchy shots,  then this is the movie for you. But if you expect substance, drama, depth, coherence and plausibility, then you are in the wrong place. They had a lot of potential with this one but they just missed it. Since they were going to make sequels, they should have spent more time truly developing the characters and their relationships with one another and just the beginnings of their journey rather than rushing through that part and getting into some mind-less, pointless, absurd plot involving an insane yet at the same time comical Frankenstein's Romulan monster. They just missed all that and it felt rushed. The creative angle was missing and you could literally see dollar signs hanging from every cgi shot. Open up a spot for Jackie Chan, 20 ninjas and Lindsey Lohan in the sequel and the abomination will be complete."
819,5.0,"This is not the Star Trek of my youth, and I was a big fan - yet this movie delivers the freaking goods in ways that the wussy-fied Star Trek of the nineties could only dream about (Deep Space Nine, Voyager).  In this film, we're no longer in conflict about sipping 'tainted' mushroom soup (see Voyager - no, don't see it), now the stakes are real, larger than life, and important in the journey of this young crew. The entire cast raises the bar on performances, interaction, good chemistry and comedic timing.  It's uncanny how much Zachary Quinto resembles Leonard Nimoy in the role of Spock, while still putting his own tweak to the character. Chris Pine IS Captain Kirk.
Dr. McCoy is lovable and comedic and played to a ""T ""by Karl Urban.

It is very rare - preciously rare - that a big-budget franchise employs first class effects, compelling sound, and 3 strong Acts all in the service of character-driven storytelling. ""Star Trek"" is that rarity. This is Star Trek as space opera, big and adventurous, and is only given proper justice by seeing it in hi-def!"
820,5.0,"It's not like you were worried it might be a substandard Blu-ray release with poor video or audio quality, not in a big-budget effects-heavy J.J. Abrams movie made recently.  They were planning the Blu-ray during filming, you know it.

The bonus stuff is pretty good too -- Abrams is always fun to watch behind the scenes because he looks like how we, the fans, would probably be on the set, occasionally so overwhelmed by how freaking cool it is to be there and how cool is everything going on, that the enthusiasm is infectious."
821,5.0,"I'm so glad to know the Greek's are going to inherit the earth.  They deserve what's left when the rest of us use it up.

That's a joke, by the way.  I like Greeks just as much as anyone else.  At least I like their food.  And the women.  OK, I have no freaking idea what I'm talking about."
822,5.0,This VOLTRON series was the best after the LIONS series!!! It got more sci-fi feeling to it & it was very entertaining watching!!!! About freaking time this series is getting release on dvd!!
823,5.0,"I can't tell you how excited I was a year ago when [...] broke the news that WB was considering a Silverhawks release. Now, a year later, it's in my hands. And it is beautiful! I was literally blown away by the packaging on this Silverhawks Volume One release! Blown away! The dvd case comes with a slip-cover...and it's the most spectacular slip-cover EVER....I think! Completely unexpected to see a slip cover, let alone, one like this. The whole thing is embossed and raised on the front, sides AND back! The coloring is awesome! It is hands-down the best slip-cover that I have ever laid eyes on.
The case is a normal size dvd case and it's white/clear. Inside is a dual ""flipper"" holding the 4 dvds. If you're familiar with the Red Dwarf style dvd cases then this is very similar, expect that it holds 4 instead of 3 dvds. Since the dvd case is clear-ish they put an episode listing on the back of the insert, which is nice cause they list all 32 episodes and which ones are on which disc. The 4th disc is a dual sided one with 8 episodes on one side and the special features on the other.
How do the episodes look? I play my cartoons through an XBOX 360 using an HDMI cable and a Samsung 1080p LCD 46"" tv. Why do I say that? Cause it ""could"" mean trouble. With a set-up like that you see a lot of crackle and pop that you normally wouldn't see on an SD TV. I can happily say that WB actually cleaned up the episodes! In my opinion they look better than the WB Thundercats release. The restoration process is on par with the BCI Bravestarr or classic He-Man/She-Ra releases....it's nice.
The menu screens are also in widescreen!!!!
Overall, I'm shocked WB put such an effort into Silverhawks. From experience, I figured it would be similar to a Thundercats release but WB has surprised me.
This thing is freaking nicer than Fox's latest Simpsons release and that's just crazy. This Silverhawks set won't even sell a fraction of what that Simpsons season 11 will sell and it's 50x better. The only thing that could have sweetened the deal more would have been a booklet detailing each episode...but WB isn't BCI.

My last comment: If you are an 80's cartoon fan or even a mild one, don't pass this one up! If this volume one has poor sales there is a good chance that we will never see volume 2 and that would be a shame. Please, get off the fence and buy! You will not regret it!"
824,5.0,"For anyone who remembers Philippe Petit and what he did in 1974 or for anyone who doesn't remember or wasn't around in 1974 have I got a documentary for you to watch. And let me tell you, you will not watch a more suspenseful, enthrallying film that will leave you on the edge of your seat like ""Man On Wire"". And remember I just said this was a documentary. This isn't some action packed thriller. It's a freaking documentary. Documentaries are suppose to be informative, educational, maybe sometimes even amazing. Some may also say however that documentaries are boring. Boring as hell in fact. If you think that way then just watch ""Man On Wire"" and be prepared to have those thoughts about documentaries changed.

The film is about Philippe Petit and his walk on a high wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center on August 7th 1974. But there is much more to the film then that. It looks at his life from a teenager when he first started developing an interest in wire walking to becoming a street performer in Paris. One day at the age of 18 while waiting to see a dentist Petit read an article about how the World Trade Center was going to be built in New York. Reading that would cause an obsession to occur in Petit to want to walk across the towers once they were built. In the meantime he would go on to perfect his craft and started making a name for himself as a performer. Especially with two stunts. One that saw him string a wire across the two towers of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and walk across it to walking across the Bay Harbor Bridge in Sydney Australia. In both cases he had to do both stunts secretly without any approval by government authorities. In both cases he was lead off by the police after it was all over but with no major charges levied against him.

To be able to walk across the twin towers would cause Petit to have to do the same thing and that is where the suspense of this film comes in. Along with Philippe the other members who worked to set up the secret mission planned for the towers are interviewed and talk about the years of planning and preparation to pull off this death defying stunt. As they talk about what had to take place to do all this actors re-create the scenes of the events. So many times at so many moments as they made plenty trips to the WTC to study the structure and roofs of the towers they came close to being caught and having their plans revealed. Getting their equipment in the building that Petit would need to accomplish the feat was no easy matter either with all the tension involved as they worked to get all the stuff to the top without being found out. I won't go into any detail what took place. You have to watch for yourself to see what happens to make this obsession of Petit come to fruition. I am just telling you to be prepared to be captivated by this documentary. During the part where Petit and the rest are talking about him walking across the towers you see news reel footage here and there of the World Trade Center as it is being constructed. From when it was started as a big hole in the ground to the opening dedication of the twin towers. You can't help as you watch the footage of the towers going up but remember the day they came down. The film itself makes no mention of the fate of the WTC. It doesn't have to. The image of them coming down are part of our memories forever. Instead it just reminds us of that one August day in 1974 when one man made a city look up at the towers in awe and wonder. Looking at it not in horror but in amazement as that one man walked on a wire across the towers several times.

 Also know that if you have seen or heard of the movie ""The Walk"" that was released recently that movie is based on this documentary. I have not seen ""The Walk"" yet but I look forward even more now to watch it after seeing this film. As for ""Man On Wire"" I would list this as one of the very best documentaries I have ever seen. In fact I would rate this probably one of the top 5 best documentaries I have seen. Watch this yourself and you will see what I mean."
825,5.0,Amazing how much I related to this movie. It was freaking funny!
826,4.0,"When I first heard that Mike Judge had a movie coming out a few years back, I was not interested.  Nothing against Beavis and Butthead, but it just didn't seem like someone responsible for that could come up with a live-action movie that would really stand out to me, and the fact that it started from a tiny cartoon that was so exceedingly simple that it probably could have only been funny for the minute in which it took place.  By the time it was out on video, something convinced me to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did.  This movie is a joy to watch, and it never ceases to keep me laughing even after seeing it multiple times.  Judge has changed very mundane facets of the working life into hilarious scenarios: from driving to work amidst traffic to theme days at work, he caught it all.  Basically, it's freaking hilarious!"
827,5.0,"DBZ freaking rocks! This blu-ray is fantastic. This also has the classic American Soundtrack which aired when it ran on Toonami, which is the one I actually liked. I tried the other audio track, and it just sounded straight-up out of place."
828,4.0,"I freaking love this movie - no, it's not scary or creepy or anything like that, but if you've ever seen any of the SC movies, you know what you're in for. Personally, I thought this was was a pretty fun one, but only if you're in the mood for something light-hearted and you don't expect anything more than you've already gotten in the previous movie. The SC franchise really seems to have a love-hate relationship with the horror fan base. People either ""get"" it and are on board for cheesy jokes, cheesy acting, and cheesy kills, and love em, or they really, truly hate em. This one, for me, is the second best, after the original (which, while the same humor-wise) has one of the freakiest and most memorable final 30 seconds of any horror film ever made. I've seen this one probably five times, and I recently rented it again, just for the lolz."
829,5.0,"Jane is a freaking genius with observation and technique.  He understand perfectly how the mind works and how to get people to confess.  He pays attention to detail that never differ or stray such as body language, reaction and other things that are so ingenius."
830,5.0,"Gurren Lagann is one of the best anime titles out there. It's art style is what sets it apart from all the rest. This crazy hand drawn style (though I'm not entirely sure if it is hand drawn) may turn off some, but I personally dig it. I knew what to expect after buying Dead Leaves. This is a bit more tame (story wise) compared to Dead Leaves, but still off the chain none the less. The story line is great. There is a little over the top acting at times but that is kinda like the soul of this series. The whole freaking crew is over the top! And I love that about it!
This is the final two volumes packaged as Part 3. It was worth every dollar spent, and I highly recommend it!

They now have the complete series for a cheaper price."
831,3.0,All I can say is it is about freaking time.  We waited 2 or 3 years for season 3 to finally make its way to dvd.  Sony is so slow in putting out some of their series.  I hope season 4 gets a release a lot sooner than season 3 did.  Very happy to finally get season 3.
832,1.0,"If you hated Blair Witch Project then you will hate this movie... if you liked BWP... oh who the hell am i kidding, the best part of this movie was the art on the front and back cover.. oh, and the art on the dvd itself... oh kay, i get the low budget and independant angle...(if you want that in your Zombieness then get yourself a copy of Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things!!!) but maybe i never should have watched George R's Diary of the Dead... which freaking ROCKS and is his best yet!!!!
ANYHOW... this movie is more about MAN and how they behave in a Zombie world...or better yet how man's insanity is allowed to go unchecked in a world without law enforcement!!! same yourself some cash and skip this movie... unless you buy it used or you run across it in a bargan bin for under $6.00!!!!"
833,5.0,"I loved this movie.  Both Scarlett and Penelope were amazing in it!  Penelope played the crazy ex to the freaking hilt and Scarlett was fabulous as the woman who forever tries to find herself; the man they both went for (and Scarlett's best friend did too) was excellent in his role; unlike other times when you cannot imagine what a woman would see in someone, the lead man everybody went for was appealing in a very natural, adorable way even though ever inch of him still spelt the word ""womanizer"".  I recommend to anyone who loves Scarlett as much as I do to check her out in the incredible film Match Point also written by Woody Allen where he is not in it; Match Point is an amazing thriller and Scarlett is incredible in it.  I highly recommend Vicky Cristina Barcelona and somebody didn't like the narration however I actually thought it even enhanced an already great film."
834,5.0,"I went to Anime USA and got a copy right from the Funimation table in the Dealers' Room.  And got it autographed by Caitlin Glass, who is the ADR director and the voice of Haruhi Fujioka.  It cost me 50 dollars, but with 13 episodes, tons of extras and a school badge, that's freaking cheap!  Funny, touching, romantic, with such Voice Actresses as Luci Christian, Carrie Savage, Kate Oxley and Monica Rial how could you NOT buy this DVD set?  Buy it the second it is available.  Of course, if you had been a real fan you would have it by now."

836,5.0,"This show is probably better then we even know. This is a part of history from the 90s. Although I like married with children better then this, this comes right after it. Its really sad what happened to Phil Hartman. He was such a funny guy and then to have his life end at what some call his peak in such a tragic way. Season 5 tried but I really feel that it just didn't work, but it was still funny none the less. Oh and I just don't understand that Andy Dick what the heck is wrong with him... you always see him on some stupid reality TV show about rehab or something it is so freaking lame he is in his 40's, while I'm 20 and more mature then him..."
837,2.0,"...the ball was dropped on this film. Someone in Hollywood believed Brendon Fraiser and Jet Li in the same film would miraculously make this a winner. That someone should lose his job.

Synopsis: Ancient Chinese warlord is reawakened (along with 10,000 Terra Cotta warriors) to conquer the world. And there are Yetis....

The first two movies in the series were fantastically entertaining. You had action, emotion, love, despair, and discoveries of a linked past that made the movies engrossing. They had excellent scripts, beautiful effects, and acting that made it look real. I watch them over and over. This dog...well, at least I watched until the end.

Whoever cast this movie screwed the pooch. Fraser, as Rick O'Connell is, of course, excellent. I love the gung ho balls ahead character. He IS the character. In fact, he is the franchise.

Rachael Weisz declined to return citing problems with the script. Boy did she make the right call. So Maria Bello is cast as Evy. Dear God In Heaven. what where they thinking! Where Weisz played Evuy with emotion, perfect timing, and a boatload of sex appeal, Bello is a block of freaking wood who phones in her part. She has NO fluidity, no sense of timing, and not a trace of sex appeal. In fact, a block of wood could have done a much better job.

In the 2nd film, The Mummy Returns, the son, Alex, has a very strong `proper' English accent and typical `Brit' attitude. In this movie, Alex (Luke Ford) has NO trace of accent or his English upbringing. He plays the role like a young John Wayne, as if he was raised in Arizona. It totally fails.

Jet Li as Emperor Han...well, I loved him in Lethal Weapon 4, Unleashed, and The One. He should have done the role of Emperor Han with the same soft-sneering attitude he had in LW4. But he wasn't directed that way in this film. He was concrete, and wooden. There was no sense of surprise upon awakening 2000 years later. No marveling at the changes in the world. No wonder at how the world had changed. Totally unrealistic.

Redeeming factors: Michelle Yeoh (very big star in China) as Zi Yaun, the witch who betrays Han knowing his merciless character, Isabella Leong as her immortal daughter, and Russell Wong as General Ming Guo (Han's right hand man who falls in love with Zi Yaun). John Hannah plays Evy's gold-digging brother seamlessly from the prior films.

And there are the Yetis. Ya gotta love the Computer Graphics. At first, the Yetis were fluff, but then you start to like them. They are the `untarnished good' surrounded by evil.

The special effects are admirable. The battle scenes at the end are exceptional. The warriors (and Han) turning to sand and clay are so cool, myself and my friends all gave it a big `WHOA!'.

Rent it, just to see it. Own it, ONLY if you need to complete the series.

Hope this helps you decide."
838,4.0,"I wanted to ask the Night Gallery fans out there about Season Two: Episode Eleven: ""The Flip Side of Satan."" I originally saw this episode (twice) on the SciFi channel during the late nineties. The version on the DVD I just purchased is quite different. When I viewed it on the SciFi channel, the episode contained scenes of what appeared to be an abandoned small town with the wind blowing leaves, etc., about.  There were also close-ups of grotesque faces (demons?) that can still be seen on the opening montage, and hokey, soft focused shots of a woman calling out in distress (and even tumbling down?) to the main character, in what was perhaps memory flashbacks.

All of this is gone on the DVD.  Instead, there are somewhat long conversations on the phone between the DJ and two unseen ""friends"" that explain why he has been sent to this isolated town on this strange assignment. I vaguely remember some of the conversation but not them going on as long or going into as much detail; it's almost as if the DJ is reciting the plot; it doesn't feel very convincing that these are spontaneous conversations.  The whole episode falls flat as it is just the DJ, ""Jay-Jay"" (sp?)talking on the phone and freaking out; you only see the outside world when he initially pulls up in the car. There are no disturbing visuals to go with the creepy music & eerie, satanic verse on the record albums.

The reason I am mentioning this is that I was disappointed with this version; while the other one was somewhat corny, I was fond of it; it had atmosphere and a sense of mystery, which this version seems to be lacking. Does anyone know if there were two versions to begin with, and which one was the original, or was the original just edited and I'm not fully remembering the phone dialogue?  Thanks!

As has been mentioned, there are quite a few gems in this collection, whereas some episodes were just silly, and others are not aging as well. Rod Serling is perfect as the narrator/guide and I really appreciate the whole concept behind the gallery of dark paintings, and as he puts it: ""statuary.""  This is an historically important series and I wish it could be redone/restored to the full vision and intent Serling had for it."
839,1.0,"I watched this while folding laundry, even then it was a freaking waste of time.

The actors, they may have been OK.

The writers should be shot for this.

The producers, they should be shot as well.

This piece of crap should never have made it to production."
840,5.0,"Taking a trip into Wes Anderson's head is like going into a parallel universe where most things are the same, but the nature of reality is just slightly warped.

And while the world of ""Bottle Rocket"" -- Anderson's first collaboration with actor Owen Wilson -- is a little rough around the edges, the absurdist crime caper is a jewel. And while it sounds like yet another goofy comedy, Anderson's signature quirkiness is already in place -- a heavy dose of his dry, erratic, clever wit and some lovable misfit characters.

After being treated for exhaustion (""You haven't worked a day in your life. How could you be exhausted?""), Anthony (Luke Wilson) has just been released from a voluntary mental hospital.

His ""rescuer"" is his idealistically weird pal Dignan (Owen Wilson), who has decided to become a master criminal. To this end, he has created an elaborate 75-year plan of theft and heists. You can guess where that's going to take them. After an absurd first heist, they recruit the timid Bob (Bob Musgrave) as the getaway driver, as he is the only one who has a car.

And so the odd little trio practice for a while on smaller-time burglaries, such as robbing a bookstore and Anthony's own house -- then hiding out at a motel, where Anthony falls in love with the pretty South-American maid (Lumi Cavazos). However, the guys find themselves in hot water when they bump into a REAL master criminal (James Caan), and Bob bails out on them. The hot water is rising.

Comedic crime caper movies are hard to make, because of the need for balance between the criminal activities and the comedy... without making any of it too stupid or over the top. Wes Anderson solves this dilemma by making this a caper carried off by affluent young slackers who could easily do stuff other than thieving their way through life. And that's half of ""Bottle Rocket's"" comedy appeal right there -- the unlikely criminals.

The other half is handling humor that would be stupid and forgettable in another auteur's hands. Wes Anderson's uniquely quirky touch is a little rough in his full-length debut, but it's that slightly unpolished touch that makes his offbeat style such a delight here -- as an example, Anthony ""escapes"" from a hospital that he can leave anytime he wants. That unnecessarily complex opener sets the tone of the rest of the movie, of thrill-seeking young men who are just a little out of sync with the rest of the world.

And ""Bottle Rocket"" shares the dry, funny, erratic humor of Anderson's later movies, albeit in a slightly more energetic manner (""Here are just a few of the key ingredients: dynamite, pole vaulting, laughing gas, choppers..."" Dignan explains). And the scripting is peppered with a thousand funny little lines (""Which part of Mexico are you from?"" ""Paraguay""). Anderson and Wilson avoid being self-consciously cool, in favor of being earnestly quirky.

And the Wilson brothers -- Owen and Luke both -- are in fine form here as the Odd Couplish friends, especially when interacting with one another. Anthony is calmer, more laid-back and thinks a lot, while Dignan is idealistic and wacky almost to the point of mental illness. This pair have a certain innocence despite their illegal ambitions, and while they're goofy misfits, they're not the kind you laugh at.

Since most of Wes Anderson's work has been released in a Criterion deluxe edition, it's about freaking time someone gave similarly loving care to ""Bottle Rocket."" Both the forthcoming double-disc DVD edition and the Blu-ray edition are going to have a wealth of extras for fans of Anderson's, and it's hard to imagine that there's any more it would need. Criterion has apparently not only put in everything it needs, but actually slightly more.

In particular, it has newly restored picture, eleven deleted scenes that were left on the cutting room floor, actor/director commentary from Anderson and Owen Wilson, a new documentary about the making of the film, screen tests, storyboards, behind the scenes photographs, and a booklet with essay by James L. Brooks and ""appreciation"" by Martin Scorsese. As an extra bonus, it has some short films as well -- a 1970s half-hour film called ""Murita Cycles"" about a bicycle repairman/philosopher, and the 1994 short film ""Bottle Rocket"" that served as the basis for the full-length one.

""Bottle Rocket"" is a bit erratic and rough around the edges, but it's also fresh, weird and delightfully zany. Anderson should try his hand at this sort of stuff again, because he has a rare talent for such films."
841,5.0,Funniest freaking show since Seinfeld!!
842,4.0,"It seemed that the show's writers had two main objectives this season: 1)Fire up the chemistry between Erica Durance and Tom Welling full blast and 2)Create and carry out a plausible introduction of Doomsday to Smallville. They accomplished both - a remarkable feat given that the ""genius"" in charge of actor contracts hired Erica Durance for a mere 12 shows out of 22! But this is a testament to Durance's talent and presence - she owns most of her scenes. Then on the Doomsday arc - it was clever the way they used the Pilot footage to integrate the Davis Bloom/ Doomsday character. I do think they went nauseatingly overboard with the use of Chloe in the Doomsday arc but thankfully, there was a payoff: (Fingers crossed) This season may mark the end of the uber-annoying hold Chloe had on Clark. I swear sometimes it seemed like Clark was Chloe's pet doggy and she scolded him whenever he displeased her and patted him when he obeyed her -oh, these lazy and cheap writers/producers - they consistently use the chloe character as a shortcut in plot points instead of using the more interesting but expensive comic book routes. Here's hoping this changes next season. One of my all out favorite exchanges from the finale is when Chloe tells Clark (paraphrased), ""It's the human emotions that have made you the hero that you are."" And Clark responds, ""It's those emotions that keep me from being the hero I could be."" Oh, snap! Hopefully, this really is the end of Smallville's watered down, couch-sitting, Hamlet-like version of Clark Kent and the producers will stay true to their word and move the show in line with the comics - which I hope includes getting rid of Chloe. Fine, don't kill her off but, please, get rid of her!! One character I was not sorry to see go was the queen-of-all-things-obnoxious, lana lang. I was heartbroken to see her back this season in five episodes. I took off one star for this terrible imposition the show runners forced on us. And, I totally agree with a previous reviewer in that her story arc was not only ridiculous, but laugh-out-loud insanely moronic! I, too, almost stopped watching the show because of this particular plot point. Seriously, Jimmy Olsen makes a more believable superhero than lang. Here's to this really and truly being the end of her! Speaking of Jimmy Olsen, I was briefly upset at the writers killing him off but, it was ... callously inventive how they introduced his little brother to be the ""real"" Jimmy Olsen who will become Superman's Pal and Lois Lane's sidekick. Aaron Ashmore has an endearing quality to him but he was too assertive to be the traditional young Olsen from the comics. I sincerely wish him all the best in all he is to do. I'm going to miss seeing him on the show. The scene he had with Lois in the finale was quintessential Lois and Jimmy. They really seemed to enjoy each other. Another thing I appreciated was how the writers used more of Superman's Judeo-Christian origin. Although, the analogies were sometimes much too blatant and extremely misused. For example, peterson comparing chloe to Mary Magdalegne - PLEASE, if the real Mary had been like her, the entire world would have been seriously screwed for all time!!

All in all, I do say it is the best season of Smallville thus far due to the fact that Lois and Clark got good development in eleven of the twelve Lois Lane episodes. These particular moments are so good that I may actually buy this dvd set at the introductory price instead of waiting for the Christmas $15 sale. It seems that in the end, the multiple personality prone show runners thought this too - the DVD cover with Lois and Clark at the Daily Planet promotes the best this season had to offer and is my absolute favorite to date.
UPDATE 8/27/09
DVD Features:
1. All 22 episodes in anamorphic widescreen on 6 discs - much better than the pan and scan full screen version shown on air.
2. Two featurettes: In the Director's Chair w/ Mack and Doomsday-Making of a Monster - they couldn't have picked two more boring subjects
3. Two very interesting commentaries on two episodes -""Identity"" (producer, director and Cassidy Freeman) and ""Legion"" (producers and writer).

Episode List:
1. Oddyssey: GRADE A-
2. Plastique: B+ (deleted scene)
3. Toxic: B-
4. Instinct: B ...(deleted scenes) Focuses on Jimmy more than usual which he totally pulls off being the object of a super woman's affections and there's a really cool fight scene between her and Lois.
5. Committed: A ...The look on Clark's face when Lois admits to loving him is priceless and the last scene in the elevator is fantastic.
6. Prey: B-
7. Identity: A- ...(commentary)
8. Bloodline: A-
9. Abyss: C-
10. Bride: B ...In my opinion, the real ""Bride"" at the heart of the episode is Lois destined to belong to Superman despite the very unwelcome intrusion of the lang character. Honestly, they should have spared us.
11. Legion: B- ...(wierd deleted scene and interesting commentary by comics writer Geoff Johns - he states his regrets about not getting to write for Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen in this episode) The best non-Erica Durance episode of the season but not as solid as it could have been. Again, I agree with the previous reviewer when he said that lana lang almost managed to ruin it by showing her face.
12. Bulletproof: D ...Why was chloe still in Smallville when her new husband, Henry James Olsen was in Star City recovering from near fatal wounds inflicted on him by his new wife's would-be lover, Doomsday? Lois was the one taking care of Jimmy just so her dear, sweet, considerate cousin can stick around all her helpless friends who just can't live without her incessant, ignorant, incompetent and often murderous meddling.
13. Power: FAIL ...(deleted scenes) The butchering of Clark Kent's character and the ARC OF SUCK of lana lang in full swing courtesy of showrunners kelly souders and brian peterson, writers todd slavkin and darren swimmer and first time director alison mack. Either they were even more delusional than the lana and chloe fans or all their brains were buried in a crap infested toilet when they conceived this - it holds the shameful distinction along with Season 4's ""Ageless"" (another lang-worshiping episode as conceived by devoted worshipers al gough and miles millar though steven deknight took the blame) as the WORST EPISODE OF THE ENTIRE SERIES.
14. Requiem: D- ...(deleted scenes) The only thing that saved it from being on par in idiocy with ""Power"" is that lana ""the girl next door turned Lex Luthor free-loader turned embittered, vengeful hypocrite turned Bizarro's skank turned insane thief turned giant turn off for Clark"" lang finally left the building. The exit from Clark's life that should have stuck happend in Season 5's ""Void."" It was an extremely moving scene played to perfection by Kreuk. I actually felt for Lana and hoped the writers would empower her from then on instead, the very next episode, they had her clinging to Lex and would repeat this sickening topsy turvey for THREE FULL YEARS until this sorry excuse for a story unceremoniously pulled the plug.
15. Infamous: B+ ...Very, very special moments here. Unfortunately, this is where they decided to turn Davis Bloom into the Incredible Hulk without the heroics.
16. Turbulence: C+ ...(deleted scene) And this is where they revealed Tess to be a total mess of a woman and where they did a 180 with (Henry) Jimmy Olsen.
17. Hex: A ...(most interesting deleted scenes - there are several) The whole silly chloe-is-Lois obsessively DELUSIONAL fan theory is laid to rest. You'd think that 7 and 1/2 years would be long enough to hold on to their delusion but these very immature people just couldn't stomache accepting the fact that the icons Clark Kent and Lois Lane were NEVER created to have feeble phlegmatic temperaments.
18. Eternal: C- ...(deleted scene)
19. Stiletto: A ...The best episode of the season by far. We get Lois in a Catwoman/Huntress costume with Batman references galore and the real beginning of the legendary romance between Lois and Superman. They even used three notes of the John Williams penned theme song for Lois in the last scene. Very cool episode.
20. Beast: D- ...(deleted scenes)
21. Injustice: D- ...(deleted scenes) Tom Welling at his directorial worst, I'm sorry to say. This episode was TOTALLY POINTLESS. After viewing it the first time, it gave the impression that: 1)Oliver deeply cared for Tess, but then just a few episodes into the following season, he completely turned on her. 2)Tess is presented as a master manipulator, meticulously deliberate in every move she makes- following episode and for the entirety of season nine, she's shown to be completely clueless and bases all her decisions on pure emotion. 3)Chloe is played as a an uber-sweet, vulnerable, self-sacrificing victim of her own heroics... very next week, she's forever branded as the high priestess of delusional, narcissistic, egotistical, incompetent, murderously ignorant morons everywhere. 4)Clark seemed to actually have a solid grasp on who he is and what his purpose is then the very next episode, he declares himself to be more lost than ever - see what happens when you rely on little chloe to be your ""brain"" and ""best friend"" for eight freakingly loong years.
22. Doomsday: D ...It was not as bad as I expected it to be and has actually got me excited for the next season or two. I'll bet that Lois and eventually Lex will turn up with some form of amnesia.

The following is directed at those who are unfamiliar with this series but are considering buying this set: If you've read through most of the reviews, you've noticed that Superman fans are split into roughly four categories:

1. The Comic Book Fan Boys (mostly boys): These are intimately familiar with Superman lore and so are simultaneously horrified and fascinated by this show. They are very vocal in complaining about the changes in the traditional Superman story but continue watching this show because they love the episodes that directly foreshadow the future assured incarnation of an unleashed Superman.

2. The Generation Z Phlegmatics: These fans are the current young generation that were born between 1986-1995. Mostly, they know little if anything about Superman before ""Smallville."" So, actually, they are NOT Superman fans at all but merely ""Smallville"" fans with a penchant for the teen-age melodramatic, girly, idiotic, tragicly nonsensical romance stories the CW loves to serve them up. To them, Lana Lang is the love of Clark Kent's life and she should have never left the series. Or, if Lana had to leave then Chloe Sullivan should be Clark's bride. These have a special attachment to the manufactured Chloe character because she is one of them. Perhaps this is precisely why the show creators decided to invent this character - to speak directly to those who were teenagers and preteens when this show began. But wether they love Clana or Chlark, these fans have one thing that unites them: They all hate Lois Lane. They hate her because her character is nothing like them. They don't understand how this version of Clark Kent (whom the creators made out to be a phlegmatic-like character, at least for the first 3 seasons) can possibly fall in love with a woman like Lois - assertive, self-sufficient, irreverent and beautifully sexy with little insecurity - EXACTLY the type of woman the real Superman/Clark Kent (with his melancholic/choleric temperament) would fall hard for. The critical reviews with a 1-3 star rating are given by fans that fall into this or the previous category.

3. The Superfriend Fan: This is what I call those that are not comic book fans per se but grew up watching or became interested in the animated versions of Superfriends and Justice League. They mostly just like DC comic book superheros and are not familiar or like very much the Marvel characters or any other comic book company inventions. These fans mostly ignored this show until about season 4, 5 or 6 when Smallville started looking more like its predecessors. They take this show for what it is - a new incarnation of a favorite fictional character. As long as the major points are hit, they don't mind this version too much (unless it's something as horrendous as the superlana arc!!!).

4. Everyone Else: This is you. You've heard of Superman (how could you not?) and your parents or grandparents or great-grandparents grew up reading Superman Comic Books. When comic books were first invented in the 1930's until about the first half of the 1960's (what's considered the ""Golden Age"" of entertainment - before the dawn of the hippies and feminists and method actor take-over), reading comics was as common as reading the newspaper and were sold at all news stands for about the same price as a newspaper. Now, comic books are only sold on the internet or in specialty stores run by die-hard fans that scare off the general public for ridiculously high prices. Anyway, if you're reading this, it's probably because you like the Superman character and have become curious about this long-running show that is about the man-who-would-be. My advice: If you can easily afford it, go ahead and buy this set at the current $30-something price. You will be entertained and you'll love the classic 1940's style and feel to the sets and costumes - especially where Clark Kent and Lois Lane are concerned. If you're still unsure, wait for this to go on sale (it always does - usually within a year of release) for under $20. You won't regret this purchase. Ignore the negative reviews - as previously noted, they were made by disgruntled fans and not a true reflection of the high production quality of this show. Even if you don't much care for Superman, you will be wowed by the sizzling, sparkling, combustible chemistry between Erica Durance and Tom Welling."
843,5.0,"This second season broadens the Chuckverse even more and, this time, the series gets the 22 episode treatment. Chuck Bartowski is still the human Intersect, never mind that he just wants that thing out of his head already so he can go back to his normal life. Sexy CIA super-agent Sarah Walker and hardcase NSA Major John Casey are still babysitti - er, protecting Chuck from villains of all colors. All three are still out saving the world every week. Chuck is in love with Sarah, that hasn't changed. We think Sarah reciprocates, but it's this whole drama. Oh, and there's a rumor that John Casey may have a heart (but it's just a rumor).

Chuck still provides tech support at the Buy More electronic store, except that as the episodes go on, dude's attendance rate seems to be falling on the shady side. Sarah is still his cover girlfriend, except that she's swapped her hot dog vending gig for selling yogurt at the Orange Orange shop. Casey, he's still a disgruntled employee at the Buy More. It's his cover - except that the disgruntled part is real. Oh, and our agents gain a hi-tech spy lair.

Each episode produces its share of nerdgasm, that much hasn't changed. Chuck is clumsy as ever, is geeky as ever, wears his heart on his sleeve as ever. But, sometimes, actually a lot of times, it's Chuck's good heart that ends up key to resolving the mission. The show maintains the same formula of juxtaposing the main story arc - which is Chuck and his minders engaged in slick secret agent stuff - with oddball levity at the Buy More. From the spy side of things, there's a new player in the form of Fulcrum, a nasty espionage organization desperate to create its own Intersect, and from there shape an army of super-agents. And, by the way, who knew Chevy Chase had it in him to play a credible villain?

On the Buy More side, the series digs deeper into the strange Nerd Herd characters. Several dubious Assistant Managers get a crack to crack the whip. We learn about the rock band Jeffster, and that that loser Jeff used to be a video arcade celeb, and that Chuck's best bud Morgan may actually be the true heart and soul of the Nerd Herd. And the concept of the BuyMoria nation is introduced.

Particularly gratifying are the arcs centering on Chuck's ex-girlfriend Jill (played by the lovely Jordana Brewster) and also on Chuck's efforts to find the father who'd abandoned him and his sister Ellie. We also get a satisfying peek at Sarah and Casey's back stories. And then just when we thought we'd seen the last of him, the dashing secret agent Bryce Larkin pops up here and there, and there goes Chuck again, suffering pangs of jealousy and inadequacy. My favorite episodes are... well, I really liked all of them. But, okay, ""Chuck Versus the Cougars"" and ""Chuck Versus the Delorean"" give us glimpses into Sarah's messed-up past. ""Chuck Versus the Ex"" introduces Chuck's college sweetheart, the one who broke his heart and slept with Bryce Larkin. ""Chuck Versus the Colonel"" and ""Chuck Versus the Ring"" close out the season and bring several plot threads to a head, with regards to Fulcrum, Awesome and Ellie's big wedding, and Chuck and Sarah's ever-shifting relationship. Except that you know, don't you, that in Season 3, the writers find a way to put that romance on hold again?

CHUCK - THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON comes in 6 discs and with these nifty Special Features: ""Truth, Spies & Regular Guys: Exploring the Mythology of CHUCK""; ""Dude in Distress"" - Explore Some of This Season's Best Action Sequences - this segment also shows how enthused Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski were about doing their own stunts; ""Chuck Versus the Webisodes: Web-Originated Mini-featurettes""; A Real Life Captain Awesome's Tips for Being Awesome"" - these are fun spoofs of those old NBC ""One to Grow On"" PSAs with the guy who plays Devon (a.k.a.

844,1.0,"WTF ? Huh ? There is never any indication that a story is unfolding. Other than the skull hatcheting piece by bloody bandage head guy and the arm sawing through the jailhouse bars scene, there's little to discuss or keep you interested except maybe well-hung blu guy Dr. Manhatten driving girl to glowing blue extacy. A freaking, jigsawing, nightmare. Intended strictly for comic book advocates who enjoy speed viewing tales of their super heroes."
845,1.0,"Here's the really short review: It's 2 hours of your life you'll never get back. Pretty much what they did was just repackage ""Transformers"" and release it again. So if you liked that mindless film . . . then you're a 3 year old on a sugar high and will watch anything with lots of flashing colors and loud noises.

In a nut shell, this is 2 hours of mindless CGI action sequences.  Then the ""acting"" bolts the computer generated sequences together. And that acting? Yeah, that was just dreadful. It was like scenes cut out of a daytime melodrama.

Were I watching this by myself, I would have turned it off half way through and found something else to do.

So here's how I made it to the end of this train-wreck:  Before watching it, my friends and I got on you-tube and found the video of Christian Bale freaking out on Peter Griffin from family guy. The whole way through the movie we were blurting out lines from that sketch.  ""Do you want me to rip your [...] lights down?!?"" response: ""Those are Christmas lights; I put them up so everyone would be happy.""

So we'd all start laughing and try to forget how terrible this flick was."
846,1.0,"Cant say anything about the movie really, what I got to see was pretty good. I have satellite internet and I was not impressed in the manner in which amazon downloads the movies, small bits at a time. their signal kept getting lost, even though my satellite was fine, not sure what the problem was, but I really don't care to watch a movie in 15 minute intervals-download the whole freaking movie geeeez-doubt I ever use amazon video again, was terrible."
847,3.0,"As an on-again, off-again follower of the Vertigo comic this is based upon, I was all geared up to hate it mightily before it had even spun up in the DVD player. With that said, it fares somewhat better than I'd expected. It isn't a raging success story, but it's not a tragic insult to the rich, lengthy source material either. Keanu Reeves is a horrible choice for the lead, no doubt about that - where the funny book Constantine is a complex, witty, bitter but charismatic subculture hero, Keanu's interpretation is as nuanced as a bag of bricks. I don't know how much I can fault the actor for that - after all, he's been playing dress-up with the same character for two decades now - but regardless of where the blame lies, he lacks the unspoken authenticity that role needs to get off the ground. Fortunately, the blow is softened somewhat by a dynamite intro sequence that may as well have been ripped straight from the pages of the comic and a decent, if indulgent, central storyline. With a full-blown war between heaven and hell at its core, it would've been very easy to get overly adventurous with the film's scope, but it wisely maintains a short focal range and that keeps things mostly grounded. It won't be finding a home on anyone's top ten list, and it's not easy to look past Keanu being Keanu (with Shia freaking LaBeouf crammed in as a throwaway sidekick), but the tone is right and the special effects work is a grand success. Not nearly what it could've been, but also not what I feared it would become."
848,2.0,"If you think Season Seven was terrible, wait until you see Season Eight. Now, that is a stinker. So, the new theme of the season is...Let's Save the World (And Be a Hypocrite at the Same Time). So many contradictions, so much bad writing, so much recycled junk stories, and so many incomprehensibly ""whatever"" moments...`tis the Soap Opera season to be utterly forgettable. I think the Reunion episode is the worst of Season Eight with the finale coming a close second. While watching the former, I am thinking the entire time, ""What reunion?"" because the 90210 gang is as clique as it comes. No one made a lifelong friendship outside of the group during high school, and the audience never really knew anyone else from high school setting at West Beverly High. If there was a handful of them making cameos, well...we didn't see any of them there. Just random characters that we never saw before. So, it would have made a lot of sense to have a one terrifically boring reunion at either Donna's apartment or Brandon's house. When (the old looking) Andrea Zuckerman shows up for the reunion, it is almost as if she is a unrecognizable character who used to be in 90210 eons ago. Not that she was memorable anyway. The latter episode, it is nice to see Jim and Cindy Walsh back together making a cameo appearance, yet something is so strange about it: they are practically strangers to Seasons One to Five audience. I just find that one amazing, and the message is apparent: the series is officially over. It is simply dead without a pulse. Worst of all, there are two more seasons to go. Wow, it is going to be very hard for me to stay motivated and chug along through the episodes. Let's go through the list of characters, shall we?
Brandon Walsh: Gosh...can there be a more sickening character than Brandon on the show? Because he is so full of bags of turd, I just want to punch him in the nose. One episode, he was defending himself in an argument with Kelly that he had morals to uphold. Hello! Brandon, you have no morals whatsoever to speak of; they all disappeared in Season One. Let me count off what Brandon is: he is a cheat (two times on Kelly!), an addicted gambler, a uncontrollable drinker, a violator of professional conduct (slept with three women via workplace romance and helping Steve to get away, among many things, with a fraternity prank by deleting video), a drunk driver, a person of temper tantrums, a womanizer (had a lot of one night stands including one with a stripper and was going to have one with a lesbian while struggling with the post-breakup with Kelly), an academic cheater, a stalker, and an annoyance. Also, he let Kelly to get shot in the belly because he wanted to act tough! Brandon...just shut the hell up. Five more episodes left in the next season, and Brandon is gone forever.
Kelly Taylor: The darling of the show is back. Poor Kelly, she gets shot in the belly and suffers amnesia from it at the beginning of Season Eight. I am happy to see her not to get married (is that so predictable or what?) to Brandon in the end. For some reason, I feel she can do much better than her current situation.
Donna Martin: Wow...what happened to Donna? She sure resembles Mr. Hyde much of the season. She used to be so happy, naive, and charitable yet during Season Eight, she has gotten so bitchy and somber. Her hairstyle is so awful that it reminds me of a toxic waste dump. The mix of colors seems all wrong to me. She becomes the seventh regular cast member to (is this getting old already?) abuse drugs. Donna designing her clothes, boy...ever seen her wearing her own designed clothes at any time of the show?
Steve Sanders: I used to like him in the beginning for about five to six seasons, and then, I've started to get weary of him. He just has this same, boring routine with women, and it seems to me that it's all he needs to make his life complete. Quite frankly, I am getting sick and tired of it. If he loved Carly and Zach so much, then why not move to Montana with them? What's so freaking hard about it? And he sure got over it pretty fast. Besides that, as it is a big recurring problem with just about every couple in the history of the series, there is virtually no chemistry between Steve and Carly. As hard as it is to believe, Hilary Swank is the one out of all actors and actresses of the series to make it big outside of the show.
David Silver: *sighs* The talentless musician with a need to control people that revolve around him, David manages to disgust the hell out of me in every episode that he appears in. I am just really surprised that he only got a year probation for indirectly shooting at Gwyneth's arm with a gun (how boring, reliving Dylan's paranoia all over again). And she sure didn't show any feelings about it afterwards. How convenient. His relationship with Valerie is one of the biggest reasons why the series sank further through the abyss of mediocrity because it is a big nothing. And I wasn't even aware that they were together at any point of the time despite the lack of chemistry between the two. Remember that he saw a $2,000 check get bounced on him for his jingles work? How stupid was that he decided to be paid in form of clothes? He really has no idea how business works, does he?
Noah Hunter: While it is easy to somewhat like him, Noah sure comes off as an idiot the entire season. His actions and methods of dealing with many situations are questionable and puzzling at best. I just don't see him with Donna because there is absolutely nothing between them that indicates love. Probably it's another ploy by Tori to get what she wants like how she did with that firefighter stud (yeah, like it will happen). Why did Noah have to bail David out by paying the loan shark? And why did he have to stay in Beverly Hills and waste his time with the gang? There are so many better places to waste time in and better people to hang out with.
Valerie Malone: *yawn* Do I really care? Bye-bye, Valerie...she will be gone after seven episodes in Season Nine. Her crap wasted my time, had nothing to do with reality, and drained every remaining amount of energy left in the series. Every time she reasons things out, it's like watching her trying to square a circle. I'm just tired of her; she should have been cut out at some point during Season Eight. Oh, the HIV test? Let me save you the suspense: it's negative. This shouldn't shock you either: nothing bad ever happens to the regular cast members. And they always recover in an amazing pace.
Nat Bussichio: I understand that he had been on the series as long as everybody else has been, and I understand that he is part of the opening credits. But let's be real: does he really serve any purpose whatsoever for 90210? He just cooks hamburgers and runs a restaurant where the gang will congregate from time to time. If you haven't noticed, Brandon had never talked to Nat at any time during Season Eight, considering that he used to look at him as a second father figure from beginning seasons. Wow, things have changed a lot, ain't they?

Finally, from time to time, the introducing opening credits will have a moment of corniness from time to time. But this one may have taken the cake: it's the one where Brandon and Steve are bouncing off each other by their chests. Also, if I look at the subsequent rolling credits showing names of the guest stars, I find the MTV style editing incredibly annoying. If you look at many of the cuts, they are actually old ones from early 90's, showing a lot of people wearing extremely out-of-date fashion clothes. Speaking of laziness, look at the many subplots during Season Eight. I believe that every single of them, except for a couple, was touched at one point or another in the past seven seasons. Some of them were touched so frequently that they got very stale.

All in all, I just can't believe Beverly Hills 90210 survived for two more seasons; Season Eight is simply a disaster."
849,4.0,I didn't think it was as funny as Big Lebowski but its pretty freaking smart. The Coens are brillant and I'll see anything they do because their such great flimmakers.
850,4.0,"Well I really like Tenacious D.  I think Jack Black and Kyle Gass are funny in the movies I have seen them in.  They seem like cool guys who have a band because they like to have one.  They don't need the money.  Plus how much do they actually get.  Well that's what I usually think when I hear them.  That kind of changed after seeing this DVD.  I will tell you why below.  I will also tell you about some other problems I had with this DVD.

Well I was sitting in my room at night, looking forward to seeing Jack and Kyle play some music and make me laugh.  While I did see that, there were also other people who were part of the band as well.  It sounded good to me.  But I am used to Tenacious D being just a 2 person band.  You have to get used to the other people playing with them.  It makes sense because they have something happen that looks like they go to hell.  The other band members meet them there and play with them.  There is also someone who just dances.  I didn't think about it until I watched the commentary.  Not sure how easy it will be to get used to this.  It kind of seemed like I was watching a play.  Again, I'm not sure if I liked this or not.  I mean I guess I did.  But It wasn't the D I was used to.

Now the camera.  This may have been the worst thing about this show.  The camera was moving the WHOLE time.  Seriously, as soon as you would get a good shot of Jack or Kyle playing, they would switch cameras.  It kind of made me feel sick.  I was saying to myself ""stop moving the freaking camera so much!""  I may have more of a problem with this because I only have 10% of my vision.  But It seems to me that there are others will get sick of the movement of the camera.

I think I would give the concert a 3.8 out of 5.  But the bonus features I would give a 5.  You get to see the D one a few TV shows.  As well as see the band going on tour and just living without having to act.  Some of the things said during this point I can't be sure if they are true or just the band joking around.  Like Kyle getting mad that he was not set to go on one of the shows with black.  As well as some of the other things said by the guys.

In the end though, if you like the band, you will enjoy the DVD.  You get to see the guys playing live with some of there best songs.  You also get to see the band a little different from what you may be used to.  Also, you get to see the guys when they are not in front of a big crowd or in front of a live TV audience.  Some may think the way they have set up the show is strange.  But give it a chance.  I'm sure you will enjoy.

852,2.0,"I would like to start off by saying I'm a fan of the FINAL DESTINATION series. Even the much maligned third film is starting to grow on me. When it was announced that David Ellis was returning to the director chair (along with screenwriter Eric Bress), I was quite excited, considering that part two is arguably the best in the series. But this one. If I were to describe this film in one word, I would say DISAPPOINTING. In fact, this is one of the most disappointing movies of this year! The fact that the makers of part two has returned just adds on to the frustration.

The film starts off pretty rushed. In fact, the film is rushed altogether. You feel as if the filmmakers wanted to get through with the film. The laziness is so apparent in here that you're wondering how much the executives offered in their salary. The film is so lazy that there are even glaring plot holes in the hackneyed script! How the hell does a film that is based on something ridiculous have plot holes? The film--better yet, the franchise, spends most of its time in setting up rules on the order people are going to die yet this film ignores practically everything and kills people in any order it feels like!

Even the clever foreshadowing from the previous films is quite blatant here. The laziness is also extended to the death scenes. Remember, quality, not quantity. Even though this film has the most death scenes compared to the previous entries, most of them suck and even that word wouldn't give the deaths that much justice. We all have to admit it sooner or later but we see these films for the death scenes. What is the freaking point in watching this film if they turn out to be lazy to an extent that some death scenes are rehashed from previous FD films? Exactly. There is no point.

Another problem about the death scenes is that there is barely any suspense when people are about to get killed. Usually, in the FD films, seeing the set up of the Rube Goldberg-like death scenes IS the suspense, but in here, they feel as if they come out of nowhere because of how rushed everything is. They're surprising, yes, but the surprises wear off very quickly. Google up Alfred Hitchcock's definition of ""suspense"" to learn the difference between surprise and suspense.

Let's move on to the next problem: CGI. With the 3D technology, it's obvious the filmmakers wanted to add more CGI effects so the images could pop out on the screen. The problem here is that the FINAL DESTINATION series is always known for their practical effects. The premonition sequence in here works well in 3D, sure, but the CGI is terrible! They look so fake that I questioned how this film wasn't released direct to DVD.

You know you have a bad film when a franchise that was supposed to be scary and mysterious now turns into something that pokes fun of itself. It has happened many times before, most notably, the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise. It's as if the filmmakers were aware that the franchise is dying and that their last attempt was to add self-aware characters and idiotic, dumb lines in the film with the many problems the film already has.

Even the characters are more like an excuse to kill them off later. It's apparent that this isn't a movie but more of a carnival ride, waiting to see who dies and how they will die. That's how low this film has gone. You'd also be surprised to find out that the most fleshed out character is, in fact, not the protagonist, but a supporting character, played by Mykelti Williamson. He gives a laughable and forced performance but that's nothing compared to Bobby Campo, who is easily the worst premonitionist in the franchise. He can't act to save his life. And the less we say about the others, the better. However, I'm willing to admit the only character I did feel sympathy for was played by Krista Allen, who plays a motherly role with an extremely short running time.

However, there are other few things that I liked about the film (emphasis on the word ""few""): There's a sequence in a salon and a car wash that have at least SOME suspense. I don't know if this counts but I also liked the opening credits, which I thought was ingenious, a montage of the previous films' memorable death scenes. And that's about it. Three things. What an accomplishment!

I guess it isn't hard to tell but this is, by far, the weakest in the series because there's nothing new. You'd expect that a mythology so easily expandable would be explored here but no. By the end of the film, you feel underwhelmed. You wished they could have done better. In fact, you KNOW they could have done better. If they were to make a fifth film, they better put some thought into it. If you're thinking about watching this movie only ONCE, you should see it in its intended format in 3D AND in theaters, but I don't see why anyone should waste their money on this film."
853,5.0,The best werewolf picture in freaking years....... Dam good action in the movie...
854,1.0,"Right off, I have a request: can the writers of ""Seventh Heaven"" please stop writing Sci-fi? Honestly, I love a good horror/scifi film with religious concepts (I loved ""The Prophecy"", ""Constantine"", ""The Order"",etc), but this one slammed the viewer over the head with religion and sat back smug about it. What do I mean? Well, as soon as we are introduced to Cage's character we learn that he is a MIT professor who is teaching chaos verses determination theory in his class and that he favours the logical, nontheist based theory. Can you guess how happy his home life is? He is the single father of a hard of hearing boy and drinks himself to sleep at night because his wife died in a fire. Oh, and just to bludgeon you some more with how off course and empty his life is, his father is a minister (can someone tell me how a supposedly selfless man of the cloth lives in a house easily worthy 3 million dollars? No one touched on that) and Cage has turned his back not only on God and his family but has surrendered to ""Godless"" science and alcohol. Hmm, can you guess how this film will end? If you said (spoiler) by Cage finding that logic and reason really are the tools to a sane life and quitting drinking for rational reasons you haven't been watching the morality plays that now masquerade as scifi these days. Honestly, can there be one film in which the overeducated professor isn't rendered souless and crippled until he turns to some higher power? I bet AA people will love this one, it's straight out of the ""Blue Book"".
 Long story short, Cage's son is given a series of numbers written 50 years ago and left in a time capsule which ultimately predict the end of the world. Why is he given this? Can Cage do anything at all to stop it or to try and save humanity? Nope, it's just a doomsday clock. What a freaking let down. Oh, some aliens who appear in the form of angels show up to take a few children away to another planet (I suppose to repopulate the human species) in an obvious Adam and Eve allusion, but that raises the questions: why not take their parents? Wouldn't the children be happier and better adjusted if accompanied by their parents? And what if they don't like the kid with whom they are paired (hey, the two main kids only knew each other for two days. They might actually detest each other after spending some time together)? Also, if the aliens didn't save us because we're ""unworthy"", why continue the species? Obviously everything that makes us human in found in the chosen children. Their offspring will simply destroy this new planet. And on and on. This film had so many holes I felt as if I were watching Swiss cheese.
  I love a good apocalyptic film (The 6th Day was one of the ones I liked best) and a healthy dose of religious influence almost always adds a bit of drama, but this failed on every level. I'm sure Christians will hate the ""Aliens as Gods and Angels"" concept presented in the film, and secularists such as myself are sick of religion being presented in socalled scifi films as the panacea to all life's sorrows. Mazel tov, writers of this film, you managed to create something which irks people on both sides of the God debate. Now go hole yourself up in a church and find real religion or just try to be normal and live your lives. Either way, stop pushing this cotton candy propaganda on the American public. Peace."
855,5.0,"...and if you like high body counts, gruesome and violent deaths handed out to despicable characters, and generalized high-octane mayhem, this is a great film. Sometimes I'm in the mood for something violent, but I often get too involved with the lead characters, worrying about the next bad thing that's going to happen, getting all tense, and end up not enjoying the show (I had to stop Reservoir Dogs about twenty times and come back to it to finish it. Breaking Bad? Had to quit watching it entirely).

Enter likable, non-meathead Badass Bryan Mills (caveat: I gotta say that if he were played by, say, Vin Diesel or some other muscled-up dude, I would have hated him and given this zero stars). I love not having to worry about Bryan Mills, as he is indestructible and unstoppable, a professional in a world of amateurs, dealing death with abandon and in some cases glee. He is three steps ahead of everyone at all times and is an absolute expert at freaking everything from fisticuffs to high-performance driving to torture to administering intravenous drugs. He will humiliate and beat, pistol-whip, shoot, stab, maim, or otherwise incapacitate everyone foolish enough to stand in his path. Even while handcuffed to an overhead pipe and being garroted, you know those six thugs trying to finish him off have seconds to live and it's just damn beautiful.

No, it's not realistic in any way, shape, or form--I mean, really, how many crimes (murders!) did he commit in 72 hours while still getting out of France with nary a gendarme to be seen?-- but for pure testosterone-fueled bullet-ridden ass-kicking turn-off-your-brain, bad-guys-get-what's-coming-to-'em fun, Taken is nearly as good as the last three 007 films. Loved it."
856,5.0,"love the wolverine, it was a great movie, lots of action and Hugh Jackman is so freaking sexy and hot"
857,5.0,That was freaking awesome. I'm not a comic reader but I sure have enjoyed these Xmen movies. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good story and lots of action. It almost seems like a Wolverine side quest.
858,1.0,"What the heck is going on in Hollywood? I am sick and tired of these people who get millions to butcher different comic book canon so they can sale a movie to the masses. Let me count them off here...

1. Star Trek Into Darkness - The Khan character period. Magic blood? Single handidly kill dozens of Klingons and oh yeah, several Birds of Prey? Uhura and Spock?

2. Iron Man 3 - What the creators of this movie did to the Mandarin is a travesty. Hey, I have an idea, instead of making Tony battle alchoholism, lets give him PTSD and create some inner demons so he can battle with insignificance and mortality. Panic attacks caused by a little kid? Pepper potts is braver than Tony Stark.

3. Wolverine - The Silver Samurai is an adamantium robot? Wolverine loses his ability to heal and has to remember of find out what he is really made of? I thought this was stupid in Spider Man 2, I thought it was stupid in Iron Man 3, and it is stupid in Wolverine. Why strip a hero of his abilities to make him seem more human so we can relate better? We aren't supposed to relate, we are supposed to be amazed at what this mutant can do. NOT how he can overcome adversity because he has an inner struggle with humanity going on. Virus cause or whatever, it freaking does not matter.

I am tired of these writers taking liberties with all this canon and saying, well, the movie will sale better if we change this. Its ok if we completly change or erase a major villain from that hero's canon."
859,5.0,"You all know the cast is All-Star. The fact that they all sing their own parts with no `Ghost Singers' makes this romp based on Abba songs all the better. And by the way, Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski can sing, and I mean very very well.

The music, the scenery, the scenarios...all very excellent. And people, every actor/actress here can SING. While some think the `Dancing Queen' sequence is great, I think the Dancing Guys In Flippers (only 30 seconds long) is hilarious.

The choreography is superb. The music is great, and the whole thing is just fun.

The plot? Simple. A young girl invites three men (Firth, Brosnan, and Skarsgard) who are totally different, to her wedding. One of them, she believes, is her father. Her mother (Streep) had `encounters' with each. And each man, in return, believes himself to be the daughter he never knew of. Because of this, each man is transformed. Simple, and enough of the plot.

The movie is about the incredible music and dance sequences. Enjoy this film for that simple fact. I know I did.

And by the way, the movie is freaking funny."
860,5.0,"Bram Stoker's vampire novel has been remade dozens of times, but perhaps the best adaptation is the classic Bela Lugosi version. Fairly faithful to the novel and dripping with gothic atmosphere, what really makes ""Dracula"" stand out is the bone-chillingly charming performance by Lugosi -- one of the best Draculas ever put on film.

A solicitor, Renfield (Dwight Frye), is travelling to Count Dracula's castle for a real estate deal, despite the locals freaking out and crossing themselves whenever Dracula's mentioned. He soon finds out why -- the charming Count (Lugosi) is a vampire, who enslaves a maddened Renfield to his will. Soon after, a ship with a dead crew (and Renfield and Dracula in the hold) arrives in England.

Soon Dracula has moved into his new home, Carfax Abbey, and is insinuating himself with the Seward family -- and especially with pretty Lucy Westenra, who dies of blood loss and is reborn as a vampire. Only the intervention of the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) can stop Dracula's attacks in London, and the young people who have attracted his interest.

Then there's the Spanish-language one, which is virtually identical and was filmed on the exact same sets, during the hours when the English-language one was not being shot. Same settings, same marks, same cinematography, many of the same scenes -- although it's much longer. It's excellent, and although it lacks that iconic intensity that Lugosi brought the English-language film, it's full of atmosphere and good acting.

Technically ""Dracula"" wasn't the first adaptation of ""Dracula"" -- that honor belongs to ""Nosferatu"" -- but it was the first to actually tackle the storyline in Stoker's book, with a few changes and tweaks here and there. And to date, it's one of the few adaptations to portray everyone's favorite vampire with the necessary atmosphere -- ominous, dignified, charming, and creepy, and undoubtedly evil.

Tod Browning sets it in all the necssary places -- crumbling castles, savage mountainous villages, foggy London streets, and sumptuous Victorian drawing rooms with eerie noises from outside. Granted, a fair amount of stuff is changed -- Jonathan Harker is partially replaced by the mad Renfield, presumably to cut down on time -- but none of these really detract from the storyline.

And Browning pours the creepiness on thickly, such as Dracula's seduction of young women, which keeps up the whole idea of vampiric sexuality. But Browning also knows how to pour on the subtle horror, without blood or violence -- like any scene with Renfield.

The script is just as great as the direction, with some unspeakably good dialogue (""For one who has not lived even a single lifetime, you're a wise man, Van Helsing""), usually from Dracula. The bad guys always get the good lines. But the best scenes and dialogue are made up of highlights from the novel (such as Dracula saying dreamily, ""Listen to them, the children of the night. What music they make!""), and it gives a subtle poetry to the movie.

But the star of all this is Lugosi himself, one of the two quintessential vampire actors (the other being Christopher Lee). While he doesn't resemble the book's Dracula (he's short and round-faced), his hypnotic stare and charming, intense manner make him an ideal vampire count. And Frye deserves a nod for one of the nastiest, maddest, creepinest performances in cinema history. Sort of a nuttier, bug-eating Gollum (""Not when I can get nice fat spiders!"").

The original ""Dracula"" is still the best, more than seventy years after it was made. Dripping with Gothic atmosphere and seductive charm, this is a magnificent piece of work."
861,5.0,"Bram Stoker's vampire novel has been remade dozens of times, but perhaps the best adaptation is the classic Bela Lugosi version. Fairly faithful to the novel and dripping with gothic atmosphere, what really makes ""Dracula"" stand out is the bone-chillingly charming performance by Lugosi.

A solicitor, Renfield (Dwight Frye), is travelling to Count Dracula's castle for a real estate deal, despite the locals freaking out and crossing themselves whenever Dracula's mentioned. He soon finds out why -- the Count (Lugosi) is a vampire, who enslaves a mad Renfield to his will. Soon after, a ship with a dead crew (and Renfield and Dracula in the hold) arrives in England.

Soon Dracula has moved into his new home, Carfax Abbey, and is insinuating himself with the Seward family -- and especially with pretty Lucy Westenra, who dies of blood loss and is reborn as a vampire. Only the intervention of the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan) can stop Dracula's attacks in London.

Then there's the Spanish-language one, which is virtually identical and was filmed on the exact same sets, during the hours when the English-language one was not being shot. Same settings, same marks, same cinematography, many of the same scenes -- although it's much longer. It's excellent, and although it lacks that iconic intensity that Lugosi brought the English-language film, it's full of atmosphere and good acting.

862,5.0,"This movie is so funny you will...

--pee your pants.
--shoot soda out of your nose.
--choke on your tongue laughing.
--go to confession bc you laughed at retarded people.

It's risky, daring and oh, so graphic. Great camoes, too. Tom Cruise is freaking hilarious. Jack Black, as the struggling heroin addict is bloody brilliant. And let me just say that Robert Downey Jr. is a GENIUS! I've seen him in a lot of movies, but didn't realize the full extent of his talent until I saw this film.

It's not very Ben Stiller focused. surprisingly. But, IMHO, it is to the benefit of the film. What he is in is uber funny, though.

I hesitate to say this is a movie for the entire family (probably inappropriate for young kids), but I went with my husband, Mom and Dad and we were all ROLLING with laughter. We recapped all of the funny bits on the drive home.

Highly recommended."
863,5.0,"Over the years, Disney has gone from giving us quality to giving us garbage such as the stuff found on the Disney Channel (Shake It Up, Jessie, ANT Farm). This proves that Disney has not been as good as they used to be. Thankfully, however, some of the workers at Disney work their hardest to satisfy the fans of the older days such as myself, by re-releasing their animated movies for new generations, among other things. With the Diamond Edition of Lady and the Tramp, they are not only doing the fans of the classic Disney films justice once again, they are also doing ME some justice, as I am a huge fan of Lady and the Tramp. In fact, I was pretty hyped for this release.

The story revolves around Lady, who is a pampered Cocker Spaniel, and a streetwise Schnauzer named Tramp. One day, Lady's owners leave her with Aunt Sarah and her Siamese cats while they go on vacation. The Siamese Cats mess up the house and blame Lady for it. Aunt Sarah decides to get a muzzle for Lady at the pet shop, but then Lady runs out. Tramp spots Lady and helps her get the muzzle off. And the rest of the movie is done wonderfully.

As you can tell by the title of this review, I love this movie with all of my heart, and it happens to be my favorite Disney classic, and my second favorite movie of all time, next to Scamp's Adventure. The charm of the film is at a ridiculous high, and the quality of the sound and visual experience are at its very best.

Particularly the voice acting is among some of the best in any animated movie. Barbara Luddy is the perfect voice for Lady, and it's one of the best voice overs I have ever heard in my life. Lady happens to be my favorite character in this movie, because of her voice, and she's just so freaking cute! How could you not love her? I love her personality, her design, and anything else that is good about this character. This is one of those characters that I could just reach into the screen and hug.

Tramp also has a very good voice actor by the name of Larry Roberts. Roberts is the perfect voice for Tramp, and also adds to the character's street-wise personality. Tramp also has a very positive attitude towards his life, especially since his life is poles apart from Lady's. It's also very fun to dub this character when watching this film, just like with Scamp in the sequel. Tramp is the perfect other-half for Lady.

The art value of this film could not be any more spellbinding. The animation is some of the freshest, most vibrant animation I have seen in a Disney classic. The sole Disney Classic about animals that I think has been able to do this is Bambi. The characters in Lady and the Tramp are animated very well, and move so stunningly, almost as if they were real. This is why I miss hand drawn animation, and why animators need to step up and use this kind of animation for their movies, not computer generated animation. Yes, I like some CGI animated movies, such as most from Pixar and Dreamworks, but CGI is not a very satisfying type of animation in my eyes. Hand drawn animation is much more emotional and moving than anything of CGI.

What else does there need to be discussed about the movie? This is Disney at its best, and I hope Disney doesn't stop making re-releases of their classic movies.

Also, another thing I have to point out is the trailer for the sequel that is featured on here. Best trailer for a movie I have ever seen... hands down. Go buy the Lady and the Tramp Blu Ray for any generation. You will save the world from falling into the pit.

Rating: 5 stars/5 stars"
864,1.0,"This truly is a sad time for cinema. Oh well, when you can get a movie out of a freaking vending machine, the artistic integrity once involved in film making is thrown out the window. 2009 has been a terrible year for film."
865,2.0,"For me, I think a two star rating fits this movie quite well.
I heard about this movie only because I was reading some of the reviews on Caraval by Stephanie Garber on Goodreads, and somebody said that the book was like this movie, and since I thought that book had a cool idea, and since this movie was compared to it, I was like, okay, I should definitely give it a try.
Not what I expected.
Based on the cover I see some mind-control, duality, themes based on the checkers, not my thing, but also the colorful world if you look further into the movies cover.
THAT, is what I thought the movie was going to really be about, and, I guess it was, but not overall.
A lot of the time I think we actually spend in reality in the movie, when, from what I expected, I thought we were going to be in the mirror-world a lot more.
I was looking for fantasy, when I actually got magical realism. Not to mention that I actually thought the movie was quite depressing.
Not that I don't like magical realism, I just prefer fantasy more over it.
This movie also disappointing me on a lot of levels.
I had to watch it two times, let me explain.
The first time, I was so freaking confused. I think I movie is two hours long, and I was pissed off that I wasted my two hours just watching something when I didn't know what the heck was actually happening. And then, on the second watch, I made note to pay more attention, and it actually did make sense on the second watch.
The movie conveys a simple yet complicated idea.
A man makes a deal with the devil to be immortal, ONLY IF he hands any of his children that he may have to him once they turn sixteen. Then, once the immortal mans daughter turns sixteen, he suddenly realizes what a mistake he has made. The devil meets him once again and gives him a deal, first one to five souls wins.
The entire thing is kind of a game. There is this mirror, and inside of it is this whole other world inside of Doctor Parnassus's head, only one you can get into once he is in a trance.
These people step into this mirror, and, at the end, they must either go to the devil, or go with the good guys. If the person goes with the good guy, the good guys get a soul, if the person goes with the devil, the devil gets a soul.
See?
For me, it was hard to keep up with, yet it is a simple idea once you get the hang of it.
Honestly, even though this movie was nominated two times for an award, I don't think it is really worth your time.
I think the whole step through the mirror thing into Dr. Parnassus's head was cool, but it had so much more potential.
Like I said, I thought this movie was also pretty depressing. I can't really explain it, it just isn't the most lightest, most happiest movie you'll watch. I know I sound like I don't know what I am talking about, but I just thought it was overall pretty dark.
The movie is okay. I do recommend you watch it for the mirror stuff, but otherwise it is just a lot of filler and sad. Even the mirror-stuff had WAAAAAAY MORE POTENTIAL!
Instead, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECCOMEND you go watch Austenland. That was a happy movie that was more easier to follow and reached a big quantity of it's potential.
Good day! And God bless!"
866,4.0,"As an ""Alice"" purist I generally cringe at the assortment of attempts to adapt either of Lewis Carroll's works ""Alice in Wonderland"" and/or ""Through the Looking Glass"" to the movie screen.  These have been of varying quality but even the best are no more than satisfactory (""Dreamchild"" being an exception but it was more about the real Alice than about the Wonderland Alice).

But I had a pretty good idea what I was getting into before shelling out the bucks to see this Burton effort in 3-D.  I knew that despite what many have said and despite its title, this is not an adaptation of Carroll's books.  Accordingly I knew that this would greatly increase my toleration level.  They could do what they liked with the traditional characters and play around with whatever sort of plot elements intrigued them; I would not take particular offense.

That said I had no real problem with anything about the film.  In Burton and writer Linda Woolverton's story, Alice revisits Wonderland/The Looking Glass House 13 years after waking up from her original dreams.  Alice, now almost 20, is attending her sister's garden party, which she discovers is intended to be her engagement party.  Cringing at a marriage proposal from the unappealing son of her father's former business partner, she runs from the party and follows a white rabbit down an immense hole.

Her seemingly endless fall is arguably the best scene of the film and is by far the best Hollywood has ever assembled; even including a slick twist at the bottom where her hair is standing on end.  Then she repeats the drink-me eat-me shrinking-growing bit from the book.  And these two sequences are pretty much the only thing other than the characters that come directly out of the book.  One advantage of having a 20-year-old Alice is that her clothes do not shrink or grow with her size changes.  She must improvise on each occasion and this adds a touch of physical comedy to the transformations.

For her part Alice seems to have suppressed the memory of her two childhood dreams, showing little familiarity with the characters she is meeting for a second time (in some cases a third time).  And initially they are unsure that she is the same Alice who visited them over a decade earlier.  But for the white rabbit, the dormouse, the Tweedles, and the smoking caterpillar she has be the right Alice because they have lured her back to fulfill a prophecy.  It has been foretold that  Alice will slay the Jabberwocky (a dragon worthy of the lizards in the old 50's sci-fi films) with a magical sword.  This will change the balance of power, with the good White Queen getting the crown from the wicked Red Queen. We've seen this thing before, insert: ""Narnia, Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings"" here. And they throw in a few visuals from ""The Neverending Story"" series.

Ultimately Alice goes all ""Joan of Arc"" or at least ""Jane and the Dragon"" and becomes a knight in armor.  Many have lamented this action adventure turn of the story but the actual showdown takes only about 10 minutes so I don't think it is that big of a deal.  And it has some considerable basis as Alice had been the White Queen's Pawn (because the Queen's daughter Lily was too young to play) throughout the chess match in ""Through the Looking Glass"". That story was just one big chess game with a lengthy combat segment between the White Knight and the Red Knight, as well as a fight between the ""Gladstone"" Lion and the ""Disraeli"" Unicorn for the crown.  The only problem I see is that the combat is all too predictable.

Mia Waisikowska strikes a perfect balance as the title character, playing the bravest heroine in literary history requires a lot of nonverbal stuff and she sells her reluctance nicely along with giving her character a subtle sensual dimension.

Helena Bonham Carter pretty much steals the film, although she is upstaged on occasion by the grinning Cheshire cat.  Depp's Mad Hatter never quite comes into focus, playing the character as a schizophrenic (at least that's what I assume he was doing) introduced a little too much pain into this type of story; in much the same way that his take on Willy Wonka just brought the viewer down.  A run-of-the-mill lunatic would worked better.

As the White Queen, Anne Hathaway was pretty much irrelevant and was most likely cast because of her ""small"" head (her features seem to take up her entire face-especially with the extreme make-up),  a kind of good-guy bad-guy balance for her evil sister's big head.  But I did like the off-kilter Morticia Addams take she gave her character; rather than playing her as a goody-two-shoes.

The audience during my showing was attentive and entertained from beginning to end (well almost to the end as the film goes out on a couple of extremely weak scenes back on the surface).  But most bolted before the closing credits, which played over Avril Lavigne singing ""Alice"" (Avril also appears in the film's trailer).  Given that it is mostly up-scale theaters with state-of-the-art sound systems showing this film, those who left missed one of the best moments of the whole viewing experience.  Not unlike those who missed the great closing credits animation sequences at the end of ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.

Trippin out

 Get back on my feet, on the ground
Is this real?
Is this pretend?
I'll take a stand until the end

875,1.0,"The first three Saw film weren't bad. They weren't exactly classics, but they weren't bad. After the third ended and Jigsaw died, apparently someone decided to really go for something and continue the whole Saw series anyway. What we get is a disastrous hodgepodge of bizarre plot twists, ridiculous new characters, poorly designed ""traps"" that come nowhere near as entertaining as the earlier ones, and worst of all, they try to add depth to John, also known as Jigsaw.

Look, Jigsaw was never scary. Ever. Nor was he profound in any way. He was even less scary with that totally ridiculous clown mask, and even more comical with the pig mask. If those were genuinely meant to be frightening, they had the exact opposite effect. The laughing doll on the tricycle was beyond stupid, and John's antihero motives were, to put it in a word, absurd. The writers continued to run with John somehow being deep or intelligent or somehow unique and worth following, and they failed so miserably that V makes sure not to make up for the catastrophic failure that was IV.

So, here we are again. If IV wasn't bad enough with the flashbacks and completely unnecessary backstory behind Jigsaw and some other characters that we could not care less about, V amps it up. Now we get more about his wife, the detectives, some more random flesh to blow up, and, worst of all, an attempt at adding meaning to the story, which turned into a dismal failure that grated on everyone's nerves. No one ever cared in the slightest about John, anything about him, his ""antivillain"" persona, or anyone related to him in any way. We simply do not care, and none of the Saw films after III succeeded in what they tried to do, which was to add depth to an already-ridiculous story. John still comes off as an insensible weirdo, everything is still mind-numbingly implausible, the ""twists"" are completely meaningless (especially for a series in which we never cared in the slightest about the story and just wanted to see the goddamned traps--this is a horror film, not a thriller, despite its best efforts), and nothing really changes. In-between trap scenes, we get all these flashbacks of the past Saw films with more context added. Why? Really, why? Who watched these films and thought the story had any potential to be something to be taken seriously? One person? No one?

V doesn't learn one bit from its mistakes with IV, and continues to run with the story, despite the fact that Jigsaw is dead, but somehow not dead, and also somehow has accomplices now. Really, the writers just had to come up with *something*, so this is the end result, but come on. I never watched another Saw film after this one, just because I knew I was going to get more of the same childish nonsense that takes itself seriously in-between terribly lame and boring traps. Backstory's the name of the game in V, and the fact still remains that it's boring, stupid, shallow, and Jigsaw is just not interesting, scary, profound, or in any way notable--just his traps. John is actually quite grating with his constant monologues of ""rehabilitating"" people with his traps, claiming not to be murderer, but do any of us believe for a second that his motives are what we care about? Why would anyone care? He's just some guy with a warped philosophy of how to ""rehabilitate"" criminals, drug dealers, rapists, or otherwise morally questionable people.

We. Do. Not. Care. Not about John, not about his wife, not about a single character that has ever existed in Saw who we're just assumed to care about. No one does. Why should we? The film doesn't bother with that part--the fact that they're connected to Jigsaw is apparently good enough. Well, no, it isn't, actually. Jigsaw is a ridiculous villain, a boring serial killer with childish ideas of morality, a completely not-scary persona, and that same mask he's been using since the beginning which has never once instilled the slightest fear in anyone who's at all familiar with well-designed horror villains. Even Freddy Krueger, through nearly ten Nightmare on Elm Street films, didn't bother that much with his backstory, because his backstory was never important. We just wanted to see him kill people in the dreams he created for them. That's it. The same goes for Jigsaw--we just want to see the traps. We don't care about who's doing it, because that's a moot point unless it's something really, really special. John is not special. He's boring and stupid. Just get to the freaking traps.

If IV wasn't bad enough, V just ignores everything that was wrong with it and keeps going with the insensible story and its trademark deep green color that seem to glow on every single object there is. It's not scary or suspenseful in any way, and V is the most boring one I've seen, as well as the most insulting, since I never got past this one, doubting they could make up for this new direction they were going in just for the sake of continuing the series.

Saw V fails on every single count. It's not as gory as the previous installments, the traps are boring, the characters are boring, the entire story is boring, the ""twists"" are beyond stupid and also meaningless, and the film tries the whole time to be something it can never be, as something intellectual on some level. We're supposed to feel something for John for some reason, despite that he's just not interesting, and, you know, we already saw him die once after the trilogy ended. Where do you go after that? Well, this film thinks the best course of action is to just add a lot of meaningless details in a mindless effort to allow for a new one next year. Terrible on any standard, and a yawn-inducing horror film, and a film that's meant to keep you on the edge of your seat that instead just keeps you checking your watch wondering when it's going to end definitely has a problem. Well, here you go, the continuation of the downward spiral of Saw's ability to entertain even shock-horror fans. Having never seen the sequels past this one, I can only imagine how those went, but V has officially stopped my involvement in a franchise that should have never continued past III.

Just disastrous."
876,4.0,"'Bout freaking time Wo-Wo got her own gig! After three other made-for-video animated movies, DC Universe put together the first origin story involving one of their Big 3, Wonder Woman, which is great since Josh ""Whedonverse"" Whedon dropped the ball on the whole live-action film deal. Unlike Superman: Doomsday, Justice League: New Frontier, and Batman: Gotham Knight, this one isn't continuing from an already established storyline. It takes the original premise of Wonder Woman from the 40s, and resets it for the 21st Century.

A few thousand years ago, the Amazons were under the subjection of Ares, the Greek god of war. Queen Hippolyta leads her sister-warriors in a battle to liberate themselves from Ares, and their bastard son, who like all good mothers, Hippolyta beheads. The Amazons are freed, and allowed to live on a secluded island called Themyscara(aka: Paradise Island), but must keep watch over the now less than powerful Ares who they keep imprisioned. Shoot ahead to modern day where skirtchasing pilot Steve Trevor crashlands on the island and is taken in by Diana, the daughter of Hippolyta brought to life from clay. The Amazons determine that Steve is not a theat, and hold a tournament to see who would be the one to take him back home. Diana disguises herself as a common warrior, and wins. But, its discovered that Ares seduced his jailer Persephone, and the two of them made their escape off the island. Diana now has to deliver Steve back to America, but at the same time find Ares. Once back in the States, Steve offers to help Diana. After a few drinks, they are attacked by a demigod working for Ares. Diana stops him, and learns that Ares is at an ancient temple leading to Tartarus. Diana and Steve fight Ares and Persephone in the temple, but are unable to stop them from entering the underworld, where Ares gets his uncle Hades to restore his godly powers. Steve takes the injured Diana to a hospital, where they explore their feelings. Ares then leads an assault on Washington D.C. with an army of monsters. Diana rushes to stop him, but is outnumbered. Fortunately, the Amazons arrive, and go all 300 on Ares' forces. Not even the combined might of zombie Amazons, and Ares' now more empowered strength stops Diana and the others from defeating him. Diana returns with others to Themyscara, but Hippolyta realizes that the Amazons should continue to learn more about the ""world of man"", and appoints Diana as their emissary. Diana now goes incognito as a regular American citizen with Steve knowing her true identity, which is now dubbed Wonder Woman. The film ends with her taking on the supervillainess, Cheetah.

This was actually one of the better DC Universe selections. The animation was truly exceptional from the first two American-animated movies(Batman: Gotham Knight was all anime), and the story moved along really well. The only real downside was that alot was cut out for the sake of meeting Warner's 75 minute time limit. I dunno why, but all their OVAs have to be no more than 75 minutes, maybe to fit into a 90 minute airtime on Cartoon Network or something. Because of this though, there's quite a few corners that get shaved, like no explanation of where the technology for the invisible jet came from or how Diana even knows how to pilot it, and how a powerless Ares made it off Themyscara and all the way to Cuba with no boat or anything.

The voice acting was pretty fair too, especially Nathan ""Captain Hammer"" Fillion as Steve Trevor. The character designs were also good. I liked the fact that they went back and made Hippolyta a brunette unlike on Justice League and the original Wonder Woman TV series where she was always blonde. Ares seems like a villain from a Yoshiaki Kawajiri animated film. Artemis looks pretty buff, like she usually does in the comics. Diana appears to be alot taller and athletic than in most other animated incarnations of her. Aside from the colossal design she had in Justice League: New Frontier, this version has her as a real warrior type, and not just a buxom chick in a swimsuit.

Aside from the short runtime on it, Wonder Woman is a very satisfying superhero movie, animated or otherwise. The whole focus on this was mainly on Wonder Woman's mythological ties, and since she's a myth-based hero like Thor, Hercules, and Captain Marvel, at least most of the plots she's involved with are about gods and demons. Since this movie got most of that taken care of, if they end up doing some kind of contuation from it in say Wonder Woman 2, they'll hopefully be able to focus a little more on the actual superhero side of the character. Definately want to see Wo-Wo take on Villainy Inc.!"
877,5.0,"DBZ freaking rocks! This blu-ray is fantastic. This also has the classic American Soundtrack which aired when it ran on Toonami, which is the one I actually liked. I tried the other audio track, and it just sounded straight-up out of place."
878,5.0,"After being let down so much with movies lately, THIS ONE BLEW ME AWAY!!!  Start to finish Non-Stop ULTRA Intense Suspense and Horror in the most vile form.  Movies RARELY affect me as much as this one and I'm crying even as I now write this.  It is extremely difficult to watch at times and I don't know how many times I was yelling at the screen, getting so F'ing pissed.  This had me totally freaking out.  This is hard core depravity with some of the finest acting I have ever seen.  This ENTIRE FILM FAR SURPASSES PRETTY MUCH ANY MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN.  POWERFUL.  INCREDIBLE.  AND SADLY, BELIEVABLE."
879,3.0,"I was recommended this movie along with ""Inside"" I watched Inside first. It was stupid. So my expectations for this one was not too high. I have to say. I' glad they proved me wrong. This movie, unlike Inside, actually has a plot. It's about a girl named Lucie who was being tortured and she escaped. She was then place into an orphanage where she meets Anna and the two become best friends (with one wanting more). years later Lucie tracks down the people responsible and well, things doesn't end too happy for them.

I won't spoil much but the movie was very good, the acting was top notch. The pacing was good. It kept us interested for a long time. No one was falling asleep on this one.

However, this movie does suffer its problems. It makes characters do stupid things to push the plot along. For example, One girl wanted to hurry up and leave the house, yet after certain events she just lingers and lingers and lingers because the plot needs her to stay.

The last maybe 30 mins of the movie was a nightmare, but not the good or scary kind. it was boring as hell and went on for far too long. We didn't need it, it was pointless, it was trying to make a statement that was stupid. It's like I was watching a bunch of filler crap. And honestly, the whole ""it's an organization"" plot shock isn't much of a shock when the reason behind this ""organization"" is retarded. it's like the last 30 mins tried to be Hostel but was too afraid to just take the idea so they had to come up with their own excuse for this organization which was not nearly as good or even well thought out as Hostel. We were all sitting there going ""Really? That's what this is about?"" Honestly, before the last 30 minutes I was ready to give it five stars but those last minutes that dragged on and freaking on with pretentious religious babble and torture was mind numbing. The person who recommended this movie claimed people walked out the screening cause they were so affected by what they saw but honestly I think they walked out ont he last 30 mins of this movie cause it freaking sucked."
880,3.0,"""It will polarize audiences!"" scream the reviews.  ""Brilliant!"" say some.  ""Grotesquely bad!"" moan others.  It's been called shocking, relevatory, revolutionary, unsettling, profound, and even genius.

Let's not get carried away.

First of all, unless you yourself are a mass murderer or life-hardened torturer, this movie WILL probably bother you.  That is, without question, one of its goals.  The film excutes a little soft-shoe at the end to make you believe that goal is secondary -- to convince you that the movie (and its heroes and villains) had a higher purpose -- but I'm not sold.  Not at all.  I'll get to that.  In the meantime: be prepared for some gut-churning violence.  Lots and lots of it.  So much so that, yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is gratuitous.

I'm going to harp on this for a bit.  I've read many, many reviews that argue that the film is in no way gratuitous, that the overwhelming amount and quality of the violence is in service of a greater point.  These people are, at best, unaware of what the word ""gratuitous"" means.  At worst, they are willfully and gleefully unaware of the film's point.

IF the film's goal were simply to horrify and unsettle, then the violence is by no means gratuitous.  ""Let's make people puke!"" the director could've announced.  ""Let's cause them to choke up bile into their sinuses!""  IF he'd said this, then the violence would've fit the film to a T.  Children being beaten and flayed.  Various implements hard bolted into bones.  Knives, shotguns and hammers.

This is not the film's goal, however.  The first half of the film shows us a young child escaping from some kind of torture chamber and undergoing extensive recuperation, during which she befriends another girl.  Fifteen years later, the two girls set off on a quest of vengeance, which doesn't take that long, really.  Up to this point, most viewers will be excited to know what happens next, will be intrigued and (if not slightly sickened) happily disgusted.

Then the film spirals into a philosophical black hole.  The story suddenly veers away from the (so far) compelling revenge plot and enters a world of weird and wealthy people who have sinister and stupid goals.  I wish I could go into it, but I don't want to give anything away.  I'll just say this:

Most people struggle, at their most basic, with one question: what's the point?  People find the ""point"" in lots of ways, but throughout human history, the most popular explanations have had to do with the world outside of the human realm.  With that ""sleep"" that Hamlet was so uncertain about (""perchance to dream?"").  People have used lots of things to legitimize or discredit or dis/prove the purposefulness of the human experience: drugs, war, religion, meditation, and logic.  This film is, basically, about a, shall we say, unique way of discerning the validity of the human experience.

Does that sound pompous or self-indulgent?  That's because it is.  Especially the way this film goes about it.  Hence the gratuity.  Needless to say, this film demonstrates a rather macabre way of sussing out the existence of a Higher Purpose.  As soon as it becomes clear where the film is headed, as soon as the film reveals the bunny in its hat, the magic trick is over.  And yet this movie goes on for about fifteen more minutes, showing the same violence, the same torture, the same ridiculous excess.  It is, in effect, trying to make martyrs out of the audience's sensibilities.  Understandable, but not clever.  It's like the child who does the old ""knock knock"" joke that involves the following exchange dozens of times:

Child: Knock, knock.
You: Who's there?
Child: Banana.
You: Banana who?
Child: Knock, knock.

This goes on and on, with you checking your watch and indulging the child.  Finally, the kid says, ""Orange.""  ""Orange who?"" you respond.  The punchline?  ""Orange you glad I didn't say banana?""

Ah, it's punny.  There's an element of wit to it.  But it's freaking annoying.  Gratuitous.  This film is that joke, but it's not funny, and although its final line has the same spirit of word play and snarkiness to it as ""Orange you glad I didn't say banana?"" it is nowhere near as decisive or illuminating.  Instead, this film plays off obfuscation as if it were the same thing as brilliance.  That's not bad all by its lonesome -- other films have done the same thing with far greater pinache and beauty -- but coming at the tail end of so much nauseating wickedness and hell, it's very much a cop-out.  It's as if the filmmaker couldn't conceive of any straight-forward way to justify the movie he just made, and so he aborts the whole thing with an incoherent mumble.

Five stars for the first half.  Zero stars for the last half.  I recommend you stop the movie at about the forty minute mark.  (After the ""monster"" is dealt with once and for all.)  You'll have watched an artfully filmed and coherent vignette of a film.  Everything past that is worthless."
881,1.0,"But it is to freaking long.  At 94 minutes this movie is exactly 93 minutes and 59 seconds to long.  I mean walking in the Hallway, walk walk walk walk.  Then walk some more.  See zombie, vampire thingy and run run run.  Avoid thingy then walk walk walk.  Repeat this for the 93 minutes.  Oh, lets throw in 59 seconds of fighting and call it a day.  Bad, bad bad.  I really tried to watch it but at about 45 minutes into the movie you will go into the kitchen, grab a spoon and take your eyes out.  I almost did and the only thing that stopped me was the movie is so forgettable that I forgot what I was doing half way to the kitchen and went to use my computer.  When I got up again I saw this zombie movie on tv and watched a few moments of it before watching something else."

883,4.0,"Why does Amazon cross post these reviews?  I don't want to read about the DVD version under the blu-ray title.

What can one say about this video?  It's Jeff freaking Beck.  When is the last time you saw a JB video?  Never.  At 64, the guy comes out of his shell, get's inducted into the RNR Hall of Fame, goes on tour and does a full length video.

This show was taped at Ronnie Scotts in London where JB played for a week.  As far as I can tell, the video is all from the same night.  The band is tight.  I could do without the two guest singers although People Get Ready is a great song.  The songs off of Blow By Blow and Wired are what I came for and the rest to me is filler.  One star off.  I think Tal, the almost jailbait bassist is good but a little gimicky.  She seems to get lost on Space Boogie.  Eric Clapton makes an appearance on a couple tracks and the bonus material is a rock a billy set with the something or other playboys.

I was really excited about this video and watched it straight thru on back to back nights.  Jeff Beck is one of the guitar gods.  It's great to see him (live) looking almost the same as he did 30 years ago.  Still has the same hair style and guitar chops.  Never realised before how much he uses his whammy bar to make the sounds he does.  Would like to have seen more just straight ahead playing but that is not jeff's style.  He would be bored and boring just playing the guitar.

Good BD picture quality but not the best I have seen.  Jazz Legends just sets the bar for BD PQ and this is full star below that.  The sound is pretty incredible and I have yet to detect a studio over dub but still may have been polished up a bit in post production.  Great sound and 5 stars for that.  I don't think the DVD would come close with it's lossy compression.

Eagle Rock, give us more Jeff Beck on DVD or BD, please!"
884,5.0,"Gurren Lagann is one of the best anime titles out there. It's art style is what sets it apart from all the rest. This crazy hand drawn style (though I'm not entirely sure if it is hand drawn) may turn off some, but I personally dig it. I knew what to expect after buying Dead Leaves. This is a bit more tame (story wise) compared to Dead Leaves, but still off the chain none the less. The story line is great. There is a little over the top acting at times but that is kinda like the soul of this series. The whole freaking crew is over the top! And I love that about it!
This is the final two volumes packaged as Part 3. It was worth every dollar spent, and I highly recommend it!

They now have the complete series for a cheaper price."
885,5.0,"Sebastian is freaking AWESOME!!!  I first saw him on the Vince Vaugh Wild West Comedy Show...thought i would give this DVD a try...sooooo glad i did.  He did NOT disappoint and it's definitely one we will watch over and over.  Seriously, we were laughing so hard i was crying."
886,5.0,"Bolt believes he is the character from his TV show because the producers think this makes him the most emotion filled and believable animal actor ever seen. Penny, his person, and the heroine from the show wants Bolt to be able to be a real dog and come home with her for the weekend. The money grubbing agent of course will have nothing to do with that idea.

The network says that research shows Bolt is too predictable and is boring people in their target age group. Penny gets in trouble and Bolt always saves her. So they put in a twist, Penny gets in trouble and Bolt doesn't save her. After the show Penny is panicked because they won't let her see Bolt, and she knows he's going to be freaking out thinking she is in trouble, which of course he is. He gets out of his trailer, hits his head trying to escape the building and is knocked unconscious into a box of pink Styrofoam and gets shipped to New York.

When he wakes up, he is searching for Penny, and doesn't know he's not on the set and doesn't have super powers. The contrast of his belief he is a superhero with real life sets up lots of funny scenes throughout the movie. He meets some pigeons, which is a reoccurring theme in the movie. The pigeons always have a pronounced accent and clear local sayings and behaviors that are quite funny. These pigeons introduce him to a jaded cat named Mittens that Bold believes works for the villain from the TV show. She explains to him that he has to get from New York to California to find Penny. Against her wishes they set off across country to find Penny.

They pick up a funny hamster in a ball on the way named Rhino. He's a huge fan of Bolt's TV show and that is how Mittens, and eventually Bolt figure out that he's not truly a superhero. There are so many funny scenes that it may be in the Disney humor realm with the greats like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Toy-Story-10th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0009MAO46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsters-Inc-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JKDR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsters, Inc.

I'll need to see it a few more times to know for sure, but it's at least close.

There are of course several tear jerking scenes as Bolt discovers he is just a dog, the truth about Mittens and when he thinks Penny doesn't really love him. But in true Disney fashion, he rises above his limitations and is more than he knows. The ending is great, and the pigeons make a final appearance indicating what part of the country they're in.

This is a movie I preordered because I will enjoy it as much as my children, and when they watch it every day in the car for two weeks, I'll laugh at the lines right along with them."
887,3.0,"Perkins 14 is basically another zombie movie.  Alright so technically the wild people roaming the streets aren't zombies in the true sense, so let's just call them enhanced ultra relentless zombies.  You see it's about these people that were trapped underground for 10 years and drugged to be super powerful, and when released they appear with a vengeance against all the normal people around town.  It's about a father, mother and daughter that do whatever it takes to escape and survive.  One of the zombies in particular is the oldest son.  He was lost for 10 years, assumed dead but he's actually still alive and more aggressive than ever.  What will happen when the family comes across their son one evening?  You'll have to see for yourself but let it be known the ending is really good.  Best part of the movie.

The problem here is that we're not seeing anything particularly new in the zombie genre.  This is all run of the mill stuff.  Some of the acting is pretty bad as well.  The mother spends her entire time freaking out and overexaggerating, the daughter is a dirty little... and the father sporting his Raul Ibanez look (Yankees/Mariners/Phillies baseball player) is one of the highlights being an ""always ready for anything"" police officer, in addition to being pretty intelligent and focused.  The biggest problem is that the man responsible for creating these abnormal beings gets written out of the storyline fairly early and it's a shame since he's clearly the most enticing character in the movie given his unpredictable and offbeat persona.  What a waste of potential.  Not a bad movie though, hence the 3-star rating.  It could have been more."
888,5.0,"ENTERTAINMENT!  I was dragged to this movie by my girlfriend who always attends the guy films and so I went to see this ""chick flick"", which was my understanding. I think this was a true love story and one of possibilities, one of hope. I saw this movie and was entertained. I give this movie 5 stars and truly understand why it won 8 Academy Awards, it didn't have that Hollywood feeling. Even though the whole story was fake, it made me wish that at least some parts were real and isn't that what movies are supposed to do?
This movie made me, laugh, winch, cringe, cheer, jump, laugh some more and finally... DANCE! This was a great freaking movie! 5 Stars!"

890,2.0,"Poor Casey (Odette Yustman Annable; And Soon the Darkness, ""October Road"") is having a rough week. Not only is she having strange dreams about her crazy, suicide mom but her nightmares are being invaded by visions of a demonic, long dead little boy. The creepy little boy she babysits is adding an extra dose of the creepy as well as knocking her upside the head with little mirrors while spouting off bad horror movie dialogue. And what's with all the strange knockings emanating from her bathroom mirror? And who owns that feroucious dog with the upside down head? And can someone call the exterminator to get rid of all the bugs that keep falling out of her eggs and crawling across her term papers? And who is Jumby?

Her friends are no help. Her dimwitted boyfriend Mark (Cam Gigandet; Twilight, Priest) would rather lay around in his tightie whities and express deep philosophical insights about how vast the universe is (hey, he may be pretty but he's no Himbo!) than offer any support to her. Her BFF Romy (Meagan Good; Saw 5, Eve's Bayou), who is suppose to be some sort of supernatural expert, is ready to have her commited. And her father is conviently out of town an no one has bothered to call him to let him know that his princess is in a desperate battle for her life and soul against a very powerful dybic (or a Hebrew demon).

But luckily for Casey she has her Grandma Sophia (Jane Alexander) on her side. Oh, wait, Grandma Sophia has been disposed of permanently by some double and triple jointed old guy in the home who can contort his body at wild angles and walk like a spider. So that leaves Rabi Sendak (Gary Oldman; Bram Stoker's Dracula, Romeo Is Bleeding) to connect with his inner Merrin and wage war against the dybic before it achieves it's ultimate goal of destroying Casey and being born into our world.

While it does sport so very impressive and, at times, very frightening visuals, it just can't erase the simple truth that this movie is boring. It's just one cliche scene after the other. So much do that it took me three sittings just to get through it. Yes I admit the upside down headed dog was impressive...the first one or two times. By the sixth and seventh sighting, I was ready to throw Cerberus a rawhide bone just to give it something more interesting to do besides snarl. The cast (aside from Gigandet who couldn't act his way convincingly through a Christmas play) does their best to lead us through this mess but even they appear to not fully know where the story is going. In one scene, after witnessing the death and reanimated possession of one of their friends, Casey, Mark, and Rabi Sendak appear in the very next scene at an all night diner acting as if nothing out of the ordinary had just happened. I, for one, would be freaking out and high tailing it to the first synagogue I found. Scenes like this play out all through the movie. The little boy tells Casey that ""Jumby wants to be born now."". A few minutes later, Mr. Casey's Dad tells her that she had a twin who died in utero and that his nickname was, wait for it, Jumby (dun dun DUNNN! Quite a twist, huh? Betcha you didn't see this little tidbit of info coming!).

While they had a chance to pull off a fairly good idea, the execution of it is poor. The whole Jewish folklore surrounding the dybic demon sounds incredibly interesting and scary, in the end the producers opt for cheap thrills and jump scares. If Jumby really wants to born now, surely he would've picked a better script to be born through instead of this one. I'm giving it two stars for a few reasons: One for the visuals and for introducing us to the Dybic and a Jewish exorcism and Two just for the fact that Odette Annable looks really hot in her underwear that she models a lot through this movie."
891,5.0,The best freaking movie!
892,2.0,"And removed all the sex, friendship, and fun, this is what would be left. Basically it's just a gorgeous girl who has an orgy with labels and credit cards. So why did I give this two stars instead of one? Simply put, Isla Fisher is freaking gorgeous (how Borat got her is beyond me). She easily beats Amy Adams as the hottest redhead in Hollywood (no meagre feat, I might add), and quite frankly, she is so beautiful to watch that I can almost look past the nonexistent script and cardboard performances. Almost. Even with such eyecandy I still want a decent story (I'm not asking for ""Citizen Kane"" here people. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" had amazing actors, a great storyline, and gorgeous scenery and wasn't too far away from the concept being presented here but was light years beyond it in presentation). Chick-lit can be witty and interesting, and it's an insult to women to present subpar stories and expect them to eat it up simply because Hollywood believe that it has figured out the female genome for viewing. It's like all of those stupid ""Van Wilder"" films which are supposed to appeal to men because drinking, partying, goofy off, and hot chicks are presented. Writers need to not be so lazy and actually come up with real thoughtout concepts instead of tired films based on beer and mall ads.
  Okay, the story: beautiful Isla is deeply in debt, living with an equally broke roommate who looks exactly like Katy Perry, comes from an overly frugal family which is why she overcompensates with constant shopping, and now finds herself out of a job. She dreams of working at the top fashion magazine in NYC (really, doesn't Hollywood believe that women have any other hopes and dreams beyond writing about insanely priced clothing made by gay designers who insist that every woman look like a 12 year old boy? I have to ask), and is on her way to interview when she is (literally) seduced by a scarf. Her cards are maxed out and she seeks extra cash at the local hot dog stand where she runs into a British hottie. She tells him a lie about her sick aunt needing the scarf and he generously gives her the money and a bit of a lecture about the worth of things. Long story short, she buys the scarf and goes to the interview where, lo and beyond, the fashion position is taken but a spot in the financial sister mag is open (oh what irony!). What is our girl to do? Of course she goes to the interview where guess who is her prospective boss but generous Brit! She tries to b.s. her way through, but obviously fails. Upset, she stays up all night drinking with her roommate and writes two letters, one to the fashion mag trying to show how bright she is and the other to our beloved Brit telling him what a twit he was. I wouldn't tell you what happens, but you can probably guess or else the film would end here.
 Along the way our lovely Isla finds herself in almost cartoon-esque situations and slowly but surely discovers what is truly valuable in life. One of the most improbable things for me about this movie was the triangle between Isla, the Brit, and some bland blonde chick who worked for the fashion mag. I'm sorry, but given the choice between gorgeous and irresistable Isla and some lifeless stick figure, is there even a debate? I never felt as if the blonde had any chance (then again, who would against Isla? Have I mentioned how beautiful she is?). I thought perhaps I wasn't the target audience so I watched this with my stepdaughter and niece and they both weren't too crazy about this film either. Script writers need to leave the ""Sex and the City"" concept alone. It worked great for that programme, but that was lightening in the bottle. The magic will not be recaptured no matter how many gorgeous women they show walking and shopping in designer stores up and down the streets of New York. I'm hoping that the antimateralistic message will catch on in these trying economic times, but I suspect that all this film will inspire is for more women to go to their local salons in an attempt to achieve Ms. Fisher's glorious mane. Decent effort but it sadly fell flat."
893,5.0,The picture quality is great with all 3 movies with Tokyo Drift being the best looking.  The audio is freaking outstanding on all 3 movies.  I listen to these movies with my audio dial about half way of what I normally use for other movies and its louder than all of them.

Spoiler Alert for horror fans!  You watch this expecting a horror film you have spoiled two hours of your life.

This is not a horror film.  It is not shocking in any sense.  There was blood twice and even then it looked fake in the leg scene.  If your expectations are a artsy film this may be for you.  If you are looking for the promised horror it markets then ugh...  Go watch Martyrs.  It is still the vanguard for horror brutality and yet retains than 'artsy' feel. (August Underground, Scrapbook, Murder Set Pieces all fall into a different category).

I will say the film is beautifully shot and the dialogue is interesting but its just so freaking boring.  Between this and Let the Right One in you have the perfect cure for insomnia."

--------------------------------------------------

(This review was written on April 6, 2009, the day after the live Wrestlemania 25 event took place.)

I have been a WWE fan for over 25 years.  I've seen every Wrestlemania, been to three of them ""live"" (via closed circuit television in the arena in the late 1980s - before pay-per-view existed), and have ordered every single one on pay-per-view for the past 15 years.  I have enjoyed each and every one that I've seen...until last night's 25th event.

For starters, it annoys me to no end that WWE kept promoting the event as the 25th anniversary.  It was the 24th anniversary, not the 25th.  The first Wrestlemania took place 24 years ago in 1985, not 25 years ago in 1984.  Putting that aside, going into the event it looked like it was going to be a great show.  The first sign of trouble was the night before Wrestlemania at the Hall of Fame ceremony.  The televised portion of the ceremony was like one big ad for the  Wrestlemania event and the Legends of Wrestlemania video game.  WWE even had Jerry Lawler stop the awards show to present a clip from the game featuring Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker.  This is supposed to be a prestigious event, not another opportunity to shill WWE's wares.

While I'm on the subject of the Hall of Fame ceremony, WWE needs to start showing the entire ceremony live and unedited on television, like the Academy Awards and every other major awards show does every year.  There's no need to show part of it live online and tape the rest, only to show it edited a few hours later on television.  It's not like the USA Network has anything more important to show.  All they played last Saturday night were 5-10 year old movies that they've shown numerous times before.

Anyway, getting back to Wrestlemania 25...Things started off fairly well.  Although I thought Nicole Scherzinger's performance of ""America The Beautiful"" was rather lackluster, it served its purpose nicely and was well done overall.  The Money in the Bank ladder match was also very enjoyable, even though Christian should have been awarded the prize instead of C.M. Punk.

Then came the first of the event's many downfalls: Kid Rock.  What the heck was he doing there?  Nobody goes to Wrestlemania to see Kid Rock.  If, like Motorhead or POD, he was there to perform a superstar's theme music, that would be fine.  Instead he performed a 10-minute medley of his ""greatest hits"", concluding with his latest single - which an on-screen graphic was kind enough to let us know is available on his latest album.  Geez, even the video game shilling on the Hall of Fame ceremony the night before wasn't this much of a time waster.

Kid Rock segued right into the event's second downfall: the 25 ""woman"" Diva Battle Royal to crown the first ever Miss Wrestlemania.  It started off bad, continued to be bad, and ended bad.  Why weren't any of the Divas given introductions so we'd know who they all are?  Yes, I know WWE were trying to hide the fact that they had a man in drag (Santino Marella) in the match, but why bring back all these women from years past and give them absolutely no attention whatsoever?  Sunny was in the match, but there was hardly a mention of her, and she was only fleetingly seen on screen.  The same for the other past Divas - Molly Holly, Jackie Gayda, Joy Giovanni, and Torrie Wilson - some of whom were only mentioned when they went sailing over the top rope.  Victoria was the only past Diva who got any bit of screen time, and it was just a brief few seconds.  Having no introductions also hurts the current Divas, as it gives them no way to stand out from each other.  Looking at all 25 women in the ring, without knowing who is who, it ends up being just a sea of generic blondes and brunettes.

It's absolutely ridiculous that the women, some of whom can really work, were given one worthless spot on the card, and a man in drag walks away with the victory.  That says a lot about what WWE thinks of its women's division.  But WWE didn't just insult the Divas, WWE also insulted the audience by NOT having ""Santina"" be revealed to be a man in drag.  The fact that WWE had neither the women in the ring NOR the commentators notice that there was a man in there was absolutely moronic.  It was completely obvious to anyone watching, yet the announcers (of course) didn't notice that he was even there until the match was almost over, and none of the Divas even touched or attacked him throughout the match.  After he tossed out his girlfriend Beth Phoenix, why not have her go back into the ring and pull his wig off, and then kick his butt?  That would have been a somewhat respectable way to salvage this debacle.  Instead WWE continued on as if ""Santina"" were a real woman.  This match was clearly the Wrestlecrap Match of the Night.  That's not something WWE should be proud of.

The Chris Jericho vs. the Legends match started and ended with great disappointment.  Roddy Piper was good, Jimmy Snuka was sad to see (he can hardly walk), but once Ricky Steamboat and Jericho were left to go at it one-on-one it was AMAZING!  That part of the match was one of the few highlights of the whole night.  Then it got really disappointing.  Much ado was made of Ric Flair and Mickey Rourke, but they did little to nothing to affect the match.  A run in or some interference during the match would be been appropriate (Flair briefly ran in and was quickly taken care of so that negated his presence at ringside).

After the match was over, THEN Rourke is brought into the spotlight, having been called out by Jericho.  After an eternity of making his way into the ring, Rourke gets in two punches and Jericho is left holding his head.  I know that the WWE likes to put celebrities over at Wrestlemania, but that just looked bad for both Jericho AND Rourke, and it was so anti-climatic for the audience.  I suppose, looking back, there wasn't much more that he could have done, but WWE could have handled it with more excitement than THAT.  Flair and Rourke might as well not have bothered to show up since they did nothing of importance.

The Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy match was another one of the event's highlights, so there's really nothing bad to say about it.  Well, other than the fact that for an ""Extreme Rules"" match, there sure was a distinct lack of blood (save for a small cut on Matt's head).

The Rey Mysterio vs. John Bradshaw Layfield match was barely that.  From bell to bell it ran a mere 21 seconds.  The match was a disgrace to all the great Intercontinental matches in Wrestlemania history.  I didn't pay almost sixty dollars to see an event with a match that didn't even last half a minute - especially when both wrestlers are capable of putting on an enjoyable and much longer match.

Next up was the Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker match.  An absolute classic that was damn near perfect.  If anything it could have been a tiny bit shorter - there were too many near falls for my liking - but that's a very minor quibble.  This was the last match of the night for which I truly felt like I was getting *some* of my money's worth.

The first title match of the televised event was next, and it's the Triple Threat featuring John Cena vs. Edge vs. Big Show for the World Heavyweight Championship.  I'd ask why there needs to be a Triple Threat at every Wrestlemania, but that's irrelevant.  The whole match just felt like The John Cena Show to me.  It was lame and predictable.  WWE even had the same exact spot in the match that they had on free TV a few weeks ago: Vickie Guerrero on the ring apron, Cena runs at her but stops, steps aside, and Edge spears her off the apron.  The Big Show never won a singles title at Wrestlemania.  He's long overdue.  Instead WWE gives us the same old, same old.  Yawn.

The Hall of Fame Class of 2009 come out next and get the bows they deserve.  Stone Cold Steve Austin then drives around the ring in his ATV and has a farewell beer bash.  This was all well and good, but the fact that Kid Rock got more screen time than the Hall of Fame class is complete BS.

Then we have the final match of the evening: Randy Orton vs. Triple H for the WWE Championship.  I was actually looking forward to this match because their feud was intense, and it could have been a big payoff.  But WWE ruined it by getting awfully strict with the rules.  When you have a feud where both men attacked each other in the most vicious and brutal ways, and each one of them is just waiting to get his hands around the throat of the other, you don't set up a match where the rules of disqualification are stricter than ever.  Because of that, there was no twist, no interference (by either Legacy or the McMahons), no nothing.  It was lame, tame, and ordinary.  The build up was better than the match.  Besides that, it had NOTHING to do with the title. This was a personal grudge match, not a championship match, not a pay-per-view main event, and sure as heck not a Wrestlemania main event, let alone the main event of this big landmark ""25th anniversary"" Wrestlemania. THIS is the match that should have had Extreme Rules, THIS is the match where they should have been beating the ever loving crap out of each other.

Wait a minute!  That was the last match?  When I ordered the event, one of the matches I was most looking forward to was the Champions vs. Champions Tag Team Title Match featuring Carlito & Primo vs. Miz & Morrison.  But where is it?  As I would find out the next day on WWE.com, the match did indeed take place at Wrestlemania - just not as part of the televised event.  WWE shunted the match to the non-televised pre-show.  A match for the freaking Tag Team TITLES was not worthy of being shown on television?  It was not only a title match, but one in which the titles would be UNIFIED! Surely that's something important? Surely that's worth showing live on the air instead of a 10-minute Kid Rock concert or a joke of a Divas Battle Royal?  The tag team match was thrown off the show so that Kid Rock could sing?!?  Ummm...does WWE realize that the event is called WRESTLEmania, right?  I paid to see wrestling, not a concert!

Here's the thing I just don't understand. It's a scripted show, WWE knows they only have four hours in which to fit everything in, so why doesn't WWE plan it out better?  Set time limits for each match and segment so that everything can be shown, and nothing feels rushed.

Outside of two or three matches (none of which were for titles), this did not feel like Wrestlemania.  Had this been No Way Out or Backlash, the card would have been fine and I probably wouldn't feel as negatively as I do about the fiasco.  But it was Wrestlemania, it was the grandest stage of them all, and the WWE sorely disappointed.  To make a big deal out of the ""25th anniversary"" and then put forth what I, and millions of others, watched Sunday night was almost atrocious."
897,5.0,"after Sony BMG delaying this since 2007, it's about freaking time, I am so getting this, I was 4 when G1 first came out and it has been still my favorite since then, I still watch it after 25 years"
898,3.0,"Too pretty to give it less than 3 stars but the story, character development and choice of casting for Beast were 1 star.  Why would she return to the beast??  At first he threatens to kill her family if she ever leaves. But, then when she made a deal with him for one day with her family in exchange for a dance he went back on it.  So then she screams at him when he gets too personal with his feelings about her and told him that he would always disgust her.  He takes off and she spies on him eating a freshly killed boar, she is repulsed and runs away in disgust and fear.  Then, as she is fleeing the beast comes upon her, causing her to fall into the icy water right before he almost kisses her, I assume his breath still reeked of raw pig flesh?  She wakes up, right after this and is suddenly playful with him and he agrees to let her see her family.  When he warns her about staying away she says, ""Yeah yeah, you'll kill my family""  To which he replies, ""no, I will die"".  I even made the joke out loud ""well then now she is definitely not coming back you, ya monster (I mean even as a human he was a dick obsessed with killing a beautiful golden doe... a magical GOLDEN DOE! Plus, what is he, like 30 years older than her?  He is not even slightly hot!  What redeeming qualities did he have that would make Belle or for that matter the gorgeous forest nymph fall so desperately in love with him???  was it because this 50 year old actor is also listed as a CO PRODUCER???  Ugh, so wrong.  Anyways, we are to believe that between her falling into the frozen lake and waking up she somehow fell in love with the Beast which is why she chose to come back, for fear that he would die.  Sorry, but the writers relied on previous tellings of this story for the viewers to fill in the inevitable ""falling in love with each other"" bit.  They never showed us any development in their relationship.  Maybe it was edited out?  and what about the adorable puppy things that were her best friends?  What?  he literally never interacted with them!  Also the 2 brothers besides the jerk one were pointless.  Maybe they tried out for the role of the beast before they realized that it was already written for the old guy who got it and the lead actress freaking BEGGED the writers to give them roles so she could at least have some good looking guys to hang out with during filming?  Thats my guess.  Oh, and there is now way she could have dressed herself  and no way in HELL she could have done her own hair everyday.  But damn the sets, special effects, and costumes were so beautiful."
899,3.0,"When I first glanced at the description of this film I thought it was going to comprised of real footage strung together to make a story, but it's all fake. I would have prefered the real footage angle, but it's still an interesting idea.

LOOK is shot unlike any movie I've ever seen. By using only security cameras you know it took a lot of work to make these various stories work and connect in a cinematic fashion. The acting is at times believable and at others the performances will remind you that you are just watching a movie.

Overall, LOOK is worth viewing once if for no other reason than to show just how much Big Brother is really watching us everyday. I learned listening to the commentary that about half of the states in the U.S. allow bathroom and dressing room cameras by law. That is just so freaking wrong."
900,5.0,This disk is freaking awesome! It's got the original Ghost in the Shell as well as Ghost in the Shell 2.0 which is the updated and revamped version of the anime. If you watch both movies back to back you can see how well the updated film looks and how well the revamp went. I can't believe some of the comments here. Obviously there are many people out there who still haven't seen the old and new versions back to back. Every scene in GITS 2.0 has been revamped with the most obvious scene right at the beginning of the revamped film. All in all this is a nice disk with great extra's watch both movies back to back to get the full effect of GITS 2.0. You'll be glad you did.
901,1.0,"I first watched this movie YEARS ago on television and didn't understand it.  I think I was 10.  Well, 40 years have past since then and I still don't get the supposed ""charm"" of this film.  For starters, Crosby and Kaye are too old for their roles.  Like way too old.  Then you have to get past Rosemary Clooney's way-to-happy-to-be-here face/personae.  Add to that, sorry Clooney fans, she just can't sing.  I have always wanted to slap the face of the first person that ever told her that she could.  Ah.  Vera-Ellen.  Cutesy-cutesy and yes, she can dance (some) but her smile just gets in the way.

These four ""kids"" have the idea to go to Vermont to help out the old General of Crosby and Kaye from the war.  The General has an inn.  The ""kids"" have an idea.  (Oh, it's a little patriotic, too).  I find it stomach-turning to see/hear ""the kids"" on the train all excited about snow.  It's a song.  ""Snow"".  Rosemary Clooney wants to wash her face and hair in it.  No kidding.  Those are the lyrics.  This makes Clooney, right out of the gate, an idiot.  Who the hell wants to wash themselves in freaking snow?????  And Clooney is old enough to know better.

For a ""Christmas"" musical, there is woefully little holiday cheer here.

The General's former troops come to the inn, (thanks to ""the kids""; the troops obviously had nothing else to do on Christmas Eve) and the film goes dark and long and funeral-like.  Ghastly.  It's a long, long scene and one that the film should have done without.  Everyone rallies for the General.  Whomever he was/is.

What little comedy there is is supplied by Mary Wickes.  Well, thank God for that.  The plot twists don't even twist as movie fans have seen this sort of thing a thousand times before.  And better.

At the pinnacle of ""the big show"" that ""the kids"" have put on for the troops, everyone is singing ""White Christmas"", the barn door opens and it is snowing, and Rosemary Clooney gives Bing Crosby the gift of

a glass horse.

This is NOT a Christmas movie.  This is just plain 2 hours wasted out of your life."
902,5.0,"DBZ freaking rocks! This blu-ray is fantastic. This also has the classic American Soundtrack which aired when it ran on Toonami, which is the one I actually liked. I tried the other audio track, and it just sounded straight-up out of place."
903,2.0,"As weird movies go, this movie is weird.  I don't know how to characterize it.  Horror?  Science fiction?  Thriller?  Psychodrama?  All of the above.

The premise is straightforward:  A black box shows up at your door.  It has a button on top.  If you press the button, one million dollars will be delivered to you.  Also, someone you don't know will die.

But that premise leaves so many questions unanswered: Any negative consequences of pressing the button?  Who or what created this button box?  Why did they choose me to get this delivery?  Who will die?

There are so many ""What the...?"" moments and flashes in this film that is going to be hard to catalogue them in 30 minutes.  Like Memento or Inception (but not quite to that extent), this movie requires a second viewing.  Why is blood dripping from the noses of some characters, for example?  Late in the movie there is a pretty substantial reveal regarding the peculiar goings-on that dot the landscape of The Box.  But, even some questions are left partially unanswered as the film closes.  I liked it.

Cameron Diaz is a big star.  How she got involved in a weird flick that is painfully obviously based upon a science fiction short story is odd.  And her co-star is a James Franco knock-off, so maybe the producers went for him but had to get a look-alike as his stock rose.  In any event, Diaz and Franco-lite's life is what I would imagine for yuppies in the 1970s in the Washington, D.C. area.  He works for the government, NASA.  I don't recall if she even works or if that is relevant.  They live in a comfortable neighborhood surrounded by other comfortable folks.  They have one son, and the family seems close.  All is well.  But there is still that nagging, pestering bug in their ear for more or better.  More career success.  Diaz has a foot disfigurement that is embarrassing.  Like everyone in their suburban enclave, a little more money would ease a lot of their burdens.  They press the button.

And then it gets freaking weird.  The film unfurls itself in one of the most peculiar fashions.  There are some scene cuts that show mysterious happenings, but we don't know why.  These mysteries are not revealed until much later in the film.  (One that sticks out is a flash to a motel pool where a large group of people are walking into a blindingly lit pool. Huh???)  What this plot technique instills in the audience is a constant, wondering apprehension.  Good stuff.

The score also ramps up the creepiness and doom, which was effective at making my brain gears turn.  There were no Jack-in-the-Box, pop-out horror scenes, but that only added to the intrigue and dread.  I felt myself waiting to be scared silly, or for some gratuitous and gruesome violence.  It never came.  You know something big, ominous, and weird is happening in the background.  But what?  Who is pulling the strings?  I wasn't blown away by the answer, but it was an entertaining puzzle."
904,5.0,"this is probably one of the most realistic love stories i have ever seen. first off, you can't help but love zooey deschanel in anything she does. especially in this movie, where she plays summer finn, a realistic woman who doesn't believe in love, who thinks believing in love is like believing in santa claus. and then there's her better half, tom hensen, who never thought he would meet ""the one"" until summer came along.

and the movie jumps from day one of their relationship, to the end of it. you get the idea how the movie is going to end when you walk into it, with the narrator (who sounds like freaking james earl jones for chrissake) tells you that what you're about to see isn't a love story, but a story about love. same thing? i think not.

the movie is essentially about unrequited love. it's about the missed opportunities. the things that don't work out. it's a comedy, but it covers all of these depressing topics. and that's what i like most about it. as described best in the showtime series weeds, a story can be intensely dramatic and depressing, but have inexplicably hilarious moments that coincide better than you would imagine.

it's a movie that's both emotionally devastating and hopeful. it reminds me of something of a cross between the movies eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and garden state. it's a rare film that displays completely fabulous acting, and it's not just your average love story. it doesn't have a beginning and an ending. it jumps in an indistinct order between the five hundred days of their relationship. and when their relationship is in its heyday, there's a choreographed dance sequence, not unlike the scene in the 2007 film enchanted. and it shows events in an incredibly depressing, but completely true-to-life way, where there's a split screen, one side, what's really happening in that moment, and the other side, what the character tom wanted to happen. and when we're in love, we find ourselves doing things like this.

so what can i say about this movie? everything is fantastic, the acting (especially the beautiful zooey deschanel), the writing, and the way the story is told, it's one of the best movies i've seen in 2009."
905,1.0,"Now understand, I LOVE the movie. I am so excited to watch it, but I hate that they put the blu ray disc on ONE side and the DVD disc on the other side. So it's one disc but with two versions. Money grubbers is all I have to say about that. I paid about 30 dollars in stores for this ON SALE and they give me one freaking disc! That's not right, I've paid less for a blu ray disc, dvd disc, and a digital copy disc of other movies. I mean heck, Fantasia set was less than that and you got 2 movies - 2 on blu ray and 2 on dvd. I know that Twilight is a high profile movie and that's why they chose this one because they knew people would still buy it. But if I had known that I would have just bought the blu ray only version and saved myself some money.

 All in all I LOVE the movie and hate the production companies."
906,5.0,"First off if you don't have a sick sense of humor pass this movie, up you won't get it or understand why certain over the top things are freaking hilarious~! This movie was just as good as Something about Mary. I will definitely be buying this one for the collection. 4 guys go to Las Vegas and get so messed up they forget everything and have to piece things back together when they awaken. There's lots of nudity and foul language but it was appropriate for this type of comedy. sure some things were overboard, then again that's why they're in this movie. This is not a teenage movie in my opinion. also if you go and enjoy it stand by they are making a sequel...maybe a bachelorette party?"
907,2.0,"After all the defending I have done in the past of the HP movies, I think I deserve better.  The books are highly evolved AND involved, way too much content to try and cram into a cluster of a movie.  I thought movies 1-6 were incredibly done and I fought tooth and nail with ""real"" fans who thought they were so cool because they had read the books before the movies even came out and would bash everyone who liked the movies because the ""movies left too much out"".  But this movie, I will NOT defend in the same way.

Why?  Because it is garbage made with one purpose and that is this: $$$.  Lets see how we can keep our costs low and our earning high.  I thought the purpose of splitting this story into 2 movies was so that it could be exceptionally detailed and leave it all on the floor for the finale.  This is the closer for freaking Harry Potter, both movies could have been 3-4 hours long and people would have never even blinked the whole time!  Don't say you couldn't do more because you didn't have the right time frame.

The entire story is rushed.  Key events are left out (Krum and Harry's talk at the wedding, Kreature's major role, the insight to the Deathly Hallows) or changed, such as the scene with Wormtail.  That was an incredible part in the book, why did we just simply knock him out?!  It seems like the characters are uncomfortable with their lines and just trying to blurt them out as quickly as possible.  My heart was racing for the chase scene in the beginning but that was the most boring pile of crap I've ever seen!  When I read the Deathly Hallows and Hagrid fell from his broom, I was sure he was dead.  Everything pointed that direction, and when he was found to be alive, it was like the 2nd coming to me. But in this movie?  Oh no, lets cut that out so we can put Bill in here saying ""Hi, my name's Bill, I was attacked by a werewolf"", no better way of getting some back story than that huh?

I bet Rowling is pissed.  Sources tell me she has a history of being unhappy with the movies, especially for downplaying the elves and after what they did to Kreature I'm sure she'd like to come down with the hammer of the gods.  Please I beg you before watching this, if you have not read the books READ THEM so people like me aren't having to sit there with a whole group of people and explain every freaking detail because the POS movie left out most every important fact that you need to know!

Someone answer me this question, who was the cool looking snatcher guy with the long hair?  See, I read the book and I don't even know who that is!  Can someone please PLEASE reboot this movie?  Hell we are redoing Spider-Man, why not give a little more forethought into a work of literature that has pretty much been a major history mark for a generation?

Did this movie really not deserve a little more thought and time?  Did we really have to rush it?  I will say that yes, there is a lot of downtime in the book that wouldn't have been interesting enough for movie scenes but come on!!! Part 2 better be the best movie ever made or then I will know for a FACT these movies were made with the all mighty dollar sign in eyes and I will forever lose faith in novel adaptations.

This movie is OK for people who haven't read the books but I think even Potter fans that have never read a book in their life will notice this just isn't up to par.  I'm buying it simply to finish out my collection.  I give this movie 2 fingers WAY WAY up."
908,5.0,One of his best moments. Don't think it got enough publicity...whether you love or hate George W. Bush this is freaking hilarious.
909,5.0,this anime is really freaking cool! my ex has it though so i'm bummed:( cause it's just really freaking cool:)
910,5.0,"In 2007-2008, the first season of ""Samantha WHO?"" debuted after ABC''s  ""Dancing with the Stars"" and the show immediately was a big hit and received praise from many reviewers and viewers.  And eventually, the show was successful and was the highest rated sitcom for that year.

Unfortunately, the second season had a new schedule and no successful lead-in show and put up against other successful shows and the ratings dropped.  Although not a significant drop in viewership, ABC opted not to renew the show due to economic reasons (the network wanted producers to cut $500,000 from the budget per episode).

Despite the shocking cancellation of the series, fortunately ""Samantha WHO? - The Complete Second and Final Season"" is released on DVD and those who missed the final seven episodes can now catch it with this final release.

""Samantha WHO?"" is a sitcom created by Cecelia Ahern (writer of the 2007 novel ""P.S. I Love You"") and Donald Todd (writer for ""Ugly Betty"", ""Life As We Know It"" and ""Caroline in the City"").

The series is about a woman named Samantha (Christina Applegate, ""Married with Children"", ""Jesse"") who was a rude and not so kind person.  But after being a hit by a car, she has amnesia and doesn't remember too much about how she was in her past but with a few memories and what she learns about herself, she wants to make herself a better person.

Because she forgot so much, she is unable to work and is trying to piece together her life and thus she depends on her parents Howard (Kevin Dunn, ""Transformers"" films, ""Gridiron Gang"",  ""7th Heaven"") and Regina (Jean Smart, ""24', ""Frasier"" and ""Designing Women"") for their assistance.

And to help her through life are her two best friends and former co-workers such as the bad/party girl Andrea Belladonna (Jennifer Esposito, ""Rescue Me"", ""Related"" and ""Conspiracy"") and the chirpy Dena (Melissa McCarthy, ""Gilmore Girls""), her ex-boyfriend Todd (Barry Watson, ""What About Brian"" and ""7th Heaven"") and her apartment doorman Frank (Tim Russ, ""Star Trek: Voyager"", ""Life Free and Die Hard"" and ""iCarly"").

But as she has her memories of the way she was back then, she does have occasional memories of Todd and when they were a couple and how badly she treated him and even being proposed by him.  The problem is that once she has these memories, she forgets them.  Nevertheless, with friends and family she starts to get her life all situated.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Samantha WHO?"" is a sitcom presented in Widescreen (with an aspect ratio of 1:78:1) that is shot via a single camera and not the typical multiple camera setup.  So, one thing that people will realize about the series is that it looks more like a drama series and although shot on set, there are many scenes where the show is shot outdoors and the picture quality on DVD is very good.  For the most part, the series is well-lit and doesn't have the problems of excessive  low-noise or high compression.

As for the audio, ""Samantha WHO?"" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The series is primarily dialogue driven, so it's primarily front and center channel-driven.  I was hoping to hear an episode such as ""The Rock Star"" which takes place in a small concert stage with the audience cheering utilizing the surround channels, but I didn't really hear anything.

So, pretty much the series is front and channel driven but if you have a receiver capable of stereo on all channels.  Personally, I found that setting the best for watching the show.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Samantha WHO? - The Complete Second and Final Season"" comes with the following special features:

DISC 1:

Not necessarily a  special feature but if you select ""play all"" instead of individual episodes, you will be treated with the ""Samantha WHO? - Season One"" starter kit which is a recap of season 1.

DISC 2:

  * Deleted Scenes - Seven deleted scenes with an intro for each scene by Executive Producer Donald Todd.  Scenes deleted due to time conflicts.
  * Bloopers - (:53) Blooper reel
  * Set Tour With Christina Applegate - (4:42) Christina Applegate takes the viewers on a tour of ""Samantha WHO?"" and why there are chickens everywhere on the set of her family's home and more.
  * Christina Dance Moment - (3:11) Executive Producer Donald Todd talks about how Christina Applegate wanted to do an episode that involved dancing and how she had to dance badly and how difficult it was to film Christina and Jean doing bad dance choreography.
  * Girl Chat - (2:24) Christina Applegate, Jennifer Esposito and Melissa McCarthy answer questions about their character and relating to the show.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have to admit that I was shocked that ABC canceled ""Samantha WHO?"".  After all, the series was the top rated sitcom for its first season, Christina Applegate was nominated for an Emmy for Best Actress in 2008 and how courageous Applegate was by doing the show even though he had to face a mastectomy.

Needless to say, the show's viewership may have went down due to not having ""Dancing with the Stars"" as a lead in show but still, the show had millions of viewers and truthfully, many viewers and even entertainment magazine editors felt the show didn't deserve to be canceled.

But here we are with ""Samantha WHO? - The Complete Second and Final Season"" and fortunately, now people who missed the final seven episodes, can catch the second season in its entirety on DVD.  And for those who are wondering about how the series ended, fortunately the creators of the show managed to create a satisfying conclusion to the series.  Also, a bit open ended just in case another network wanted to pick it up.

The characters are just enjoyable to watch.  There are many episodes featuring Samantha remembering her past life and trying to start over with her new life despite not having any past memories.  Her mother Regina is actually quite interesting and to see the mother and daughter dynamics at work is quite hilarious.  Especially since Regine and Samantha have drifted apart since Samantha was a much different and crude person in the past.

Jennifer Esposito as Andrea Belladonna was very enjoyable to watch.  As Kim Cattrall's character of Samantha was for Carrie Bradshaw in ""Sex & The City"", Andrea is that sexy vixen who also has that crude/party girl humor that she brings into the friendship between her and Samantha.  And Melissa McCarthy as Dena is also quite interesting because she is so different from Samantha and Dena but she's still part of that circle and brings that perky ditsyness but also logical thinking at times.  So, for the most part, what makes ""Samantha WHO?"" so enjoyable is its characters and the wackiness that ensues in each episode.

Overall, ""Samantha WHO?"" was an enjoyable sitcom with plenty of comedy and every character was fun to watch.  In fact, there wasn't any episode that seemed boring at all. Again, I think it was a wrong decision by ABC to cancel the series but for those who were curious about the sitcom or fans who enjoyed the series, definitely pick up both seasons of  ""Samantha WHO?"" on DVD.  You definitely won't be disappointed!"

Pilot Hal Jordan goes for the ride of his life when his test pod is mysteriously transported from the safety of an airforce hanger to a rocky desert only to encounter a bizarre dying alien named Abin Sur, who had summoned Jordan via his powerful. Abin Sur dies and Hal's world is turned upside down and he is introduced to the Green Lantern Corps, guardians of the galaxy. Under the tutelage of Sinestro, Hal learns to use his newfound power and witness, thanks to Sinestro's words and actions, that the Guardians of Oa--those who created the Green Lantern Corps and the green lantern power battery--have grown soft in their approach to intergalactic crime. Sinestro believes a more stern approach is needed and so takes Hal under his wing to show him that might makes right.

The Corps faces a crisis as the Yellow Element--the only force capable of weakening the Green Element, which powers the Corps's green battery on Oa--has been stolen. Should it be used against them, the Green Lantern Corps will crumble and the galaxy as we know it will no longer be protected and chaos and evil will reign.

Green Lantern, to me, has always been a cool character, yet he's also always been an overlooked character outside the realm of us hardcore superhero guys. Batman? Sure. Superman? We know him even better. Spider-Man? Yeah, good movies on the big screen. But Green Lantern? Wasn't he that green guy from that old Super Friends show, the one with that ring that does stuff and, um, well . . .

Green Lantern is an outside character. He's known and he's unknown. I think of him like Superman, the difference being is he takes the ring off and he's a guy like you and me. Superman doesn't have that option because no matter what kind of clothes he's wearing, he'll always be a Kryptonian. Green Lantern: First Flight reminds us of that: that beneath the cool power ring Hal Jordan is just your average guy.

I really appreciated the origin tone of this movie and even more so that 99% of it didn't take place on Earth. Here we got to get a solid look at the world of Green Lantern, which is an intergalactic one and not confined to a bustling Metropolis or an eerie Gotham.

To see the Green Lantern Corps--all those aliens with varied green uniforms--really added to the scope of what the Corps is all about and a visual reminder that humanity's protection is only a small part of what they do. According to this movie, there are 3600 green lanterns, each with their own sector to watch over. Solid.

I had only a couple minor quibbles with this movie. I thought Hal Jordan dove into the Green Lantern thing rather quickly. He gets the ring and suddenly--BAM--he's all green and knows what to do. He also seemed too casual and calm about all these alien encounters he suddenly finds himself having. If that was you or me, we'd be freaking out the second Abin Sur showed up, green ring or otherwise.

Likewise, Hal Jordan seemed to be the only guy who got back to wearing regular clothes when the ring came off, whereas everyone else still retained their uniform. I thought the uniform came with the ring. Take the ring off and you're back to wearing whatever it was when you put it on.

Again, minor, but something I would have liked to have seen handled better.

I know that comic books and comic book movies are not as much for kids as they used to be. Once again this DC film has some foul language in it. Not impressed because it's kids asking their moms for these flicks. It's not like the old days where superhero cartoons were clean language-wise.

The action is great. The fights are cool.

If Green Lantern: First Flight is meant as a primer for the upcoming live action film, man, we're in for a real treat and an awe-inspiring experience coming 2011.

This flick is solid, enjoyable and fun. Check it out.

912,1.0,"i'm sorry. the oldest son's girlfriend is an absolutely clueless moron. she overacts every movement she does. she tries to be sexy, but fails miserably! she over turns, over bends, over flips her hair, over moves her hips, over stands, over sits, overs everything!  most of all, she is the lowsiest kisser i've ever seen in my life!  whenever she goes in for a kiss, she looks down at the ground and then swoopes her head and face up and the kiss is over before her boyfriend even has a chance to react. she pulls away before the ""sexy"" kiss even starts. she starts off at the beginning  of the movie supposedly being an intelligent girl who's helping her boyfriend get into a good college. by the end of the movie she turns into an overacting airhead who can't put 2 and 2 together. She has no analitical skills whatsoever which completely leads her to being totally incapable of  deducing that david(the stepfather) is a freaking psychopathic when it is completely obvious from the beginning due to the ENORMOUS amount of red flags that are thrown up throughout INCLUDING A FREAKING POLICE SKETCH THAT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE THE FATHER!!! atleast in the original, Terry O'Quinn did a good job of covering his identity and hiding any photos which might expose his history and murdurous past, and, atleast the girl in the original knew how to give an incredibly passionate kiss. this movie will highly annoy you and anger you by the cast's level of stupidity, ESPECIALLY, if you've seen the original. they aren't stupid in a good b-movie sense either if you're thinking that might be a possible quality of the film which i just don't get that has led to my infurious rant. NO! they're stupid because they're freaking stupid and individuals who can stomach this movie and consider it a piece of fine art need to goto college and educate themselves on the qualifications of what makes a piece of literature or film praiseworthy."
913,1.0,"I will admit, I had low expectations coming into this movie, but I love horror.  There was just something about the previews that did not interest me.  The movie was on TV (free) so I decided to give it a chance.  The first time I watched it, I fell asleep after 20 minutes or so.  Okay, maybe it was just late and I was tired.  The next day, my wife and I saw that it was on again and my wife (not a horror buff) was interested to see it.  As we watched the movie, we began to easily predict what would happen next and it quickly became laughable.  I know that a movie is bad when I start to get up off the couch and do chores around the house...  After predicting just about everything that was happening, I began doing chores around the house...  UNFORTUNATELY, I made it back for the big ending.  Can you say worst freaking ending EVER!!!!!  I came in just as the bad guy from Quantum of Solace was saying ""She is a Keeler (killer) Dwaaarf (midget), get out of da house!"".  My wife and I literally erupted in laughter. I commented to my wife that we just invested 90 minutes of our time that we will NEVER get back, just to find out that this chick is a freakin killer dwarf....  Now I have seen it all.  I was waiting for Chucky to come running in to help her at the end (UGH!).  Please do not see this movie!!!!  Here is a super quick summary if you really want to know:
1. They adopt a little creepy girl who dresses weird and says she is from Russia
2. All kinds of bad things start happening  (Think Omen 4...)
3. 1 parent is basically being set up and framed to be the bad guy and the other parent is the clichd moron who is complete denial of any wrong doing. Here is the type of thing to expect.
""Honey, the neighbor was found dead with an axe buried in his back!!!"".  ""Oh come on, dear he probably just backed into the wall where the axe was hanging and it accidentally got stuck in his back and killed him.  Crazy things happen like this all the time...""
4. 1 parent starts an investigation into the ""child's past"" and discovers that she is ""a keeler dwaarf"".
5. There is the typical cheesy fight scene in a dark house where the villain seems to have super strength and cannot seem to die. (You could hit her with a baseball bat, drop an anvil on her head, spray her with a flame thrower and she still keeps coming)
6. Villain goes down, the end.
This movie is crap and is a disgrace to killer dwarfs around the world!"
914,1.0,"Two terrible things about this steaming pile of docudrama. Well, the worst two anyway... 1. The guys who made this (aka You're too old to be dressing like late 1980's/early 90's hair band members) have to be the worst interviewers EVER! One of them asks the same freaking question four times to the same kid in a 2 min interview (so it didn't hurt, you didn't feel any pain, so was it painful, you didn't feel anything?) WOW! That's a great contribution! Following that was ""You wasn't scared?"" DERP! The word is WEREN'T! You're supposed to be making a MOVIE! Hello!! How about learning a few interview skills before you make interviews part of your freaking movie?!? 2. The storyline was DISJOINTED, CHAOTIC, CONFUSING with no logical sequence or order! This fluff is a documentary based on a story, only there is NO STORY TOLD. Just unfocused meanderings. Anyone with a camera and some equipment in his girlfriend's basement does not qualify as a filmmaker."
915,3.0,"This is a five star compilation with three star packaging and a zero star price. Universal gave us 8 movies in the Hammer Horror Collection for just $29.98 (on sale thru Amazon for $24.99)and Warner gave us 6 movies in the beautiful Legends of Horror collection for $39.98 which seemed high at the time (on sale thru Amazon for $29.99) but the controllers at Columbia MUST be out of their freaking minds. $80.95 RETAIL PRICE??? For this??? 8 poorly packaged movies and only 3 of which have not been previously released to DVD. Most Castle fans are rebuying DVD's they already have in their collection. As a set, it is overall very cool. There could be more extras but then again, there could be less. It is what it is but at this price, it is insanity. I just purchased it for $35.99 on sale through Amazon (thank you Amazon for being fair) with free shipping and I still felt slightly ripped off. Personally, if I had to pay more than I did for this collection, I would boycott buying it altogether until I found it for a better price. I commend Amazon and give them 10 stars for allowing us fans a REASONABLE and SANE price!! Applause for Amazon!! Boos and hisses for Columbia!!"
916,1.0,"I payed 15 bucks plus tax for this garbage movie. Lol! For the love of Christ these guys are good con artists. The freaking trailer looked like it would be a hell of a movie like someone else alerady said. Bad acting, Terrence Morris or whatever his name is used a terrible and gay irritating voice. The white guy can't even fight worth ish. He spends half the movie getting his tail kicked. The fights we're mediocre at best, even worst is the acting and lines. A horrific movie, please don't waste your time. The only bright spot about this movie is the hot latina chick. And I like latinas! That's why it earned a 1, otherwise I'd give it a freaking zero."
917,4.0,"For three seasons, Maxwell Smart and his partner 99 have flirted around with a sorta-kind-attraction. If only he weren't so oblivious.

But things change drastically in the fourth season of the classic spy spoof. Oh, there's still the usual struggles on behalf of the forces of goodness and niceness, with plenty of whacked-out spoofery and weird plots, but the real focus here is on the new developments in Max and 99's relationship. First comes love, then comes marriage... what next?

A mission at a TV station leads to some interesting problems for Max and 99 -- when cornered in Chaplin costumes, Max confesses his feelings to 99. And she interprets it as a proposal!

On their way to the altar, Max and 99 have other problems to deal with, including impersonating the infamous bank robbers Connie and Floyd, unfortunate ""accidents"" that befall Max's best men, andSiegfried's diabolical vegetable-decimating scheme... right down the street from 99's mother.  And the wedding itself is thrown into KAOS when Max is fed a secret map which requires him to stay vertical for 48 hours. Obviously this may cause problems for the wedding, not to mention the honeymoon.

And the newlyweds are confronted by many other problems: a laser blazer, disappearing couriers, toxic neighbors, a giant diamond, an invisibility formula (by a gorgeous female scientist), the infamous Leadside, missile explosions near gold courses, a budget cut that forces 99 to get a new job, an awkward visit by Max's doppelganger (the king of Coronia!), the Chief dating a very young woman, undead KAOS couriers sent by a mad scientist, and KAOS kidnapping countless Control agents.

Obviously the biggest change in ""Get Smart: Season 4"" is that Max and 99 finally get together, get engaged, and marry. It does take away some of the simmering tension now that they've reached the romantic finish line, but fortunately the fourth season still has enough insane Evil Plots and clever film spoofs (""Ironside,"" ""Frankenstein,"" ""Rear Window,"" ""Great Escape"") to compensate.

Along the way, there are plenty of bizarre plots by the evil KAOS (KAOS zombies stealing trucks!) and bizarre puzzles that Max and 99 somehow work out, often by putting themselves in comical danger, ranging from airfights to fencing matches with a wheelchair-bound art-lover. But there are also some more down-to-earth problems that the newlyweds face, such as Max meeting his future mother-in-law, or 99 freaking out at Max's lateness to the wedding.

And the dialogue and comic relief are absolutely priceless (""HOLY KUMQUAT!"" a poor tailor howls as Max drives him off the deep end), and fortunately wedding bells don't signal the end of gutsplitting comedy (Max gets shot in the backside). Seriously, it hardly ever gets serious -- even the wedding has 99 and the tattered Chief solemnly stepping over unconsious bodies.

Don Adams is the heart of the series, with his quirky face, nasal voice, odd body language and confident catchphrases (""And loving it!""). Barbara Feldon plays a wonderful straight woman to Max's goofiness, and they both fit well as both romantic and professional parters -- even when they end up marooned on a KAOS island for their honeymoon. Only 99 could put up with the kind of things Max does... like blow up the boat and discard the paddles.

On the supporting side, Edward Platt is just wonderful as the long-suffering Chief, and Bernie Kopell gets to have LOTS of fun as ""Ziegfried."" Not only does he get to be the Red Baron, pilot a floating island, and be the commandant of POW camp Camp Gitchee Goommee Noonee Wa-Wa (""When they get here and find we are running a prisoner of war camp without a license, we'll be arrested!"").

""Get Smart Season 4"" loses the romantic tension, but it still has plenty of hilarity and insanity -- secret plans, spies, and the occasional evil maid."
918,5.0,I am new to GA I like Zaks style of ghost hunting. He is kind of stuck on himself but he is a gentleman and he is very smart. Aaron and Nick are great and the show wouldn't be right without them. It would be better if Zak was not so mean to Aaron. I love  the show and the guys and the reenactments are real cool sometimes gross. I used to like Ghost Hunters but they have gotten so geeky... I mean someone farts and they are freaking out like it all paranormal and I've seen one dude open a door and move crap and he plays it off like everyone is stupid and we didn't see it.
919,5.0,"I bought this movie for 1 reason... ""Anna Paquin"".... I Loved her is the HBO series ""True Blood""... I won't give the story away... But its like 3 or 4 stories... like Creepshow.... all in one movie... the way they do it is really cool... if your watching one story... you will see a cameo from some one from another story... over and over... I was kinda messed up already with the meds Im on... I was kinda freaking out while watching it... Its a cool movie... And it was nice to see ""Sookie"" (from True Blood) again... This is a good movie to watch around Halloween... Or in my opinion... Any time at all..."
920,1.0,"I have been waiting 2 years to see this film. I've been reading all of the glowing reviews, and was very happy when I saw that Warner Brothers was FINALLY putting this out. I own almost 4,000 movies, and 600 TV box sets, and I buy most of them used so that I can get them for under $10. I wanted to see this one so badly that I did not even want to wait to get it shipped by Amazon - I ran into Best Buy on the first day it was available, and even though it was only 12:30, I got the last copy they had. I got home and watched the film (not as good as I had expected based on the prior reviews, but not bad - as mentioned before, it's sort of a cross between ""Creepshow"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" with a bunch of cameos form genre veterans including Tamoh Penikett from ""Dollhouse"" and ""BSG"" and Britt McKillup from ""Dead Like Me.""). Then I went to check out the extras. All I got was a short ninety second cartoon from 1996. I was not all that surprised, given the shoddy treatment of this film that they hadn't produced any extras. But then I went on-line, and discovered that there are the usual deleted scenes, director's commentary, and making of featurette - but ON THE BLUE RAY ONLY! Give me a freaking break Warner Brothers!!!!!!!! I could understand not wanting to do a 2-disc release for this, but the movie was only an hour and fifteen minutes long! There is NO EXCUSE for not including the extras on this disc. It's a slap on the face to the fans who have waited 2 years for this. My advice - if you want to see this movie, wait for it to come to cable. You won't be missing anything. And if you did waste your money on this disc,  please write to Warner to express how annoyed you are at them. I personally will not be buying any more Warner Brothers movies for awhile - and I try to buy almost every horror movie that comes out. WARNER BROTHERS - I HATE YOU!!!!"
921,2.0,"My fiance and I have been jonesing for a good scary movie to watch and this appeared on not one, but a few 'top scary movie' lists. Why...I have no freaking idea. This movie was so bad that we stopped watching it around 45 mins or so in. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll just stop there. In saying that, we're still on our quest..."
922,3.0,"Remakes of classic films like this are always by people who have already seen the original, or those who haven't. The inherent problem in that is that you already have an opinion of the original, and hence you have things about it you really liked or really didn't like. Well, if you never saw the original, you don't have to worry about that, and chances are you'll like it much better while staying ignorant of the original.

So, let's answer the obvious questions. Is it a good remake? Well, no; It just doesn't seem to understand the core of the original, and hence is sort of cheap and a somewhat quirky slasher versus slasher flick. It never feels like it has the heart of the original, nor does it have anywhere near the quality of its own. Is it a good film on its own? Well, yeah, it's pretty good, and would be better if the original never existed. As someone who has seen the original, it's very saddening to see unwelcome changes that just make your heart sink.

Let's try to make this real brief. Let's start with the good: This remake has a cool style that works, good actors for the bad guys and just-OK actors for the good guys, a few replacement scenes that are arguably more powerful than in the original, and it completely eliminates the dull cops from the original, as they never show up in any form here--which is good, as they were sort of annoying in the original. It lets us focus on what really matters: The bad guys in disguise, and the good guys who learn they're the people who assaulted, raped, terrorized, and shot their daughter, and are trapped with them with the advantage of surprise. All of this is a good thing.

But then we've got the bad. On its own terms, it lacks the same audaciousness as the first. The obvious one is that our two girls, Mari and her friend, are just nobodies. They have no character, no reason to care about them, and virtually no character development before Mari gets herself trapped. By the time the tension starts, the film fails to give you a reason to care about either of them on any personal level. They're just there, two pretty girls who ended up in a bad spot. But Paige is downright unlikable, and Mari is a sweet little teenage girl, plus something about her brother being dead, or something like that which doesn't really make up for her total lack of character.

In the original, Mari was not a goody-two-shoes sweetheart, and was out for pot just as much as her friend. Both of them are reckless teenagers who naturally feel invincible and so don't mind putting themselves in dangerous situations. You know, the usual kind of teenager that gets in serious trouble because they think bad things happen to other people, not them. Also, Justin here is made to be a saint, albeit a really stupid saint for bringing them to Krug's apartment hoping they don't come back. Nice going, Justin. (When you think about it, the entire movie is completely his fault for enticing them back to his apartment with good intentions gone horribly wrong.) In the original, Justin's character (named Junior then) is a heroin addict who willingly lures the girls back to Krug's apartment with the exact same promise of pot. He does this not because he's a nice guy, but because Krug controls him through heroin fixes. So the trouble starts the wrong way here. It's an accident here due to the moronic good-natured intentions of a stupid kid who happens to have a total psychopath caretaker he simply didn't expect to come back. In the original, all of it was intentional for a heroin fix. It's easy to see why one of these makes a lot more sense than the other. With here, it's stupidity, not an actual trap. It doesn't feel right, and you have to be like, ""Oh, come on."" when Justin has his ""Crap! They're back! How is that possible, when I have every reason to suspect they're coming back and might rape and kill these two girls like the others!?"" face.

The events unfold totally differently here and in a completely different way, so let's get to the important part. Yes, for everyone who was worried they'd leave it out, there's a rape scene with Krug violently tearing Mari apart with his dong. It's pretty long, much longer than the original scene, but it's also a bit muted, and slightly less in the unrated version. Also worth mentioning is that she's mostly uninjured before it begins. In the original, she had already endured an entire night of abuse, is covered in blood, and she's face-to-face with Krug as he's practically drooling all over her face as he's doing his thing. Considering that part of this film was *completely about the rape scene to demonstrate a point*, you may prefer this version, or you may prefer the original's somewhat more brutal, but briefer, scene. Additionally, they stab Paige a few times to kill her, instead of outright dismembering her like the original. The whole thing is really nasty, and of course, Mari dies then after being shot in the head three times after being raped and cut open a few more times.

A remake, I think, should not cut back on the original. So, really, I can't help but think of that as a missed opportunity to really blow away the audience by amping it up even more. There's really no reason they couldn't except for that beautiful R-rating they need, instead of getting knocked up to NC-17.

You know, let's just sum it up as that's the movie's real problem. It *can't* show the same brutality with the same dark humor and off-tone scenes. It's not really the actors' faults, and I especially liked Francis in this replacing Weasel, who comes off as far more threatening and less like just a sadistic idiot.

Oh, and sadly, no chainsaw scene here. Yeah, I know, I would say, ""Huh?"" too. It seemed like a core finisher for the doctor as revenge for her daughter to thrust a chainsaw through his whole body, but they simply screwed it up here. Badly. Not only that, it's been done before. Rather lamely, the doctor uses a broken microwave to fry the guy's head until it explodes. It's not all that interesting, it's been done before, and the doctor never comes off as threatening at any point, or really all that angry like he should be.

So, the original is far darker--but this one has that ""modern"" style which works pretty well, but just isn't the same. They cut back on scenes that would probably put them in NC-17 territory, which would've been no good, and it's just...bleh. The entire point of the film is to demonstrate how dangerous a simple outing in a dangerous neighborhood can be, and what can ultimately end up as a result. This version holds itself back, so that message doesn't really resonate. Mari just wasn't supposed to survive the assault, and it's highly unlikely it would happen here, considering that she gets shot right in the shoulder and yet somehow makes it *all the way back to her house just by swimming*. It's kind of stupid, and there's no one that could do that even if they weren't shot. There's a current. Sure, the distance isn't catastrophically long (they crashed near her house), but she was just raped and freaking shot in the shoulder. She shouldn't even be able to use her arm, much less swim like a champion during a thunderstorm. It cheapens the film and makes it less realistic due to Mari's survival. It doesn't make sense.

On the bright side, if you've never seen the original, you have a far better chance of getting something out of this, since you won't constantly be disappointed by the highly altered sequence of events or the lack of tone the original had, which was just way more effective for its point, since it stayed dead in reality. Here, well, not so much.

As a remake, this is three stars. Add one star if you've never seen the original. And that's that."
923,5.0,"This is so totally awesome that I don't even know where to begin!!! Beyond Good and Evil is so totally freaking awesome!!! Do you like X-men? If you do then you're gonna love this one! This is the best of the series. Even if you don't know about the X-men, you're bound to enjoy this. Great for boys from 8-92. If you've got a kid inside you then you'll love this stuff. I don't want to ruin any of the stories but Beyond Good and Evil is so great. There's time travel, there's drama, there's a little comedy. Well rounded script."
924,2.0,"The intro to this movie was so amazingly intriguing and I wanted that to be the story... but while this movie had some VERY interesting STARTS to a story, it didn't finish any of them, except (SPOILER) that the kid got his music player back... and from none other than the freaking old guy who was in the intro. The main guy (who I LOVE, he played the Arcaanan in MIB3) had NO balls, nothing was ever resolved... nothing cool ever happened... we didn't figure out ANY of the questions that the movie posed. And that really pissed me off. I will say that I love every other Cohen Brothers film I've seen. And I hope this doesn't stop Unicorn Head from playing other amazing roles, because he's great. He was even great in this.... so. Yea."
925,1.0,"First, let me just say that I never cared for Sam Raimi. I'm more a Carpenter/Craven/Roth fan, not horror comedy. But even if I try to look at it from the perspective of Raimi fans, I can't imagine they would possibly be happy with the end-product here.

Really, it's just a totally lifeless premise that does nothing to save itself. First, the main antagonist is basically an undead gypsy and her Lamia friend. Nevermind that I know what a Lamia is, and it isn't in any way a goat, so why they decided to go with a goat to describe the Lamia, I'll never understand that. Historically, a Lamia's features are a lot more frightening than a freaking goat. Second, there isn't a single scary scene in the whole film, which relies essentially on the same thing Paranormal Activity did, albeit with a *LOT* more CG, and poorly-done CG, at that. I can't imagine anyone being scared of a room with everything blowing around and people screaming, or a toothless malicious gypsy, or food turning into maggots or whatever (yes, I know of the bulimia theory for the film and how often the title character is referred to as once being a fat kid and how much she hates it, hence the focus on food becoming evil).

It's hard to imagine an ending this unsatisfying. Everything comes down to this stupid little mistake the protagonist makes, and nothing more. It's nothing epic or worthy or even significant to the character. It's just there as a random act that could happen to literally anyone out of nothing but stupidity.

Basically, nothing here works. Our main character has no personality, the ""antagonists"" are so stupid as to not even be funny in this context, the whole film resides on disgusting the audience with constant images of maggots and toothless gypsies and other things of the sort, mixed in with ""screamer"" scares, rather than, you know, demons, or whatever.

I can't believe anyone would find this enjoyable, especially with the really, really distracting CG work whenever something goes wrong. It's so obviously CG and incredibly unrealistic-looking, and nothing in the entire film is frightening. Worse, the protagonist is just plain boring and stupid, so you can neither root for the villain nor the hero (at least Craven made Freddy Krueger someone you *wanted* to win at the end of every film because he somehow made killing funny, and in his other movies the villains were so unbelievably and viciously malevolent and soulless that you were glad when the protagonist won, and Carpenter had a knack for creating believable protagonists and very creative villainous things that didn't follow typical horror-film norms).

I recommend skipping this unless you enjoy bad horror films. (That's not sarcasm, I know some people like that type of genre just for laughs.) There are no scares, no characters for which we could feel any sympathy, a totally stupid villain, *WAY* overdone CG work, and nothing to make up for any of it.

If you want something that has some thought behind it, or really, anything scary or shocking, just skip this. There's a whole other league of horror films with far better writing, acting, and creativity."
926,3.0,"I'm giving it two stars because although it was a really bad horror movie it had some LOL moments.  If it was listed as a comedy I probably would have given it another star.

The first 25%, 30 minutes into the movie, was just a absolute turn your stomach make you feel sick putrid story-less intro.  I stopped watching it because I was so sick, I loath horror movies that are not scary at all and just try to gross you out, THAT IS NOT HORROR.  After a few days decided to try it again because I freaking had a copy.  I started it at 30 minutes because I didn't want to be grossed out again.  After the gross stuff there is some cheap make you jump suspense crap which lasts for 10 minutes then something strange happens; it turns into a full blown comedy.  I'm serious, it's a comedy from here on out.  The entire mood of the movie just changes to comedy.  I'm not kidding.  I'm serious.

Anyway, there are some really really funny parts in the second half of this movie both because it is just plain bad CG and just because the main character just changes her whole outlook.  The entire concept of being drug to Hell is also just laughable.

This is a pathetic movie and I can't believe there are more 5 star than any other rating.  I'm rating it low because it was so foul at the beginning, if it wasn't for that then I would have rated it higher.  The scary parts are mostly suspense, not horror.  The second half is just comedy.  Even tough I rated it so low I would still say rent it once but in no way would I ever recommend buying it.  In fact, you know what, I'm changing it to 3 stars because it had some really funny parts but not more because it was so foul, but still rent don't buy."
927,4.0,"this was  agood film, entertaining, loud, creepy jumped at times and part of this film reminded me of the classic poltergeist where the domosn fallowed , bugged that little girl, if she were sitll alive it could of passed as a  part 4 or soemthing where shis fianlly allgrown up or soemthing it was freaking me out at times, creepy and awefully loud back round but ifyou likes these kinds it is enjoyable"
928,5.0,THIS MOVIE HAS GOT TO BE THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE OF THE LAST 3 DECADES!! The truth behind this movie would freaking shock most!
929,1.0,"Ah this movie had such beautiful graphics, but the story was too much for me to stand.  First off the story is horribly stupid.  NEVER EVER would a civilization from before the industrial age ever be able to defeat a space faring civilization.  That is just flat out stupid, stupid, stupid!  Next is the idea that an animal would develop an appendage that allowed it to be controlled by another.  A horse can be tamed, and taught, but a horse isn't going to create a magical butt-tail-controller.  Seriously???  The aliens had a tail that pops out of their rears!!!  For peat sake, evolutionary speaking no species will grow an appendage to where it can be taken over and controlled.  Next is the idea of the floating mountains.  This is a very nice fanciful thought, but the huge problem is that in order for those mountains to stay more or less at the same altitude they would need to replace all that water that is floating off of them.  This doesn't take into consideration that they would constantly be crashing into each other changing their mass which would further cause them to change altitude.  Then of course is the problem of the animals being bullet proof.  For peat freaking sake no animal can with stand a bullet, not even funky dinosaurs on a weird planet.  For starters bullets can punch through metal, and I am certain that any animal skin or plate is not harder than metal.  All of those creatures charging the machine guns would have been turned to pulp.  Like I said this movie has pretty graphics, but other than that it is horrible.  I couldn't watch all of it, it was just too much to stand."
930,5.0,This movie is still totally awesome! How many years ago was it released? It seems like yesterday. This movie is actually totally freaking awesome! They pulled it off. I never thought they would. I never thought they could. This movie is an absolute mind blowing experience. This movie is one for the books. It is a must see adventure. I really do love it when a plan comes together!
931,5.0,"Not to my surprise, Avatar was beyond amazing. Up until I actually saw it for myself, I had been letting the critics' opinions influence how I felt about this movie. But as I got ready to go see it I erased all those feelings I had, and it blew me away. And NO, it wasn't just the visual effects that I loved so much. The story was solid as well. I have read the many complaints of all of the peoples who were not as pleased with the film as I was, but I don't really care about what they have to say. It took James Cameron over a decade to finish his project, and some people are just not going to appreciate all the hard work that went into making it. Until the time comes for them to do it themselves, they are going to continue to nitpick every minor detail. Honestly, it doesn't really matter if they do or not because it's already a strong number one as the highest grossing film of all time, so obviously somebody liked it. But about the film. I'll start where everyone can agree, with the visual effects. I don't really think they raise the bar, because they were so expensive to make, that it was damn near impossible for them to be bad. The effects in Avatar are nothing short of beautiful. The various colors in the forests are all vivid and lively during the day, and equally beautiful in the darkness of the night. And the colorful creatures that inhabit the moon called Pandora, are also just as detailed and beautiful to look at. The supposedly upgraded 3D didn't blow me away with its innovation, but the sense of immersion was a welcome treat. It really enhanced the experience. Some of the people I saw the movie with said, ""If that's what Heaven looks like, then I'm ready to go right now!"" That quote says it all for the visuals. Now let's get to the story.

Of course the story was not entirely unique, but it was still good enough to make me want to watch this movie again and again. People love to say this story was just a knock off of Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas, but I have to disagree. So what if a man joined the group he was originally against, and so what if he fell in love with the princess. Nothing is entirely new these days. Almost every fresh idea has been taken some way or another. Getting past the plot, there are a few script problems. The script is the touchiest subject. On one hand, a USC Linguist was brought in to create a unique language for the Na'vi to speak. And he did a fantastic job with that. It is very apparent that a lot of effort went into that aspect, but on the other, we have the people. For the most part, everyone's lines are fine. Except for a lot of Colonel Quaritch and Trudy. A lot of what Col. Quaritch said was too basic and dull for my taste, but he doesn't get enough screen time to ruin the movie. James Cameron admitted that he only spent two to three weeks of the ten years plus on the script, and it shows. But this movie is still a classic, and one of the best of 2009. It's arguably one of the best of the decade. Proof of how great it is was the running time. Avatar was about two hours and forty minutes, but it went by so fast that it left me wanting more. Usually I'm happy with where a long movie ends, but this one was different. I could have easily sat through another half hour. So a few corny lines in a nearly three hour movie don't take anything away from the experience.

It's a definite must-see for all ages. And I don't believe that it's only good in 3D. Of course everyone should see it in 3D while it's still in the first theatres, just to get the maximum out of it, but seeing it in 2D would not take anything away from its greatness. For a long while, Avatar was my favorite movie of 2009, but after seeing Star Trek a couple more times that one took over, then the same thing happened with District 9. That doesn't mean that I cannot make up my mind, just that 2009 was a fantastic year for the Science Fiction genre. Now finally, the Extended Collector's Edition additions...in one word? Wow. The two new cuts add more than I thought they would. With the exception of the scene in the bar on Earth when the guy slaps his girlfriend, I think all of the extra footage should never have been cut. It was really essential plotline stuff. Neytiri's sister's subplot adds so much. And the sturmbeest hunt scene showed us how Jake earned his title as a ""Stone Cold Aerial Hunter"". Why was that not in the theatrical cut? IMAX runtime constraints shouldn't be an excuse to cut valuable footage. I also have to say I appreciated the Tsu'tey death scene. That's not a spoiler because everyone on the planet has seen this movie. And the extras, oh man the extras were top notch. This edition really feels like something that gets released a decade or two after a film has had time to settle into pop culture. What am I talking about? This is freaking Avatar. Only the biggest film ever made. Highly recommended."
932,5.0,"I know there is a lot of controversy surrounding this release. Yes, a DVD was released last year, a bare bones DVD at that, and now they're releasing this. Big freaking deal.

Personally, I don't care about all that crap. I didn't buy the original DVD, and if I had it may somewhat alter my opinion, but I didn't. This is the first Avatar DVD I have bought, and to be honest, originally I had no desire to see Avatar. I had an ex girlfriend who ruined the movie for me and I just didn't want to see it, but one day I was bored and ordered it On Demand. And I loved it.

This set is fantastic, it's got three versions of the film. The first is the original theatrical version, then there's the re-release version with eight minutes of new footage, and THEN there's the collector's edition with 16 minutes of new footage. Epic doesn't even begin to cover it.

The documentary is great too. It covers all the aspects of filming and is probably 90 minutes long. Very interesting.

If you liked Avatar and bought the bare bones DVD, I suggest you sell it and buy this one."
933,1.0,"First off this movie isn't even a product yet, So why waste your time typeing GO BLOG or something about your life. 2nd This movie isn't even good in 3D! if you didn't see it in 3D, you obviously wasted 2 hours and 40 min of your life. Its 5 stars for visuals but thats about it.

This movie is like Pocahontas Meets World of Warcraft Meets Last Samurai meets Dances with wolves. This movie was only made for freaking cameron to express his views on the military (Which he clearly hates) How humans are ""Apparently"" destroying the earth (freaking activist i hate CAMERON) the only great movie he has ever done is T2. Aliens 1 and 2 where ok. Titanic was crap and not only that Cameron recycled his composer for Titanic and used the same guy (James Horner for this one) I was not impressed by the very weak story in this film. I would rather watch Disney's Pochontas which had BETTER music and a better story. infact PIXAR ANY movie has better then this crap. Save your self $15.00 in IMAX 3D and go watch something else like UP or Star Trek or Sherlock Holmes. The only reason I saw this is my mom took me to see it.

I wasted my life on this movie you shouldnt either. the Story blew.

However, one thing i will Nod to James is he created this entire universe from scratch kudos for that. This isn't cinema this is ripping off people and makeing Cameron a Titanic 2."
934,4.0,"Not bad and quite entertaining. Back in the 50's and 60's nukes were the culprits in many creature features today the alarmist's bell is ringing for climate change which is responsible for everything from acne to parasitic insects that infect and destroy. This is one of those. Val Kilmer, who is always good, plays a ecologist turned eco-terrorist and bugs are the vermin that are coming to destroy all life. If you are freaked-out by the creepy, crawlies then you will have a freaking good time. Very well done scenes of insect creepiness as they get under your skin and ultimately poke out of your eyes, nose and mouth after you are dead - very cool. The scene in which a guy gets his arm chopped off to avoid infection is particularly disturbing - and I mean that in a good way. Good movie."
935,5.0,"I was turned onto Mr. Bean by a friend, who told me that he had seen it after searching for something to watch one night, and well we both agreed the show seemed silly from the clips and descriptions. Then he watched it and couldn't stop laughing, so he told me I Had to watch it. We have similar tastes, so I did. I was thoroughly impressed. My first foray into British comedy, and except for the half naked women running around, there wasn't much there to hold my interest. I thought British comedy was pretty bland and unfunny and a bit crude (but not the good kinda crude like Richard Pryor) But this changed my mind. So after seeing all the Bean episodes, I started looking for other things he's been in. So I went into the video store and found black adder, what I didn't know, and the salesperson didn't help me with, is that there are more than one series, and really they should be watched in order. I had bought one of the early years, and one of the wartime years. (the ending to me was rather dramatic for a comedy series, but fit the tone of the show) I have never watched these episodes from start to finish, as I am waiting to get this series (money reasons) I have seen the Christmas Carol (great irony) and the Back and Forth episode, which I loved. I Can't compare it to any ""season"" as i've never watched a full series. But it was great to see Rowan talking, and it was amazing how much of a prickly character he played. Mr. Bean was harmless like a little child, tossed into a grown up world. Black Adder was just downright bitter, and it was fun watching him take so much pleasure in playing the character. After watching this I also watched him in the Thin Blue Line (hopefully that is the right name of it)in which he played a police chief. But, it was black adder that showed his range and his live show (now on dvd) that told me how funny he could be and how british humor could be.  Maybe he is an anomaly lol. Either way this collection is for people who both love Black Adder or anyone who loves  great tv shows. I am rather a tv snob, so it's rare i give any show this kind of reccomendation. But it is one of the classics, but it's still fresh today, not only because of the writing, but since the show takes place in different time periods it rather avoids the ""dated"" problem. Now, remember I have not watched all the episodes, so this review is based on what I have seen. I'm sure anyone who is reading this is already curious as to what Black Adder is and whether or not it's funny, and I just  want to let anyone who is on the borderline that you should buy this and share it without everyone you know, because this is one freaking funny show that should not be missed out on."
936,3.0,"TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship Match: Sarita and Taylor Wilde vs. The Beautiful People (Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky)
No Angelina Love thanks to business issues. DAMN IT! Well, they did the best with what they had I guess. Sarita and Taylor dominated at first with some high-fyling moves, and Sarita even pulled out some unique pins on Sky. However, Sky and Rayne started to wear Sarita down. Sarita and Taylor got the advantage again and Taylor went for a German suplex on Rayne, but Ryane resisted. A poorly executed springboard dropkick from Sarita allowed Taylor to hit the German and bridge it to get the win and become the first ever TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions. Winners: Sarita and Taylor Wilde. Match Rating: 3/5

Grudge Match: Eric Young vs. Hernandez
Why do they do this pretty much every pay-per-view? It's really making me hate Hernandez. Well, Hernandez basically clothesline Eric Young a few times and then shoulder blocked him to the outside. Hernandez threw Young back into the ring and hit the Border Toss for the victory. Yippy skippy. Winner: Hernandez. Match Rating: 2/5

TNA X-Division Championship Match: Samoa Joe (Champion) vs. Daniels
Awesome match! It started out with Joe dominating Daniels, but Daniels regained the advantage using high-flying moves. Joe did ground Joe though by catching him coming off the top ropes with a Rock Bottom! Joe then applied some nerve holds on Daniels. Daniels did manage to fight back though and hit a Suicide Dive on Joe to the outsid! Daniels hurt his knee attempting this though, and Joe took advantage, smashing Daniels's face right into the steel steps! Daniels tried to get back into the ring, but Joe clotheslined the back of Daniels's leg! In the ring, Joe applied an Ankle Lock/leg bar submission hold but Daniels managed to get the ropes. Unrelenting, Joe then applied an STF, but Daniels still managed to get the ropes. Daniels then fought back with a neckbreaker and other power moves. Daniels then went for the BME after hitting an STO on Joe, but Joe rolled out of the way. Daniels DID land on his feet though. Daniels went for the Angel's Wings, but Joe managed to power out of the move. Joe then went for the Muscle Buster, after grounding Daniels with a very unique offensive move focusing on the injured leg, but Daniels fought out of it and went for the Last Rites, but Joe countered and locked in the Coquina Clutch. Daniels tried to fight out of it, but Joe got him on the ground and applied a body scissors to compliment the move, forcing Daniels to tap out. Winner: Samoa Joe. Match Rating: 5/5

Falls Count Anywhere Match: D'Angelo Dinero vs. Suicide
This could have, and should have, been better, but it's still good. Dinero was in the middle of an interview when Suicide ambushed him with a doubler axehandle backstage. They then brawled around in the backstage area, and Dinero took some pretty sick bumps. Suicide back body dropped him into a wheel barrow, and also threw him onto a steel guard railing, which made him land on some concrete. Dinero tried to climb a fence to escape from Suicide, but Suicide pulled Dinero's pants down and yanked him off the fence and onto a pile of wood! They continued to brawl, but Dinero got the advantage. Dinero smashed a cup on Suicide's head and then they fought to the ring. Suicide actually regained the advantage here, but Dinero grounded him with a suplex on the ramp. A table was set up next to the ramp, and Dinero went for a suplex off the ramp through the table, but Suicide actually fought out of it. They then brawled over to the top of the stage where Dinero's attempt at a DDE off the stage on Suicide was countered with a mule kick to the face. Suicide then brought out another table and set it up on the ramp. Suicide's Suicide Solution was blocked, but he did managed to hit a Rolling Hills on the stage onto Dinero. Suicide set Dinero up on the table and climbed onto a ledge above the entrance way and went for a leg drop, but Dinero moved, causing Suicide to crash through the table. Dinero covered Suicide for the win. Winner: D'Angelo Dinero. Match Rating: 4/5

TNA Women's Knockout Championship Match: Cody Deaner vs. ODB
This was a joke match, but it was still pretty damn entertaining. ODB beat the crap out of Cody at first, but the Deaner fought back and manhandled ODB. ODB responded with some strikes, but Deaner grounded her again and then got in the referee's face. The referee then refused to break ODB's pin attempt on Deaner when he got the ropes, and he even helped ODB roll Cody up! Cody did manage to kick out, and then ODB ate Deaner's Knockout Punch! This only got a two count, and Cody then went to the top ropes and started drinking out of ODB's flask! ODB got Cody off the top and hit a TKO to defeat Deaner and officially win the title! Winner: ODB. Match Rating: 4/5

Bounty TNA Legends Championship Match: Kevin Nash (Champion) vs. Abyss
Pretty good, but they got the rules a little bit mixed up and towards the end it became a mess. It started out with Nash and Abyss hitting power moves on each other in the ring, but then the fight spilled to the outside where Abyss tossed Nash into the steel guard rail and the steps. Back in the ring, both Abyss and Nash were going for Chokeslams on each other, but neither could get the other top. Abyss tossed Nash to the ground and then saw Dr. Stevie on the stage sitting in a chair, watching. Abyss turned around and ate a Big Boot from Nash! Stevie distracted the referee and tossed a chair into the ring, which Nash used to smash into Abyss's face. This only earned the two, and this prompted further referee distraction from Stevie. Daffney then ran into the ring with a taser, but Abyss laid her out with an astonishing Black Hole Slam! Nash stopped Abyss from tasering Daffney, but his attempt at the Jackknife Powerbomb was countered by Abyss. Abyss then called for Mick Foley, who was providing guest commentary, to bring him the barbed wire baseball bat! Foley tried to, but Abyss ended up cutting his hand on the barbed wire, and while the referee got Foley away, Nash tasered Abyss's BALLS and then rolled him up! After the match, Stevie refused to pay Nash, so Nash Jackknife Powerbombed him. Winner: Kevin Nash. Match Rating: 4/5

Lethal Lockdown Match: Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) and Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon) vs. The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams) and The Main Event Mafia (Booker T and Scott Steiner)
This match was good, it just didn't live up to expectations. It started with Storm and Magnus, with Storm beating the crap out of Magnus and even hitting the Eye of the Storm. Williams came out next and they double-teamed Storm until Roode entered the match and cleaned house with some unique tag team moves along with Storm. Steiner was in next, and then everything just got confusing. It was madness and random violence until Brother Ray came out. Big Rob ambushed Brother Ray and whacked him in the back with a steel chair and ordered for the roof to be lowered. Ray did regain his posture and then SMASHED a steel chair in Rob's face! Ray then entered the match and ""cleaned house"" with very weak chair shots. Brutus tried to escape to the roof, but Roode and Storm followed, and they hit a double suplex on Brutus on top of the cage. With a crap load of weapons in the ring, with Devon smashing a trashcan lid in people's faces and everyone hitting their finishing moves, it all got really confusing. A highlight was when Ray placed a trashcan on Booker's crotch and then smashed a crutch on it though. The end came when Beer Money hit the DWI on Williams to get the win for their team. Winners: Beer Money, Inc. and Team 3D Match Rating: 4/5

Bobby Lashley vs. Rhino
This was just...okay, I guess. The ending really ruined it. The match started out with power moves, but Rhino grounded Lashley with some submissions. Lashley fought back, but Rhino pushed the referee in the way when Lashley went for the Spear. Rhino then laid Lashley out with the Gore as a new referee came in. This only got a two count though, and then when Rhino went for another Gore, Lashley hit him with a...""Knockout Punch"" for the win. I am not amused. Winner: Bobby Lashley. Match Rating: 3/5

Five Way TNA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. AJ Styles vs. Hernandez vs. Matt Morgan vs. Sting
Hernandez cashed in his Feast or Fired briefcase right before the match began. Anyway, Hernandez dominated Angle out of the ring while the other three men watched. However, when both Angle and Hernandez were out of the ring, AJ and Sting started double-teaming Morgan. Hernandez gave Angle a suplex on the ramp and then went for the Border Toss off THE STAGE, but Eric Young ran out with a baton and smacked Hernandez in the back. Young then gave Hernandez a very poorly executed piledriver on the stage, which caused medics to come out and take Hernandez to the back. Anyway, Morgan tried to get away from Sting and Styles, but they ran out of the ring after him. AJ went for a Suicide Dive on Morgan, but Angle ran in the way to take the shot for Morgan! This renewed their friendship, and Morgan and Angle started working over Sting and Styles together. In the ring, Angle and Morgan double-teamed AJ to the point that AJ rolled out of the ring, but Sting came back in and got the advantage on both men. Sting even hit a freaking missile dropkick on Morgan! Sting then hit the Stinger Splash on Angle and Morgan repeatedly, but Angle fought out of the Scorpion Deathlock. AJ came back into the match and saved Sting from a double-team. Morgan hit the Hellevator on AJ, but Angle broke up the pin and hit the Angle Slam on Morgan. Sting laid Angle out with the Scorpion Death Drop, but Morgan broke up the pin. Morgan hit some of his signature offense on AJ, but while he was on the ring apron, AJ hit him out of nowhere with a Pele Kick! Sting was taken out by an Angle Slam, but AJ attacked Angle and hit the Styles Clash! Morgan broke up the pin, but then Morgan was sent to the outside courtesy of Sting!!! This match is awesome. Angle knocked Sting down and then kept Styles grounded with his usual offense and then went for a Tombstone Piledriver! AJ countered into a Styles Clash attempt, but Angle rolled through with it and locked in the Ankle Lock! Morgan came back into the ring and LAID ANGLE OUT WITH THE CARBON FOOTPRINT! Sting and Styles then worked together to knock Morgan back over the top rope! Sting and AJ stared at each other for a second, but then Sting left the ring and hit a flying clothesline on Morgan off the ring apron to the outside, acknowleding that his wrestling career is coming to a close, and AJ's is just beginning! AJ then hit a springboard 450 Splash on Angle to WIN THE TNA WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP! Winner: AJ Styles. Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
Not the worst pay-per-view ever, but not even close to the best either. It was okay, but some of the matches didn't live up to expectations. The Suicide/Dinero match still wasn't as good as it should be and the Lethal Lockdown Match didn't live up to the hype. The main event was awesome, and Daniels/Joe was awesome, like usual, plus there was some nice storyline progression here and there and some big surprises, but overall, it just wasn't as good as you'd expect."
937,2.0,"As a horror buff, I thought this would be a good rental movie.  I began watching and really liked the early 80's feel.  After about 20 minutes, I started to think about how this movie needs to pick up the pace...  Everyone spoke quietly and nothing was developing.  After an hour, I really started to think, something has to happen soon!  Once I watched 85% of the movie and NOTHING happened, I honestly started to fast forward the DVD.  Up to this point, she is asked by a soft spoken boring man to watch an elderly woman that she is told that she will ""probably never see"".  After their boring conversation is over, he and his wife leave the house.  The main character walks around the dark house, makes a phone call, plays pool, orders pizza, eats pizza, makes a phone call, makes a phone call, walks around more, makes a phone call and that's it.  The house is dark and there is ominous music playing throughout the film...  I'm scared...  Once in a while, you will hear a little sound, but nothing that's alarming.  Frightening...  Like I said, 85% of the movie is what I just described.  There is literally 10 - 15 minutes of action (which could have been MUCH better) at the end and the movie concludes with a predictable and clich ending.  If you are going to make people scotch tape their eyelids open to get through this painfully lame movie, at least make the freaking ending worth the viewer's time and effort!!!  Think about this once you finish the movie.  If I muted the TV and watched this movie until the last 15 minutes of the movie, would I be scared in the least bit?  Or, if I just turned the TV off and did something else, would I have been better off?  The answers are No and Yes!  Save yourselves time and money and stay away from this movie!"
938,4.0,"Season four of ""Jonathan Creek"" sees a change in the central dynamic of the show. With the departure of Maddy Magellan (Caroline Quentin) for America, Jonathan is teamed up with television presenter Carla Borrego (Julia Sawahla), first introduced in the Christmas Special&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Satan-s-Chimney/dp/B000T2USME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Satan's Chimney</a>. Now married to producer Brendan Baxter (Adrian Edmonson), she's rather displeased by Jonathan's reappearance in her life, especially when her husband becomes enamored by his mental acuity. Against their will they're made the presenters of a new crime-show that purports to solve seemingly impossible crimes, with Carla's onscreen persona backed up by Jonathan's puzzle-solving prowess.

The change from Maddy's book-writing to Carla's television-presenting gives writer David Renwick the chance to poke fun at the disingenuous nature of TV broadcasting, touching on everything from dishonest editing to ratings grabs to appealing to the lowest common denominator. Jonathan moves through various stages of disgust at the publicity tactics, gross materialism and general sordidness of the industry, whether he's seeing a hound-dog dressed as Sherlock Holmes, the reenactment of a brutal murder for television, or a bunch of wannabe celebrities wallowing about in a pig-sty for ratings.

But of course, there are still the mysteries! The basis of this entire series has always been the truly mind-bending mysteries that Jonathan has so solve, where people are murdered or artefacts disappear in baffling ways.

""The Coonskin Cap"" involves a serial killer on the loose in London, targeting young women with floral-themed names. Carla and Brendan are eager to milk the situation for all its worth, bringing in Inspector Ted Parnevik for an interview on their new show ""Eyes and Ears"". But when the Inspector's college (and lover) Heather Davis is killed in an empty gym, no one can fathom how the killer managed to escape.

""Angel Hair"" is a somewhat unique episode given that no real crime takes place during its length. Dudley Houseman is a rather dissatisfied husband, married to the beautiful Sally Ellen Oakley, but only attracted to her pop-star persona. An affair is imminent, but things take a turn for the weird when a videotape of his mistress is discovered, apparently the victim of a kidnapping. Yet Dudley can't fathom how she managed to grow her hair back in such a short space of time - though the kidnappers cut it all off in the videotape, he knows that she had a full head of hair when he was with her earlier in the day.

Yeah, the stakes aren't particularly high for this one, but it's a fun little ""lite"" mystery that's backed up with a subplot involving Jonathan dating a woman who seems to be using him as a replacement for her recently-deceased cocker spaniel.

In ""The Tailor's Dummy"" legendary fashion designer Marco Bergman commits suicide by throwing himself out of an upstairs window. At least that's what everyone assumes: his children and niece were eye-witnesses, but Jonathan can't understand why on earth the man would throw his parrot out of the window before taking the leap himself. He thinks it's murder, but is having trouble figuring out how.

""The Seer of the Sands"" has an American business woman arrive on a small coastal town to grieve the loss of her boyfriend Justin Mallory, who recently died in a boating accident. She can't understand why a fax sent from her, declaring that her husband would soon agree to a divorce, could upset her boyfriend so much that he would get drunk and crash his boat. The mystery deepens when a gypsy woman offers to answer five questions from Justin, only to uncover a bottle buried in the sand beneath her that contains the answers she seeks. Jonathan is certain the whole thing is a set-up, but has trouble convincing everyone else.

""The Chequered Box"" is probably the most straightforward case this show has ever had; so much so that it's easy enough to figure out the mystery as it's actually happening. Respected officer Inspector Fell has been caught on camera at a murder scene, wiping fingerprints and sneering at a dead body. He insists that he's innocent, and Jonathan believes him - though it's hard to argue with the evidence.

Finally, ""Gorgon's Wood"" is simultaneously the best and most frustrating episode on this DVD set. That is to say, the first half is one of the most elegant mysteries this show has ever had, dealing with the disappearance of a stone figurine from a small museum. The second half goes off the rails a bit, with the mystery veering off into new territory that involves the unlikely scenario of a lookalike. It's one of my favorites, yet I can't help but wish it had a different resolution.

Although this season is entertaining throughout, it's clear that David Renwick is running low on ideas. The mysteries are still baffling, but there are two things that mark out these episodes from previous ones: a tendency to split the mystery into two distinct puzzles (""The Tailor's Dummy"" for example not only deals with Marco Bergman's suicide, but also a subplot involving a journalist being attacked in her hotel room that's only tangentially related to the main crime), and a sense that the run-time is being padded out with lengthy comedic subplots (as well as Brendan Baxter, Jonathan Creek's boss obnoxious boss Adam Klaus is another comedic foil).

There are also some strange elements that are introduced only to be completely dropped. In one episode Carla finds out that her husband was once married to a man - after initially freaking out, the storyline is dropped and never brought up again. In another, comedian guest-star Bill Bailey returns as terrible magician Lenny Starkiss, who finds himself caught up in a kidnapping ring. This ends on a cliff-hanger with Lenny being carted off by moss-bosses and is never resolved. It's...pretty weird.

So the quality isn't quite as good as in previous seasons, and Maddy is sorely missed. Carla may not be as outrageous as Maddy, but she's also not as lovable (say what you will about Maddy's sometimes b*tchy personality; she still had a social conscious and would write out of a commitment to seeing justice done). Carla is more interested in her career and has a slightly colder personality - of course, there's nothing wrong with either of those things, but she's less fun to watch and her dynamic with Jonathan not as interesting.

After this ""Jonathan Creek"" more or less came to an end: though there were three more Christmas/Easter special and a three-episode season five, the quality dipped dramatically. It's a shame, but I loved ""Jonathan Creek"" while it lasted, and though it went out more with a whimper than a bang, I'm still grateful for the ingenuity and humor of its initial run."
939,1.0,"what a pretentious load of $#!+  !!!
WOW, these people are so great, so important, & so much better than you. It is incredible: the arrogance of these people. They think that the world would stop without them. They are so smart; there is nothing they don't know. They work harder than anyone. They are more imaginative. They immerse themselves in some sort of long-lost aesthetic. ""they way I approach photograhpy is spontaneous"". well, whooppdy-freaking-doo for you.

I want my money back.

in fact, I think someone owes me a few million dollars for pain & suffering.

I can't stand it. seriously. I'm going to cut these discs into a million pieces throw them into a toilet that has just been used for some #1 & #2 action, & I will call it art & that piece will be featured in the next installment of this series, & they will interview me, & I can talk about how inspired I was & how important I am."
940,5.0,What a great twist on the zombie genre!  This movie takes freaking out to a whole new level as it paints you a picture with words as to the terror engulfing the world around them.  Excellent show!
941,3.0,"my title says it all..........I liked the premise. Good story line with some promising subplots..hated hated hated the editing sytle of 4 frames of the monsters and back to the actors BS. JUST ABSOLUTELY WANTED TO PUT MY FOOT RIGHT UP THE EDITORS BACKSIDE. And smack the back of the head of the exec producer too.  You had the hard part of this project done - a script that works - and actors who can do some acting - couldn't you guys just try a tiny weeny bit more and not rush the third act so fast you killed all story lines and subplots (likely in a single evening) ?

must be one of those shot and posted in the eastern block productions...........did I mention I absolutely freaking HATED the 4 frames shots of the ""monsters""..........

starts out 4 stars, then left turns into 2 star land........hence 3 stars....."
942,5.0,It Might Get Loud featuring Jack White - Jimmy Page & The Edge is with doubt a must have in your DVD collection if you play the guitar. I thought to myself how freaking cool it would be to have been a fly on the wall when this film was shot. I love the opening with Jack White as he puts together a one string slide guitar and he plays to a field of cows priceless. Then there's the discovery of how to play classic Led Zeppelin songs. I love the part where Jimmy Page pays homage to Link Wray. Not to be left out The Edge shares some of his guitar parts that gave U-2 it's over all sound. I highly recommend this DVD - Colorado Rick
943,1.0,"This movie is about a serial killer with multiple personalities who gets caught. Wait...No, it's about a group of friends who include a weirdo, his best buddy, a blind black kid who gets around everywhere in the town without a seeing eye dog and who is really Forest Whittaker's son, and several other teenagers who were born on the same day as the killer who may all be killers themselves (??). Darn...that's not right either...OK. This movie is really about a boy who is mentally disturbed and has a weird penchant for dressing up like a condor bird and freaking other people out for no reason.

Actually, I give up...I went to see this at the movie theatre. The film was shown in the smallest room at the darkest end of the emptiest theatre hallway. The movie itself was so incredibly insignificant that the theatre people didn't bother to put the sign up at the door to even let us know that we were in the right room. After that, the movie started and people began to get up and leave, one by one until it was just me and my best friend. My friend and I suspected that we were fools for staying, yet once we realized the movie was never going to make any sense it was too late....One week later the movie was no longer featured at any movie cinema in the U.S., but the worst thing is this: I still have no clue what it was about!"
944,5.0,"I like Ruby Beh's work and would pretty much recommend any of her DVDs, but this DVD is a must have if you want to do floorwork.  She breaks everything down so well, so easily, and so gracefully.  I love it.

This DVD is wonderful and I'm all about it, but two things I tend to disagree with: number one, she does these movements on a smooth floor, so you might want to watch it in the kitchen if you can (carpet can be a problem for some of the moves), and number 2: I'm a HUGE fan of knee pads.  I get the whole, dancing in your outfit and doing these moves the way you would perform them - but freaking perform them in opaque genie pants and wear knee pads!

That said, you can't beat this DVD for floor moves!"
945,4.0,"I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Bridal Fever was pretty good. There were a few utterances of mild crude language, use of alcohol, low cut tops and strapless dresses seen occasionally on women.  There were also suggestive images on several romance novels in the bookstore.  The theme is a little more mature, as it has to do a lot with dating and divorce.  I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again.  There were several parts that I thought could have been better, but all it was entertaining.

I didn't like the fact that everyone seemed to think that getting married was all that mattered.  If you are single and beautiful, then there is no reason on earth why you shouldn't be married.  You don't have have anything in common with the guy or even love him.  All you have to do is ""seal the deal""...luckily Gwen eventually realizes this is wrong and marries the guy of her choice.

I also thought that Gwen's friend, Sandra, was mean at the end.  At the beginning of the movie she is freaking out because she and Gwen are the last two unmarried friends from school.  At each wedding, the brides have had all the single girls stand/sit down in front when the picture was taken.  Because Sandra talked Gwen out of dating the guy of her choice, simply because he wouldn't talk about his views on marriage and children on the first date, Gwen is therefore is the last one to get married.  So at Sandra's wedding she still makes Gwen stand alone in front of all the other Saint Mary's girls.  Some friend.

Despite these two things, as I said, I would watch this movie again.  It was funny and fairly clean."
946,5.0,"It's rare at the moment to see a science fiction movie that isn't a remake, a cash-in, an adaptation, or a spinoff of another big success.

But ""District 9"" is not that kind of movie. Instead, the rarest kind of film -- a unique and original idea, handled in an intelligent manner, with no big name actors or flashy special effects. Director Neill Blomkamp instead creates a truly captivating sci-fi movie -- and by inverting the whole alien-invasion trope, Blomkamp also forces his audience to think. Hard.

Almost thirty years ago, an alien ship appeared over South Africa -- but it brought neither global destruction or salvation. When soldiers cut their way in, they found starving refugees who are now nicknamed ""prawns.""

Currently the aliens live as outcasts in District 9 while nations argue over them, and the company Multi-National United is selected to make their weapons work... which is not possible, because only alien DNA can activate them. Then during forced evictions of District 9, a typically callous MNU field operative named Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) accidently sprays himself with a black alien fluid in a little lab. Unfortunately, it starts turning him into one of the aliens.

Unsurprisingly, the MNU wants the secrets of Wikus' changing body, and the corporation is not terribly picky about how they get it. He manages to escape into the only place where he has a chance of surviving -- the very alien slum that he was trying to empty, District 9. And his only chance of surviving and becoming human again lies with an alien scientist who is trying to reactive the hovering ""prawn"" mothership.

Segregation. Blatant discrimination (including a racist nickname). Poverty. Shanty towns. Large companies and countries who care nothing for the despised minority population. It's painfully clear what would probably happen if spooky insectile aliens were to land on humanity's doorstep -- and Neill Blomkamp pulls no punches in his allegorical examination of apartheid, alien-style -- with the poor ""prawns"" as the universal victims. It's a hard, gruesome story with painfully graphic violence (Wikus gleefully bombs alien eggs) but it really needs to be that way.

Blomkamp also presents his story in a unique way -- much of it is filmed like a documentary, though thankfully it has none of the sickmaking shakiness of movies like ""Cloverfield"" or ""The Blair Witch Project."" There are plenty of spliced interviews, documentaries and news footage, which are cloaked in a feeling of gritty, dusty realism -- the dark industrial mothership with its slimy interior, the dusty slum, and the poor aliens who basically scavenge through garbage to survive.

But the last quarter of the movie also evolves it into a slam-bang explosion-riddled action flick, without losing its focus -- there are some brilliantly gruesome scenes where the aliens turn against some human attackers, and Wikus even gets to kick butt anime-style in an alien battle-suit. If there's a flaw with this movie, it's the whole idea that humans wouldn't be at all afraid of aliens who are clearly technologically superior to us -- they have a freaking SPACESHIP that's been sitting over Johannesburg for thirty years!

It also has the virtue of the most alien aliens seen in ages -- they move, look, speak (click click!) and think nothing like humans, and they're slimy and kinda creepy looking. They have no grandiose plans or pretty sparkly technology. Yet Blomkamp infuses them with a sense of nobility and strength, and despite their insectile faces he makes you feel what they do after awhile.

It's hard to believe that this is Sharlto Copley's first acting role, because his performance is so strong: Wikus is a pretty despicable human being, who has fun killing aliens and ejecting them from their homes. It takes a physical transformation into an ""other"" to change his spirit as well. And Blomkamp lets us see the pain of his transition even when we don't like him (including a heartrending phone call to his wife). The supporting actors also provide excellent lesser performances, but Copley rules this one.

As for the single-disc DVD... well, it's pretty skimpy, honestly. It will have a director's commentary by Blomkamp, which is pretty much guaranteed to be awesome -- I would love to see how he conjured the aliens and their hovering ship. There's also the ""Koobus Big Gun"" featurette, a three part ""Filmmaker's Log,"" and a sequel log called ""Refining District 9."" The downside: The original short film ""Alive in Joburg"" that this movie stems from is NOT included. I don't know why -- it's certainly short enough to fit.

""District 9"" is a brilliantly original, hard-hitting movie that wraps a timeless human failing in an alien skin. It's one of the best movies of the year thus far, and certainly a classic in the making."
947,3.0,"I continue to look back at the reviews from some of the main critics on this movie, to make sure I viewed the same film.  The film was just trashed by most people and I admittedly only saw it because it was on my cable premium channel for free.  I figured I had some time to kill; the girlfriend always likes Sandra Bullock movies, so why not give it a shot.  I still had my scotch in hand if things got too bad.  Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed the film quite a bit.  I am still unsure what all of the fuss was about.

Sandra Bullock holds down a job as a cross word puzzle constructor.  I will say the movie does not paint this occupation in a good light.  Are all the people who hold down this job really that quirky?  She is an extremely intelligent person, and we could call her unique as well.  Damn, if I am straight with you, she reminded me of a couple creepy girls from college.  One girl actually tracked me down at my house after one date.  I still don't know how she found out where I lived.

Sandra lives at home with her parents and she talks a lot.  I mean she talks all of the time.  I live in a house with my girlfriend and three daughters and all of them combined do not talk that much.  Well, maybe all of the combined.  Despite all of Sandra's social issues, she has a good heart, but just hasn't found the right guy yet.  Her mother sets her up on a blind date, with Bradley Cooper of all people and she likes him so much she tries to do him in the back of his SUV, right outside of her parent's house.  The sentimental occasion gets broken up by his job calling, but he inadvertently suggests he might enjoy seeing her on the road at his next assignment.  He is the cameraman for a news team.

Crazy Sandra takes this to heart and starts stalking, I mean following him like a groupie.  At one point he really starts freaking out about the whole thing.  I loved Thomas Haden Church's character and how he encouraged her to keep up her unnatural pursuits.  Church was absolutely hilarious, even if he played his typical dry sense of humor character he has honed to a science.  As with all good romantic comedies, we find out Sandra might be crazy, but she is a truly good person, and her endearing qualities win over the crowd, if not the boy of her dreams.
I should make a note here.  It is getting extremely hard to watch a movie with Bradley Cooper in my house.  If I have to hear how hot he is from my girlfriend one more time. I might jump out of our first floor window.  Hey, I might find it annoying, but I don't want to hurt myself over it.  The girlfriend's friend was over a few nights ago, and we had her watch ""The Hangover"".  She had not seen it.  OMG, it was nonstop drooling over the guy.  Anyway, back to our main story.

I enjoyed the movie.  It wasn't a stellar theatrical production, but it holds its own and you have several laughs in the process as well.  I still have no idea what movie some of the major critics were watching.  But from my humble perspective, you could do far worse than sitting on the couch with a bowl of popcorn watching Sandra Bullock drive Bradley Cooper absolutely bonkers with her hilariously funny, if not sometimes crazy, antics.  Damn, I almost forgot, I love those red boots."

949,5.0,"Since the theatrical release of this movie, I have had plenty of time to anticipate its Blu Ray release. I never saw it in theaters and took in all the reviews and opinions over the past few months. I love horror movies, so I knew I would see it at some point, but I was careful not to believe all the hype, and took a more ""wait and see"" kind of approach. I just got the blu-ray version of this film for Christmas and watched it a little while ago, my first horror movie for the new year. Honestly, it was thoroughly entertaining and creepy throughout the movie, the best and scariest part being the last few minutes of the film. I also watched the alternate ending. I guess if I had to decide which ending I liked better, I would have to go with the theatrical version, but the alternate was very eerie as well. I do not feel as those who find themselves unable to sleep for weeks after seeing this film, but I can see myself looking over my shoulder at times. I am 51 years old, and have loved horror films since I was a young boy. But, putting it in perspective, I remember freaking out watching an episode the Twilight Zone back in the 60s and being unable to sleep that night. I think the younger crowd, for the most part, would be most frightened by ""Paranormal Activity"" and us older folks are more frightened by day-to-day events in the world than by a movie. Suffice it to say, I thought it was worth watching and should give you a few jolts, probably many more jolts if you are younger. Some people told me it was boring, which I did not find. It kept my attention from start to finish. The blu-ray transfer seemed fine, given the way it was filmed. I have no complaints in that department. So, if you haven't seen it already, and if you are at least curious, you might want to check it out, at least to see where your opinion fits in among all the others. If 2010 is no scarier than this movie, it will be a great year!"
950,5.0,"PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

STARRING: Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat and Mark Fredrichs

WRITTEN BY: Oren Peli

DIRECTED BY: Oren Peli

Rated: R
Genre: Horror
Release Date: 16 October 2009

Several movie advertisements have used this line for years and I have never found it to be even remotely true until now; so I'm going to use it: Paranormal Activity is the scariest film since The Exorcist. There, I've finally been able to use it!

Now that I have your attention, let me save half of you the three minutes that it will take you to finish reading this review and the roughly 90 it'll save you from actually watching the film. If you hated The Blair Witch Project because you thought it was stupid, then you will inevitably despise this film as well. There. See how nice of a guy I am? Now you can spend those 90 minutes doing something you enjoy.

For those of you still reading, I will take it that you appreciated the brilliant and unique style of The Blair Witch Project, as did I. You will most likely love this film as well.

The Blair Witch Project clearly inspired this film, as it has others and was a slightly better film. But Paranormal Activity is easily 10 times more frightening.

I'm told its entire budget was just 15 thousand dollars and it has already grossed over 100 million dollars at the box office.

NO; regardless of what you have heard, the film is not real. Neither was The Blair Witch Project or Quarantine or The Fourth Kind.

The film looks and feels real though, and that's why it's so terrifying. We are lead to believe that it is `found footage' by the police and that for whatever reason, they are allowing it to be released in theaters nation-wide.

The entire thing is shot with a home video camera, operated completely by the two main characters: Katie and Micah. They're a couple with a little more than a lump in the mattress causing problems in their relationship; a demon to be exact.

We learn in the first few minutes that for several nights they have witnessed strange `paranormal activity' occurring while they sleep. Micah buys the video camera and explains this to us as we meet Katie when she pulls up in their driveway. We follow them back into the house and with the exception of a scene in the backyard; we never leave the home again for the remainder of the film.

It is soon revealed that Katie has been haunted by this demonic spirit for several years, no matter where she goes. They agree to set up the video camera in their bedroom in hopes of capturing evidence of such said `paranormal activity'.

That's when it gets creepy. The camera is positioned in the same place every night and a little time dial lets us know what time it is. Every time you see the camera positioned in the corner of the room like that, you know it's about to get scary. And it does, trust me.

At first we just hear noises. Then the door moves all by itself. Then we start to see shadows and that's all I'm going to tell you.

This is not one of those movies that you will think is just so-so. You will either love it or you will hate it. You will either find it incredibly horrifying; leaving to your imagination what is causing all of this to happen or you will be completely irritated at how lame it is.

I think it is much more fun to leave it up to your imagination what the demon looks like. Yes; I know that it is just a guy downstairs making noise and turning on lights and what have you. But it's freaking scary in the movie! You let your mind believe that it's a demon and that's what makes it so fun.

The actors don't seem like actors. They feel like real people being themselves on a reality show. When the events begin to take a toll on them and they become scared, you believe that they are going through this for real. (Not literally; I mean you believe their acting performances. It's a movie people; that's all).

The only reason it's not a prefect film, is that just like in any horror movie; the characters do stupid things. Especially Micah.

You will want to strangle him by the end of the film. He is constantly being a testosterone-driven moron and challenging the demon; thus making it angrier.

Also, why didn't they ever leave the house? It's explained by a paranormal expert that leaving won't help anything but it's very obvious this is only in the movie because they wanted an excuse to be able to continue shooting in the same location.

When the paranormal expert won't help them due to the overwhelming evil presence in the house, why couldn't they have called in someone else? I'm sure he wasn't the only one around.

Regardless if you get slightly annoyed by this towards the end of the film like I did, they make it up to you in the last 20 minutes or so. Most of the film drags on and I can see how it can be boring. But trust me, if you can make it to the end you will be more than satisfied!

It is truly disturbing. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Every time they go to bed and you see the little time dial, it's like listening to the tick tack of a roller coaster climbing to the top of the track; you know that something awful but exciting lies just ahead and you can't help but cringe and your heart is racing.

I know the film is fake but I am still amazed at how they were able to pull off some of the events that take place. There are no wires folks; there are no obvious bad computer graphics either. The filmmakers took their 15 grand and spent it very wisely. I'm glad to have given them my money. It was the best 7 bucks I've spent to be scared in a very long time."
951,5.0,"Ladder ECW Championship Match: Christian (Champion) vs. Shelton Benjamin
They started the match out like a regular match, using some of their regular moves. When the fight spilled to the outside after Shelton hit the springboard forearm smash, they started using the security barricade. They ended up back in the ring, along with a ladder, but Christian sent Benjamin to the outside. Christian approached the ropes, holding the ladder, but Shelton grabbed his foot and tripped him, having the ladder fall on Christian's face and busting his eye open! On the outside, Benjamin set a ladder up like a bridge between the announce table and the ring. Shelton then flipped off the 20-foot ladder onto the recovering Christian on the outside!!! Benjamin then tried to suplex Christian on the ladder bridge, but Christian countered and tried to throw Benjamin into the ladder. Benjamin slid under the ladder though and dragged Christian under it. Benjamin tried for a slingshot, but Christian pushed him back and he ran into a ladder behind him! The fight went back into the ring, and Christian and Benjamin repeatedly tried to reach the title suspended above the ring, but they kept knocking the other off. Christian hit a Reverse DDT off the ladder and Benjamin hit an astonishing powerslam off the ladder! They used the ladder in some unique ways against one another, with Benjamin tipping the ladder over on purpose to hit an assisted clothesline on Christian on the way down! However, they both started to climb the ladder again, but Benjamin went for a sunset flip powerbomb off the ladder! Benjamin landed on his feet on accident though and Christian took advantage with a hurracanrana that sent Benjamin face-first into the second turnbuckle! They then started to battle on the apron where Benjamin tried to German suplex Christian through the ladder bridge! Christian battled out though and caught Benjamin with two boots to the face through the ropes! Benjamin landed on the ladder and Christian went to the top ropes! Christian hit a Frog Splash off the top and onto Benjamin, sending him THROUGH the ladder! Christina then climbed the ladder and retained his championship! Winner: Christian. Match Rating: 5/5

Intercontinental Championship Match: John Morrison (Champion) vs. Drew McIntyre
Morrison started the match on time with a slew of high-flying moves and strikes. Morrison caught McIntyre with a shoulder to the gut while on the apron and hit a springboard hurracanrna on McIntyre followed by a running knee to the back of Drew's head! The fight then spilled to the outside. Morrison hit a Chuck Kick off the apron and on the outside on McIntyre! Morrison charged McIntyre only to get tossed into the steel ring post when he tried for a hurracanrana. McIntyre then rolled Morrison back into the ring where he maintained the advantage with quick pins and some basic submission holds. Morrison was compromised like this for a while, but Morrison came back with a brilliant missile dropkick on McIntyre. McIntyre then hit a big time clothesline on Morrison and charged him in the corner, but Morrison moved out of the way and McIntyre's shoulder caught the steel ring post! Morrison then hit the Starship Pain on McIntyre, but his foot was under the bottom rope! Morrison kept the attack on McIntyre though with stiff kicks to the head. Morrison took off his belt and was about to use it as a weapon, but decided against it and tossed it to the mat. As the referee was taking care of the belt, Drew jabbed Morrison in the eyes! Drew then tried for the Double-Arm DDT, but Morrison tried to battle out. His efforts were futile, and Drew hit the move and PINNED Morrison to become the new Intercontinental Champion! Winner: Drew McIntyre. Match Rating: 5/5

Women's Championship Match: Michelle McCool (Champion) (with Layla) vs. Mickie James
Mark my words, Michelle McCool is going to go down as one of the best women wrestlers of all time. The match was a standard match at first, but James exploded with a ton of quick pins and some stiff shots. McCool fought back with her own type of slow, submission offense, but James powered out of her submissions. McCool slid Mickie into the steel ring post, and then the fight spilled to the outside. Layla almost accidentally got McCool disqualified by attacking James, but the referee stopped her. McCool tried for a running knee on James while her head was resting against the security barricade, but James moved out of the way. James then hit a freaking hurracanrana off the security barricade and on the outside on McCool! James brought the fight back into the ring, but when James tried going to the top ropes, Layla yanked on her leg! James jumped down to attack Layla, but McCool charged James with a big boot. James dodged it, it nailed Layla, and then James rolled up McCool. McCool kicked out though and caught James with a big boot to win the match. Winner: Michelle McCool. Match Rating: 4/5

Tables WWE Championship Match: John Cena (Champion) vs. Sheamus
Sheamus was dominated by John Cena at the beginning of the match, who hit a series of shoulderblocks and a big-time bulldog. Sheamus rolled to the outside to flee, but John Cena maintained the advantage by throwing Sheamus into the steel steps. Cena set a table up at ringside, but then Sheamus regained the advantage and rolled Cena back into the ring. Sheamus tried to knock Cena through the table set up on the outside but failed to do so. Cena tried to knock Sheamus through the table, but he too failed. Sheamus took Cena out with the Irish Curse, which is the name of the Bicycle Kick he uses, and then tried to suplex Cena on the ramp. Cena countered and suplexed Sheamus. Cena tried to smash Sheamus with a table while he was lying on the ramp, but Sheamus rolled out of the way and fled through the crowd. Cena followed in hot pursuit and then clotheslined Sheamus back to ringside. Cena set up a new table in the ring, but Sheamus regained the advantage after countering the Attitude Adjustment and tried to Spinebuster Sheamus through a table set up in the corner. Cena countered and hit a series of shoulderblocks and his spinning back suplex on Sheamus. Cena prepared to throw Cena through the table he had set up in the corner, but Sheamus wisely dumped it to the outside before Cena could do anything. Cena continued the attack and connected with the Five Knuckle Shuffle as well as the Attitude Adjustment! Cena set up yet another table in the ring and tried to hit a Super Attitude Adjustment on Sheamus through the table, but Sheamus powered out. Cena then tried for a superplex, but suddenly lost his balance and both Sheamus and Cena fell off the top! Cena fell through the table though and lost his title! Winner: Sheamus. Match Rating: 5/5

Chairs World Heavyweight Championship Match: The Undertaker (Champion) vs. Batista
At the beginning of the match Batista and Undertaker used chairs rather poorly. The battle spilled to the outside and Undertaker missed a knee in the security barricade. Batista smacked Undertaker in the back pretty weakly with a steel chair. In the ring, Batista set a chair up in the corner and tried to use it, but Undertaker countered. Undertaker then went on a roll, connecting with Snake Eyes and Old School, but Batista caught him with a surprise Spear! Undertaker kicked out, but Batista kept attacking him with the chair. Batista tried for the Batista Bomb on top of the chair, but Undertaker countered. Batista hit a Spinebuster, but Undertaker kicked out. Batista then hit a Spinebuster on Undertaker ON a steel chair, but Undertaker still kicked out. Batista tried for a Spear, but Undertaker moved and Batista hit his head on the steel chair in the corner. Undertaker connected with a Chokeslam and tried for the Tombstone, but Batista countered and pushed Batista into the referee. Batista then hit Undertaker in the sack and followed it up with a steel chair shot to pin Undertaker. Theodore Long came out though and ordered the match restarted because Batista broke the rules, which gave Undertaker the chance to hit Batista with some weak chair shots and connect with the Tombstone Piledriver to officially retain his title. Winner: The Undertaker. Match Rating: 4/5

Kofi Kingston vs. Randy Orton
Kingston took it to Orton early, hitting a series of high impact moves in quick succession. Orton tried to flee to the outside, but Kingston followed him. Kingston then ran up the steps and onto the top ropes, but when he tried to spin around and go for a flying crossbody, Orton met him with a high dropkick on the OUTSIDE right to the gut! Orton then started to dissect Kofi in the ring, with stomps and basic submissions. Orton then taunted Kofi and watched as he pulled himself up, but Kofi exploded with the S.O.S.! Orton kicked out, but Kofi then hit the Boom Drop, and prepared for the Trouble in Paradise, which connected! Orton grabbed the bottom rope at the last second to break the count, and then caught Kofi off-guard with a modified backbreaker. Orton then tried for the RKO, but Kofi countered with a backslide that nearly won him the match! Orton tried to retreat again, but Kofi hit him with a Suicide Dive! Kofi rolled Orton back into the ring, but as Kofi was getting into the ring, Orton nailed him with the second-story DDT! Orton then tried for the Concussion Punt, but Kofi blocked it with his arm! It still hurt Kofi's arm significantly though, and Orton realized it. Orton then hit an offensive move to focus on Kofi's arm, dodged a desperate Trouble in Paradise attempt, and then hit the RKO to pin Kofi! Winner: Randy Orton. Match Rating: 5/5

TLC Unified WWE Tag Team Championships Match: Jeri-Show (Chris Jericho and The Big Show) (Champions) vs. D-Generation X (Shawn Michaels and Triple H)
Big Show and Triple H started brawling on the outside of the ring, with Triple H taking Big Show over the barricade with a clothesline and then setting a table up diagonally. In the ring, Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels performed their usual moves. Jericho tried for the Walls of Jericho, but Michaels spun out of the move and hit a series of atomic drops and scoop slams. Michaels tried for the Flying Elbow Drop, but Jericho blocked it with his knees! Triple H and Big Show made their way to the top of the ramp. Triple H had the advantage by using a steel chair, but Jericho ran up and attacked him in the back with a chair of his own. Triple H attacked and tried for the Pedigree, but Jericho countered and back body dropped Triple H on the steel ramp. Michaels then ran to make the save. He disappeared into the backstage area and returned with a steel chair! Michaels and Jericho had a fight with the chairs with Michaels coming out on top. Michaels then dragged Jericho back to ringside where they battled some more, but Jericho regained the advantage here and set up a table. Jericho and Michaels kept trying to put each other through the table, but failed. Both teams then tried to use ladders to reach the belts, but they kept knocking it down and taking people off the ladders in unique ways. Big Show got whacked right in the back of the head with the ladder and DX worked in tandem to essentially suplex a ladder right onto Jericho's back. Shawn tried for the Sweet Chin Music on Jericho, but Jericho ducked the attack and hit the Codebreaker. Triple H caught Jericho with the Pedigree, but turned around to a Spear! Big Show tried to climb the ladder, but he ate a chair to the back from Triple H. Big Show responded with a Knockout Punch into the face of Triple H! Shawn and Jericho started climbing a ladder, but Jericho jumped down and tipped it over, which inadvertently sent Shawn into a flying crossbody to the outside on Big Show. Big Show and Jericho then had the clear advantage over DX, using the ladder to smash them in between it. Big Show then RIPPED a ladder in half! Big Show took Triple H and Shawn Michaels to the outside where Big Show Chokeslammed Shawn onto Triple H and through the table Triple H set up earlier! Jericho tried to climb the broken ladder, but failed obviously. Jericho then instructed Show to let him stand on his shoulders to try to grab the belts. DX recovered though and Big Show was defenseless as a result! Shawn caught Big Show with a Sweet Chin Music, which made him dump Jericho to the outside and smack his face on the table he set up earlier! Shawn hit Big Show with ANOTHER Sweet Chin Music, followed by a Pedigree from Triple H! Shawn and Triple H then used the broken ladder to clothesline Big Show to the outside, and then Triple H held up the half of a ladder so Shawn could climb it and pull down the belts! Winners: D-Generation X. Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
Awesome, awesome show. Everyone gave great performances. All of the matches were very entertaining and there was a lot of twists and shockers sprinkled throughout the entire program. A couple of the matches were weaker than they should have been, and the concept of a ""Chairs"" match is pretty lame, but overall the show was PHENOMENAL. Probably the best wrestling pay-per-view of the entirety of 2009. Sheamus is the WWE Champion. Yeah, no joke. There were hardly any promos to speak of though, and that was a bit of a letdown."
952,1.0,I only got through 30 minutes of this before I had to shut it off.  It was freaking awful.  The acting was so wooden that it was painful to watch.  I like Jack Black but this was just a horrid film.
953,3.0,"Piranha 3D is a very simple movie, boobs alcohol parting and piranha's, pretty simple formula here that harkens back to the good ol' 70's and 80's exploitation flicks. So we have Christopher Lloyd gloriously overacting, Jerry O'Connell playing a huge loveable A-hole (with a very gruesome death), Ving Rhames playing his usual badass self (putting a boat propeller to good use), and Elizabeth Shue playing concerned mother/cop.

Seems like a fun dumb time right? Wrong! Elizabeth Shue has a teenage son and two even YOUNGER little brats, and so much time is focused on these stupid children that it feels like the centerpiece for the film that's called PIRANHA 3D! So we see the teen run into Jerry O'Connell's Girls Gon-sorry, Wild Wild Girls character and they take the whiny puss in so he can show them the good spots around the lake. So the whole time the Wild Wild Girls crew is having a blast the kid is acting like a freaking goth sulking around in the corner and basically adding the suck factor to this movie. But don't worry it gets worse.

Meanwhile the two even younger brats for some reason get stranded on some island in the lake, and that's when you really feel your full money's worth for PIRANHA 3D when you watch two kids squabbling with each other on an island. See the main problem with the kids besides the fact that they're always horrible actors is that in movies like these there's absolutely 0 tension in it. We can see a bunch of teens on spring break get killed violently but if they're wittle childwen then suddenly it's too disturbing for modern audiences. I may just be a sick f*** but if I got to see both of the little kids getting torn to shreds underwater with a look of extreme pain and terror on their faces I would've been dying of laughter in the theater; maybe in the future that'll happen in a big budget horror movie sometime but in the meantime we have to choke down kids being shoehorned into the movie for no reason.

So that's all that really bothered me about Piranha 3D, it seems like a small thing but you'd be suprised in how the screenwriters manage to shove these stupid kids into a script that really should have no place for kids. The teen himself wouldn't have been so bad if he didn't have any siblings and was just looking out for the girl he had a crush on.

Also on a side note *spoilers* WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU SHOW THE LAST SCENE OF THE MOVIE IN THE TRAILER!?!?? While it's not as offensively bad as Quarantine which in all it's wisdom put THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE ON THE POSTER, it's still an awful decision. That's how I'll remember Piranha 3D, a very nice and simple premise hampered down by a few really stupid decisions."

Review Date: 29 August 2010

Piranha doesn't disappoint! And how could it? What expectations could you possibly have of it, that couldn't be satisfied? If you have any such expectations - they are unreasonably high. I'll point out again, that it's called Piranha, okay?

Based on Piranha's poster (which proudly displays a hot babe sunbathing on an inflatable raft, while a school of deadly piranha emerge from below), you go to see a movie like this for only two reasons: to see naked flesh and to see blood.

Surely the extras were instructed they need only bring one thing with them to the shoot, between the two sexes (both involving numbers; six packs and two pieces! While the film unfortunately yields away from so much as a single sex scene - there is plenty of naughty dancing, steamy make-out sessions, and full frontal nudity to go around!

Elizabeth Shue and Ving Rhames play their roles seriously from start to finish and before you can ask yourself why; Jerry O'Connell has you snickering at his over the top portrayal of a sleazy, coke-head `show me your boobs' TV show host. Way over the top, he plays it; so the combination of him over-acting and Shue and Rhames playing it straight, was amusing.

The plot is extremely simple but fun. It's spring break and after an earthquake, below a popular lake - thousands of starving flesh-eating piranha have emerged from a hidden secondary lake that was long ago lost to the access of man. Some two million years ago; as is explained to us by Christopher Lloyd's character - some sort of fish guy.

The task of `lead character' is shared between Elizabeth Shue who plays the town Sheriff and her son Jake (Steven R. McQueen). Mom has to keep idiots safe at the lake, so it's up to Jake to babysit his little bro and sis. But the scumbag O'Connell character has offered Jake a job as a location scout for his video - and there's gonna be a ton of hot girls there, so what is he to do? He pays the kids his babysitting score plus an extra 20 to keep quiet, while he tends to more personated matters.

The movie is absolutely absurd in everything in tries, but never stops being enjoyable, even for a second. A girl's hair is stuck in a boat propeller - thus ripping her face off; a sharp razor-wire on the loose, slashes through two girls, hitting their bikini straps just right and removing their tops before they fall over, cut in half; and there's even a shot of Elizabeth Shue screaming, ""Get the f**k out of the water!"" when no one is listening to her. Oh, and did I mention that in the 3D version (which I recommend) you get to have a girl puke all over you in 3D?

As fun as all that sounds, I must warn you that if needless and continuous female nudity, and explicit shots of girls shaking what they've got, for prolonged periods of time does not interest you - then you may have a problem here. You know how when you watch Burn Notice there are little snippets of girls walking on the beach in bikinis, placed in between scenes throughout each episode? Yeah, think of that - only multiply the amount of women and the time spent with them by 10 and you'll be somewhere close to what's found nestled between all the carnage and mayhem of Piranha.

And while on the subject of carnage and mayhem; there's also an overabundance of that as well. May want to watch what you eat before attending. Piranha is right up there with the Hostel and Saw franchise as far as gore goes - and it's all out in the open on a hot sun-shinny day, versus a dark and gritty torture chamber. So you get to see every little detail, and it wasn't done with crappo-CGI.

I have yet to see the original which was released in 1978 but will be checking it out soon. It couldn't have been that bad, because it sparked the attention of James Cameron enough, to motivate him to write and direct the sequel: Piranha Part II: The Spawning, released in 1981!

The 2010 version is directed by Alexandre Aja, who has also given us such disgusting gifts as High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes (2006), and Mirrors. Anyone who casts Eli Roth in their movie as `Wet T Shirt Host'; is all right in my book! Aja did a terrific job with this film as he did his others, and not much could have been done to make it any better. It was a blast!

That being said; I know some of you will never see this film, and others of you will be mortified and mad at me for recommending it. But just relax - I've told you what it contains and this is a total guy's movie, yes. No one is saying it isn't! But that's why studios have Eat Pray Love in theaters at the same time. So if he drags you to this - drag him to that!

P.S.:
This is not to imply that all women and only women will find this film offensive."
955,3.0,"I had a hard time reviewing this one, because there are some good parts and some bad parts. Of course it is overly predictable and cheesy, like every other romantic comedy.  There were definitely some funny parts. Overall, it's entertaining and worth watching. The things I did not like were:
1. The way Stan acted when she told him she was pregnant was kind of silly. He accused her of lying, even though she didn't lie. They had only been on one date, and he's acting like they were some sort of serious couple.
2. At first I was happy that they were going to show a natural home birth (you don't see that very often in movies), but that was ruined by the fact that the whole thing was portrayed as some sort of hippie ceremony. Everyone was freaking out and basically overreacting to the situation, playing the drums, singing, and screaming. And of course, they had to put the part in there about the bowel movement, but they probably wouldn't have done that if it had been a typical hospital birth (anything for laughs I guess). The worst part of all was the reaction of Zoe and Stan. Zoe freaks out and acts completely immature and childish, as if seeing childbirth is some sort of scary disgusting thing. Stan acts like he is traumatized and comments that he ""never wants to see that ever again.""
Seriously? I saw 2 births by the time I was 16. Do the producers of this movie really think people are that immature?
3. After they broke up and Zoe goes to talk to him, Stan goes on and on about how she ""broke his heart."" Come on! They had only been broken up for a day or two, and he acted like he had been sitting at home sobbing for months.
4. They just *had* to incorporate Jennifer's Lopez's butt into the storyline.
5. There is a scene where her friend says something like ""you don't even want to know what pregnancy does to your bladder."" And then proceeds to laugh and say she ""just peed a little."" It seems like they were trying to incorporate ""pregnancy humor"" into the movie without getting too graphic, but anyone with any knowledge of it knows that this has nothing to do with the bladder. It is has to do with pressure on the pelvic floor muscles, and during and after pregnancy these muscles can be strengthened to prevent bladder leakage. Not extremely significant, but noticeable that they included wrong information in the movie.

I don't particularly like Jennifer Lopez so I didn't have high hopes for this movie. It is funny and entertaining if you are just looking for a movie to watch, but don't count on it being great."
956,2.0,"Seeing how two of the big three horror franchises from the eighties (Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street) where already remade (Halloween & Friday the 13th) it was only a matter of time until Hollywood took us down a new walk on Elm Street. All we could do as loyal fright fans is hope that they would get it right, they DIDN'T!

With everything about this movie being completely wrong I guess I should mention the only thing they got right, the tone. After many sequels of Freddy being more comedic, Hollywood knew they had to make him scary, again. I don't know if I'd necessary say he's scary in this movie, but at least he's serious and not portrayed as a clown like in Nightmare 6. But it's not enough to just get the tone right, you have to also make a GOOD movie!

THE MISTAKES:

The cast. The cast is pretty much good across the board all except for one actor, Katie Cassidy, and it's not her acting, it's the way the director portrayed her. Let's be honest here people, Katie Cassidy was about THIRTY dame years old when she did this movie, this being her third remake (When a Stranger Calls, Black Christmas, A Nightmare on Elm Street) I'm not knocking her for being thirty, I'm knocking the director and wardrobe designer. If you hire a thirty year old actress to play a sixteen year old High School student try to at least make her look sixteen. Everything from her wardrobe to her hair made her look her age. They even had her wearing a trench coat in one scene! What teenage girl wears a trench coat? With the right makeup and wardrobe it is possible to make a much older person look the age of the character, for example, Rachel McAdams was dame there thirty herself when she shot Mean Girls, but with the right makeup  and most importantly, the right wardrobe she completely looked the part of High School queen bee Regina George. You see, it can work when done right! In this case it was done completely wrong!

CGI. Just because you can use CGI doesn't mean you should use it! I personally believe that CGI has NO PLACE WHATSOEVER in horror movies! It should stay in action\adventure movies were it belongs! Not in my beloved horror genre! This film uses CGI way too much and sometimes in very unnecessary ways. I remember watching this movie in the theater, seeing Freddy come on screen thinking to myself ""Why does Freddy look like a freaking video game?"" Putting CGI on the man of the hour himself was imbaressing for every person who worked on this movie! When fans go to see an A Nightmare on Elm Street movie we go to see Freddy and the genius artist who do his makeup, not to see some X box, playstation crap!

Sets. The entire production looks like it was shot entirely on a Hollywood backlot. There are no more than few shots that look like they were actually shot on a real location.

Jackie Earl Haley isn't bad as the new Freddy, and if you do a remake you have to recast the role, but no matter how good he is in the role, there will never be another actor who can do the character better than Robert Englund. He's been Freddy for more than thirty years now and nobody knows the character better!

Don't waist your time watching this crap, just watch the original and it's many sequels (except for Nightmare 6, that one is worst than this.) There much better movies without a bunch of crap CGI! THIS MOVIE BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!

In my opinion the ""geniuses"" at platinum dunes should act like this movie never existed and do what the fans want and bring back Wes Craven and Robert Englund and do the long awaited prequel that Englund himself said he would be more than willing to do. It would make perfect sense now, because Robert Englund now is about the age that Wes Craven originally had in mind for the character."
957,2.0,"This movie has no idea whether its a buddy cop comedy, or a parody of one. At points its serious, and then it is the complete opposite the next minute, to the point of being rediculous. Will Ferell never ""goes there"" with his classic Anchorman rants, and Mark Wahlberg plays the most annoying character ever. It was just a mess of a movie, and I wanted to give it a low star rating, b/c I was sickened to see 4 stars, and so many positive reviews. Click the dislike button now, you freaking no-lifes. I'm not gonna respond to hostile comments either, so just to get this out of the way: SCREW YOU."
958,1.0,"This is an awful movie. It's essentially more of the same atrocity that fueled ""Are We There Yet?"" Cartoon characters, horribly brattish children, awful acting, weak writing, and an overall feel that this was something Nickelodeon or ABC Family wouldn't even consider. Honestly....Jackie Chan in geek glasses playing straight man to freaking Billy Ray Cyrus? Oh, Jackie...

As far as entertainment for a family, do you really want your children watching these horrible, rude, disrespectful, sarcastic, and downright perverted children? Why would anyone find these brats amusing? You know what would've been truly funny? If they found some Jackie Chan, Jr. to kick their horrid little a$$es. I'd buy the movie if that was the case. The faint glimmer of hope that if I watched it until the end, I'd actually see some long overdue comeuppance for these children was the only reason I hung around. Seriously, there have got to be at least five things laying within immediate reach of you right now that are less wasteful of your time than this movie. This movie is so terrible that you'd be better off staring at a blank tv screen for ninety minutes than burning up time watching The Spy Next Door. You've been forewarned."
959,1.0,"Let's do this in list format, since this film is sort of designed to be nothing more than what it claims to be.

The most serious problems of the film are:
- The so-called ""elite killers"" that go up against the Predators sure don't seem it, and that alone ruins the entire purpose for which most people saw this film, like me. They show little intelligence or experience, walk straight into traps, and neither talk nor think like someone used to killing for a living would do. They might as well have been nobodies given a gun, since they very rarely show any skill in what they're supposed to be able to do. Call me on it if I'm wrong, but are people such as these, who are said to be ruthless killing machines, usually not-so-eager to join up and become a ragtag group of buddies, really this nice and trusting among each other?
- Even though they realize what they are, where they are, and why they're there, not a single person questions the one person who claims to literally be the opposite of an elite killer: a freaking doctor who says he was on his way to work, who is totally unarmed the entire time, and is completely inept in combat. Seriously, not one of them thinks that's a little weird, even though they know the rest of them are acclimated to extreme violence and murder?
- Cool! Laurence Fishburne is an elite survivalist who's been doing this for ten of their hunting seasons and survived! Easily the most badass character in the group who actually knows what he's doing, unlike everyone else, you almost think he's going to save the movie from being as boring as it's been so far. Except...
- ...Fishburne instead gets maybe ten minutes total of screen time doing nothing but talking before being killed in a way that makes you wonder how he could have possibly lasted as long as he claims he did. Well, so much for Fishburne saving the movie as the only character who seems to have any idea what he's doing.
- Terribly generic musical score that lacks any suspense at all, so bad that it's worth noting. I'm not expecting an OST here, but come on. I don't think I'll ever understand why they chose an old happy dance song for the ending credits, which had nothing to do with anything that just happened. I was kind of expecting something a little more serious, not a cartoon, which is what it basically is.
- The death row inmate, apparently just a sexual predator (possibly an inside joke of sorts), who talks about doing cocaine and raping women for fun--well, you'd just kind of make the connection that he's probably a psychopath who is not nice to anyone. He probably wouldn't help out the team much, and if it were me, I'd have shot him first for clearly having no intentions of helping anyone out. Anyone who talks that crazy in front of everyone is not even a smart psychopath, so he's probably going to use any opportunity he can to let the Predators take everyone else, like a psychopath would tend to do before being killed himself. Instead, he ends up being...heroic? And genuinely nice from there on out? What? A serial rapist who probably killed at least one of his victims (it's never explicitly stated that he killed anyone, but he *was* on death row, so it's not exactly a stretch) ends up being heroic, the only one most likely to betray absolutely everyone at the drop of a hat?
- A laughably stereotypical Yakuza character who fakes not being able to speak English...dies in the most laughably stereotypical way imaginable.
- It just can't seem to take itself seriously. The majority of the film is our cast of people who seem to be picked at random and showing no skill at killing talking a whole lot.
- Everything about it is boring, from the characters to the environment to the Predators themselves. There just aren't any moments of real excitement.

Also, as a last note, the trailer is a lie. Scenes are in the trailer that are not in the movie. The obvious emphasis on Laurence Fishburne, who does pretty much absolutely nothing except say a few lines before being killed off (apparently this film had an even lower budget than I imagined), is nothing short of deception in the advertising of the film. Audiences generally don't appreciate that kind of thing, although it's common.

Definitely not recommended for absolutely anyone, even if you like the concept of it, Predator fan or not. Don't be drawn in by the great idea here; it doesn't actually occur in the film."
960,1.0,"I have not been compelled to write a review for a film in quite some time.  Let me summarize the target-demographic audience who would enjoy this...residents of the morgue, anybody who bought the farm, the comatose, and possibly those in dire need of money so they volunteer for experimental drug-testing with the government.  In short--the brain dead!!

First a couple things about myself, so you can determine whether or not you will identify with my tastes.

I'ma guy, I love guy movies (No Country For Old men, Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Jackie Chan movies, Transformers, last Hulk, Blade series, etc.).  I eagerly await films like the new Tron, Thor, etc.  I'MA GUY, I like good action with credible characters...

With that said!!

I really, REALLY, REALLY disagree with the cast of characters.  I feel like these actors are forced on you and there is little to no credibility for their ""hardcore"" edge.  Adrian Brody??  SERIOUSLY?!  This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's successor?!  Arnold was a classic hero in the original plot, he had credibility as a tough guy.  The guy from The Pianist however???  NOT SO MUCH!!  Casting Topher Grace, he was slightly out of place but he filled his role, the other losers in this film didn't add the slightest bit of credibility that they should have lended to their on-screen personas.  Everything about this film is so artificial.

The predators, which I am a huge fan of in the movie universe, have little on-screen time.  We're talkin' maybe 15-20 minutes of the film, which is pretty sad 'cause the film is 109 minutes running.  The predators seem to get weaker and weaker in the film industry.  When they debuted back in 1989 in the original film, AN ELITE SPECIAL FORCES TEAM had their hands FULL!!!  They nearly all bought the farm against ONE SINGLE PREDATOR!!

Then the sequel, a jelly-donut grazer was able to stop predator, AVP, a freaking scientist...seriously, just an ordinary female scientist!!  The predator, if you branch out into more than just the films, but in video games, comics, etc., is supposed to be one of the most formidable forces in the known universe.  These films do nothing to lend to that credibility or even honor the idea of the Predator race.  This film follows suit and makes the Predators appear weaker than ever!  The casting is horrible, the plot cheesier, I liked the second AVP more than this and that's a statement 'cause that plotline was crap!

You would expect a lot of special effects and wow did they blow it here too, one of the staples of the Predator arsenal--the shoulder-mounted laser cannon--hahahaha, they shot one of the characters with no body armor and there was barely a first-degree burn, I seriously think the Predator could have just cloaked, walked up to the guy and gave him an ""Indian"" rug burn with more consequence than his laser cannon.  The production team for this film really did a grave injustice to everything that characterizes what a Predator should be.  The cloaking special effects are cheesier, the ""team"" against the predators have a very, VERY weak arsenal.  We're talking about MP-5ks, pistols, an automatic shotgun, and one mini-gun.  The premise of how the film introduces the characters as well???  Laughable...they try to dress it up in mystery but it's just cheesy.

Please save your money or rent.

I'm having a hard time trying to be unbiased but that's just how bad this film is.  I have a lot of tolerance for the original AVP 'cause at least it was cool and had some worthy action scenes, albeit a lame culmination for the plot.  But this is worse than the last AVP, in my opinion.  So you do the mathematics, if you've seen it...ask yourself if you want to waste your time.

Whoever is endorsing this really has no taste in quality, and while that's subjective, I strongly urge you to consider the merits of being a 40-year old soccer mom and knowing anything about warfare.  The plot had some neat ideas but was poorly executed.  Please avoid purchase at all costs!!"
961,5.0,"The LA Times reported that ""Dragon"" was a disaster after 3 years of production. Dreamworks called in story smiths Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois of ""Lilo and Stitch"" fame to repair it in two more. Sanders and Deblois have a knack for mixing Cute and Vicious, and what better film than one that tells the story of domesticating a wild dragon?

The results are fantastic; the buzz was that animators actually working on the film were in tears seeing their finished scenes cut together. I don't know if that story is true, but the dramatic tension in ""Dragon"" is worthy of an 86-minute film, the cinematography of Roger Deakins (normally a live-action guy) is some of the best I've seen in an animated film, and definitely this year.

I know this statement won't make me popular: the 3-D is overrated, and at times inhibits the film experience. My wife got headaches viewing it at times, and I never fully bought the experience as I had a big freaking pair of glasses on the whole time."
962,1.0,"Let me just say I recently purchased this film thinking it would be funny and fun to watch. I thought that at worst this film would be decent to watch! Boy was I wrong! Where do I even begin on this movie??? All I can say is I knew I had to post this review because I honestly don't want anyone else making the mistake of wasting their hard earned money on this ""freak"" of a movie.
Anyone who might actually enjoy the movie (and haven't read the book) this whole review does have some spoilers in it (if you could actually spoil this movie any worse than what it already is).

Where to begin.... well....
Firstly, this movie had zero plot, I mean if you call that a plot, seriously people all he pretty much does is walk around with ole shake-n-bake and talk about how he isn't going to drink blood or some other vampire stuff. Then it switches over to his friend (has he ever had acting lessons?? I think not) who is bent on being ""evil"" suddenly! I mean does anyone really buy this whole crap as they are watching this movie???

Secondly as I breifly mentioned in the previous statement, the acting was completely horrible, I felt like I was watching my local school play on video or something. Although the two main boys were bad, the family had to be the worse! I realize they were a small part, but I mean gosh! I could have got out there and made a more convincing parent!!!! I mean none of the actors were even convincing in his/her emitions or otherwise.

Thirdly, this story was not believeible, and yes I know this sounds stupid because it's a vampire movie but it's true. THe way the actors react to horrible situations in this movie, the way the story plays out is so stupid! I mean I hope the book series was completely off from this movie, cuz I would hate to think a story this crazy got published. I understand this is a a vampire story, but still. I mean, firstly, if some guy told me that I had to become a vampire in order to save my friend (when all was needed was the antidote) I'd be like ""what the heck? Are you a freaking nut chase or something? Vampires? If I even believed in vampires, how is me turning into one going to help my friend??"" I mean his whole reaction was not believeible.... Instead he was like I'll do it, as long as you help my friend. I mean really????? Plus, I mean his handler or what ever shake-n-bake is, said you have to fake your death and leave your family forever. and the boy (darren) is like Okay, I guess I have to leave them forever, and he doesn't even shed a tear or put up a real fuss! I mean hello!! If somebody told me I had to do all that I'd be breaking down and have a panic attack!!! I guess ole Darren must really hate his family and friends or some crap... or perhaps, this whole movie just really really SUCKS!!! Then the whole part of how his best friends suddenly hates his guts for no apparent reason. I mean really people??? What the heck is up with this movie?????

Fourthly, don't even get me started on how this movie acted like there was going to be some big important battle at the end!!!! This whole movie lead up like it was Darren's destiny to be the good guy on the non-killin side and the steve boy was suppose to be the ""evil"" one for the killing bloodsucking side and they were going to have an all out battle in the end and somehow the vampire world be changed or something. Instead you get all the way to the end and the two main characters pretty much fight like two year olds and then get broken up by this werido dude (that no one knows who the heck he is or why the heck he's doing any of the crap he's doing, whom I might add randomly shows up for no apparent reason.) Then this werid guy turns his dead vampire dude into some shrunken werid creature. Then Darren goes back to the freak camp and lays down in the coffin... the end!!! I mean seriously people!!! WHAT THE HECKKK??? I mean I was expecting something you know that would actually have an effect on it all, instead you are left knowing less after the movie then before you started watching it. I actually thought after the fight scene that there was a good thirty minutes left and we'd be seeing the real show down. This movie was like stopping in mid sentence and then the rest was just left out there hanging somewhere.

Fifthly, this movie had way tooo much added stupididy!!!!! I mean really if the bad plot, bad acting, and all the other dissappointments weren't enough to make this one of the suckest movies of all time we had to add all this completely unnessary stupididty!!!! For example, we have this werid woman who's limps regrow if chopped or bitten off, kinda like a skink and its tail regrows. Okay, that's fine, but why do we have to watch some werid sexual scene where she rips her finger off then french kisses with the finger in her lover's mouth. I mean ""EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"" doesn't even cover it. Not to mention the whole crap and extremely fake looking rotten muck thats in the wolfman's cage, and uhhh the werid guck that the shruken people have in their feed tub!!! I'd really like to know the shrunken peoples' purpose, besides bitting at people's hands? I mean really what do these people or the man that calls them his pets really have to do with the movie??? I mean the big guy that rides around in that car makes no sense!!!! I mean you talk about stupid. this guy just shows up outta no where and isn't a vampire, so what business does he have in their business, and talks about destiny all the time and then calls those shrunken people his pets. Which if they are then why the heck are they keeping them at the freak camp??? Because that means they would be knowingly keeping enemies that hear and see everything they do and would be telling their boss/owner??? WOWWWW this movie is so stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just can't believe it!!!

Need anymore reasons??? I mean really people do you need any more REASONS!!! I just want to scream thinking about how stupid and awlful this movie was. It most defintley makes the tops in the worse movie of all time!!!!"
963,5.0,"As a huge Alice in Wonderland fan, I have always enjoyed the different ways this story was told and always felt a little lost at the end...I'm a big ""What happens next"" girl. I love it when my characters get their HEA or Happily Ever After.

Simply put, this story really gave me the ""What next"" that I have been craving. I never saw it on TV but after seeing the new Alice in Wonderland with Depp, et al, and being mildly amused by it (It was a good dark story and really gave you a grasp of what could be), my daughter said that I NEEDED to see this version. So I ordered the disk. (I figured if I didn't like it, I'd give it to her, because she LOVES this version.)

I was intrigued, from the start. I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't a retelling of the original Alice story but a continuation (much like the Depp version).  The story has enough dark to it to be believable and enough humor in it to keep your attention...(Hatter's line in the beginning about girls in wet dresses showed me that I needed to keep on my toes and listen.) With a cast that includes Bates and Curry, I knew I had to give it a shot. And, sigh...I wasn't disappointed even if I thought that Tim Curry should have had more screen time. Yes, Andrew Lee Potts is adorable, stealing your heart from minute one, and just gifted in this role - I looked forward to every scene he was in and Matt Frewer as the White Knight, Charlie, was freaking amazing and he just nailed it. Both of them were sane enough to be beloved and insane enough to be believable.

And Alice, Caterina Scorsone, just rocks. I can't stand a ""woe is me"" heroine, and Scorsone, goes in and kicks butt. She has her moments where she is just there but her character is learning and growing and really gets tested...but when the moment comes, she lets loose and just plain rocks. She's smart and strong, but soft and caring, very well-rounded character for the type of story this was.

While there are a few things that were superfluous....like the Drink Me Bottle (with its warning label - lol) and the Cheshire cat scene...I don't think it detracted from the story nor did I really miss them.  This is an entirely different tale with same but different characters. However, all the more enjoyable. Just as Tin Man was to the Wizard of Oz, this is to Wonderland. I do believe Mr. Carroll would be impressed.

So, no, my daughter can get her own copy, this one's mine. Goes on my movie shelf with the others that are my ""need a good story"" tales. I love a good HEA and it's about bloody time Hatter got his."
964,1.0,"I am a huge animal lover, but this movie was so freaking slow and pointless that I stopped watching part way through to check some of the 1-star reviews to decide whether to bother finishing it. Turns out the movie is nothing more than a one-dimensional (and extremely fictionalized) dramatization of a 30-second true anecdote, dragged out excruciatingly in order to make it long enough to sell as a movie. Here comes a spoiler, but if I were you I would read it anyway and save yourself an hour & a half out of your life: a guy adopts a dog that he found; the dog waits every evening at the train station for the guy to get home from work; one day the guy dies, but the dog continues to wait for him for years, living out in the elements the entire time. The end. If you are a parent of small children, run screaming from this film because even though it is rated G, it features extended, traumatic scenes of a dog being neglected and suffering. BTW If I were a parent, I would also not want my kids to watch a movie that glorifies and renders ""heartwarming"" the incredibly cruel and irresponsible behavior of most of the adults in it."
965,5.0,"Great freaking movie action packed with breathtaking scenes. This is one of those movies that belongs in your collection if you like the supernatural good vs. evil, heaven vs. hell type of movies.
Here I am 2 years later looking for the 3D version since I didn't see it in 3D originally. I'm wondering if there is any difference as many studios only release a theatrical version of the 3D to save on productions costs."
966,1.0,"This is the WORST movie I have ever seen. I mean come on, a post-apocolypic, religious, cowboy, action, vampire movie?? Are you freaking kidding me? How stupid. My IQ dropped within the first 10 minutes of this dvd. Terrible acting, and terrible everything else. Rediculous and a waste of time. I wouldn't watch this movie again if I was paid to."
967,2.0,"This show has one interesting character. The rest are freaking boring, which is a shame because the premise is pretty cool. Why cast such uninteresting actors? And why are the characters so poorly written? The plot line is quality work, but for what is basically supposed to be a police procedural the ""cops"" spend half of every episode complaining, and the other half fighting and sulking. The  lead cop brings her ex onto the team, who sits through most of the pilot. (Sulking.) Then in a later episode they have a fight about her keeping things from him and for the rest of that episode he sulks and ignores her calls.(The calls of the lead investigator during a case involving the possible murder of a woman.) Because he is her ex she does not have him removed from the team, but tries to make up. So very irritating. I keep wanting to shout at the characters to grow the f up."
968,3.0,"Maybe it's my definition of comedy or dark comedy, but I generally think you should laugh or find something humorous somewhat regularly throughout a movie for it to called a comedy - but that's just me. So no belly laughs or 'OMG that's so freaking funny"" to be found here even for a dark comedy. Defendor has a couple of chuckle moments but nothing close to what it really takes to call a comedic. Some of the ""superhero weapons"" stuff are a little humorous once but just once then you've seen it, next please.

Anyway, the general premise of the movie about a guy who is a bit of a simpleton and believes he is a superhero out to avenge a past wrong by Captain Industry and stop those that commits crimes on his behalf. Defendor is a strange blender mix of a little bit of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blankman/dp/B00005T30A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blankman</a>, a cup of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Batman/dp/B000B5XOY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Batman</a>&nbsp;and just a pinch of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-am-Sam/dp/B000066HAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I am Sam</a>&nbsp;that is overall a good idea just poorly marketed under the wrong general genera. Now to be fair it's not a bad movie and you find yourself just as the people in the movie rooting for Defendor to save the day and correct what is wrong in the city by night because by day he is a mild mannered road work. All in all Defendor (the character) is misguided from a troubled past but has a good heart and a great friend (Paul) that only wants to help him, a girl (Kat) whom is a crackhead hooker that he only wants to help, Dr. (Ellen) that really wants to believe in him, cops that barely tolerate him and various criminals that want to kill him. But what will happen to him?

As I said it's a decent film, it's not a great film and I will not be adding to my collection anytime soon. Rent it if you want to, but you really won't be missing a lot if you don't nor will you be demanding your hour and half back if you do. Woody Harrelson turns in a good but increasingly typical not-quite-all-there-character in need of anger management performance so nothing new from him. It has a fairly decent script, and the acting across the board is good but the story just needed a little polish in my opinion but for a first effort by director Peter Stebbings it's better than most first efforts I've seen. I'm only giving it 3.5 stars as I'm taking one away for the misleading dark comedy tag and marketing and another half star for the rather choppy story line at times. The DVD has a few extras on it, deleted scenes, outtakes, featurette in which they admit it's more of a dark drama than a dark comedy and commentary which I haven't seen yet.

So in the end... meh it's OK. It's not an 'avoid it' nor is it a 'don't miss' watch it if you want too."
969,5.0,"THE LAST STATION

STARRING: Helen Mirren, James McAvoy, Christopher Plummer, Kerry Condon, Paul Giamatti, Anne-Marie Duff, John Sessions and Patrick Kennedy

WRITTEN BY: Michael Hoffman; based on the novel by Jay Parini

DIRECTED BY: Michael Hoffman

Rated: R
Genre: Drama
Release Date: 04 December 2009

I love and adore Sandra Bullock and am happy for her that she received an Oscar. But if you ask me, it belonged to Helen Mirren for her performance in The Last Station. I was blown away. She was so natural, so sensational, and so terrific; as was the film as a whole, but we'll get to that shortly.

Mirren plays Sofya Tolstoy; the wife of legendary Russian author Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer). At times they seem like the perfect couple, but soon we realize that their long lasting relationship is plagued with problems and mistrust.

Leo has gained such notoriety for his fame in writing, that his wife fears others will take advantage of him for his wealth, and that if he should pass, she will be left with nothing. This fear is birthed primarily by a snooty little man by the name of Vladimir, played nicely by Paul Giamatti. Vladimir wants Leo to sign something that would handover creative control to some of his most astounding works.

James McAvoy also gives a radiant performance as Valentin; a promising young man plagued by his youthful insecurities so much that he has found himself to be a man, and yet still a virgin. He is hired on to assist Leo, and the two generate a rather wholesome friendship; Valenitn no doubt reminding Leo of himself as a youngster.

Valentin's friendship with Leo grows and thus causes him to be concerned for not only the old poet's health, but for what is to happen to his name, his wealth, his work, and his estate, should he leave this earth.

I loved to romance that thrived between Leo and Sofya; it was believable and filled with gloriously fun moments that were shadowed perfectly with ugly, dark ones. These actors are two truly gifted spirits indeed, and they did this film a supreme justice.

In addition to the Tolstoy romance, there is a younger one as well. A beautiful worker on Leo's estate named Sasha (Kerry Condon) is keen to Valentin's unique awkwardness and blinding charm. She smells it as easily as blood in the water to a shark; virgin! She's older, more experienced, and all the wiser, and she feeds on his innocence. Both deliver great perfect performances and they share a very intimate moment that was one of the steamiest of 2009.

The film is based on the real life of Leo Tolstoy, but it often feels like a play. Nearly the entire thing takes place in one central location (you can relax, it's very large and elegant; not the least bit boring) and these characters go through such small scales of playwright drama; but it's the way they handle them that turns them into massive cinematic treasures, and its divinely entertaining.

Somehow, I haven't the slightest clue how, but somehow, this film did not find itself nominated for best picture at the Oscars, which is astounding; especially considering there were a whopping 10 freaking nominees! It surely should have been nominated - at the very least, and I can think of more than one film that was nominated, the spot of which this gem could have rightfully plucked for itself."
970,5.0,"I won't go into too much detail, because part of the fun of this anime series is just hanging on for the ride, not knowing alot going into it.

But basically the story is about a girl who enters a very nice, prestigious high school where rich kids are numerous and poor people are thought of as fairytale material. She meets the highschool's Host Club, which is basically a group of young men who entertain the school's young ladies. Keep in mind they're all rich, and somewhat arrogant, so they kind of just sit around and talk about rich kid stuff.

The Host Club thinks she's a guy, she accidently breaks an expensive vase and instantly earns herself a very large debt, and the only way to pay it off is to join the Host Club.

This is just the beginning. Like I said I don't want to go into too much detail because Ouran High School Host Club is the type of anime that is best enjoyed when not too much is known about it going in.

I was mainly interested in the series because I thought they were all guys (she looks like a guy when she works as a ""Host Boy"") and I thought it would be fun and romantic (and gay) to watch.

It is fun, and romantic too. But Its not what I expected. However, I never thought it would be THIS good! I am really enjoying the series (almost finished with it) and I like how each episode brings enough humor and character movement to keep you interested. And speaking of the humor, I find myself laughing out-loud alot. This type of comedy is just the thing I have been looking for. And there's just enough gay humor too!

The animation is really cool. Very detailed, and cartoonish (if only to add to the comedic effect). The music is nice, but nothing worth freaking out over.

But if there's one thing that makes this series shine, its the characters/story. Its charming, witty, hilarious, with hints of mild sexual comedy and social stuff (rich people, poor people), but it never takes itself too seriously. The show knows what it is and what it wants, and as a result we the viewers are presented with a well thought out anime series with high replay value.

I'm really glad I got into this series because its now one of my favorites. Its easy to fall in love with the Host Club boys, and they're all compelling and quirky enough that they move the episodic situations along with ease and before you know it you've been watching for hours.

When an anime series accomplishes this, its well worth your time in my opinion."
971,4.0,"I love old school slasher movies and that's why I wanted to rent this at the red box. I finally saw it and was afraid it was gonna be a boring, cheesy wanna-be scary movie, but it creeps up on you. I didn't expect what finally went down. I can't say too much without giving it away but let's just say, all is not what it seems! Angie takes a babysitting job out in the middle of freaking nowhere and it ends up being one hell of a night for her. Her bravery surprised me considering she obviously comes from a super catholic mother. I'd recommend checking this one out if you're a fan of the genre and are tired of the cliched low-budget horror movies you've been seeing lately!"
972,5.0,"i love this film, i remember when it first came out in 2010. i never saw it in theaters and i don't recall ever seeing a trailer for the movie, but then when it first came out to dvd i kept seeing it in borders and the cover kept hypnotizing me with the bright green cover so i had to contemplate on whether or not to buy and see if it was good. few months after i still kept seeing the dvd and so finally i bought it on dvd and boy was i amazed! i never really cared for romantic comedies till i actually watched a few in 2009. i still believe that most of them are really bad but there are a few good ones out there like this one. amy adams and matthew goode are an amazing pair. i love matthew's accent in this film (even if you don't know what everything he says sometimes when he murmurs or it's an unfamiliar term with us americans.) and they were smart to make it in ireland i have a long history with the uk and ireland and they couldn't of filmed in a better location. seriously i am obsessed with those islands! watch it. it's funny and romantic and i find that this happens to be my favorite romantic comedy out there, especially in bluray finally started transferring my purchases to bluray the quality is freaking ridiculous (didn't earlier because of the height difference from the dvds and bluray's, i am a little bit OCD when it comes to things like that) buy it it's fantastic!"
973,5.0,"The one-star-giving reviewer, Melody, is not wrong that there is not much action in ""Autumn,"" and if your main reason for wanting the DVD is because you're a David Carradine fan, don't bother--he has a tiny, pointless cameo.

BUT.  If you're a fan of whip-smart zombie movies (although the word is never used, come on, they're freaking zombies already, not ""meatcoats""), like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pontypool/dp/B002TZS5G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pontypool</a>, and you have more patience for nuance and sophistication than our young reviewer friend did, then ""Autumn"" is extremely rewarding.

It's light on the scares and heavy on horror...the emotional, psychological horror of death and of the dead.  The way the dead start off inanimate, immobilized (as the dead should be) and gradually, gradually gain the characteristics of the zombies we know from the Romero oeuvre and his imitators is the masterstroke of the film, allowing tension to ratchet up slowly.  And for a low budget film, ""Autumn"" boasts some exquisite camera work that only fleetingly becomes so creative as to be annoying.

Now don't misunderstand: ""Autumn"" is not ""Citizen Cane.""  It is a ZOMBIE movie, at its heart.  But even though it has many of the elements familiar to the genre, the approach is fresh, and the emphasis on psychology rather than mere viscera elevates ""Autumn"" well beyond what the genre usually produces.  I'd go so far as to recommend ""Autumn"" to someone who I don't think would typically enjoy zombie movies, and I would only say that of perhaps three other such movies (aforementioned two, plus&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/B0006A9FKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>).

If you demand zombie hordes ripping out the entrails of entire populations, not for you ""Autumn.""  But if you can appreciate apocalypse on an intimate level, similar in some ways to ""The Road,"" then the existential dread within ""Autumn"" might be just your thing."
974,5.0,"Sion Sono is currently my favorite film-maker right now.. His movies are freaking brilliant/thought-provoking and flat out entertaining... If you're looking to dive into Japanese Cinema, look no further or stop looking and start diving into this guy's filmography.... I just hope for the U.S distribution nothing will be edited or cut out, we the people demand the fully uncut version and rumor is floating around that this movie was supposedly 6 hrs???"
975,5.0,"People who give this 1 star, don't seem to understand that a movie such as The Book of Eli is a form of entertainment, which an ensamble of great actors come together and deliver. People become so serious to point out its flaws that their judgement is bias, and one sided. First off. Remember this is a FICTIONAL movie and it carries a twist of religion (that the one star reviews seem to gripe about), the good and the bad, exposistion, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement. Its story covers the basics. Although many people feel queezy about religion like its some sort of big evil repulsive creature, remember to watch this movie with an open mind, and not like one of a 8 year old. This movie is entended to entertain, and it does that. If you have a big freaking problem with religion in general, then skip this movie and quit whining. Otherwise, if you give it a chance, you might actually like this movie.

Although it has this ""religious"" element, The Book of Eli tries to not keep your mind focused on just that fact. It brings together the gritty action, western kind of feel as Denzel is so on point to maintain, that sometimes you forget about the whole religion theme, the bible, and all that stuff people seem to have such a problem with. I do wish there was a little more scenes with Denzel laying the smackdown on a few people. He has a mission that he is determined to carryout before he dies and nobody is going to stop him from reaching it. Not only does it have the action and the violence that mostly everyone enjoys, but you end up kind of getting drawn to Denzels character and feel drawn into to not just him, but gary oldman playing a fine villain who is determined to seize what denzel has and use it for his own greed and his own agenda. Also, it delivers the twist at the end that if you haven't figured out the spoiler from the million other reviews, just makes you go ""wow."" It may not be the greatest movie ever made, but for what its worth, it is a good flick and is worth picking up or at least renting. But like I have said, if you USE AN OPEN MIND to watch this movie you might enjoy it a little more, just a thought."
976,3.0,"This was right here one of the worst ppv's so far in 2010, this had only some good matches and was just terrible at some points.

Intercontinental championship
Drew McIntyre vs. Kofi Kingston
Really, i wasn't very happy about the turn out to this opener. The story line was that McIntyre would get fired and that he would face the winne of kofi/christian, but this was just a little boring, but had its moments. But Kofi finally picked up the win to become the new intercontenental champ. 3.5/5

R-Truth vs. Ted Dibiase
This was also another just filler in the event. The match never had any moments at all and was just down right boring. But was a nice win for Truth, following the next night with him gaining the US title. 2/5

S.E.S Pledge vs. Hair match
Rey Mysterio vs. CM Punk
Wow, this ppv finally had a good match after two fillers. But, this match was great for all of its 13 minuets. This had highflying, brutal action. These two put everything on the line here, and the outcome came as Mysterio shaving CM Punk bald, which made him put on a rediculous mask. But, this match was only one of three good matches that night, and deserves some nice praise. 4.5/5

Unified Tag Team championship
The Hart Dynasty vs. Jerimiz
This was actually a better match than i thought it would turn out to be. These two teams put on a good and at points exciting match for the tag titles. But at the end, the miz getting dominated and given the hart attack to, was the best part in the match, and for The Hart Dynasty to pull off another great win. 4/5

Randy Orton vs. Edge
Well, i really don't have anything good to say about this match. This match could have been better, only if it was longer. This match was only eleven minuets because Orton became injured in this match with a dislocated shoulder so the wwe just decided to make it a freaking double count-out. So, really this match never lived up to it's expectations and wasn't good at all. 3/5

World Heavyweight championship
Jack Swagger vs. Big Show
I knew how this match would turn out as, the big word known as disqualification. This was just five minuets and was just terrible. Swagger was just dominate at first until Show got fired up, but if that wasn't enough to ruin a match, swagger had to go and get a chair to beat show, but this match is only getting a rating only for the beat down after the match on swagger. 3/5

Divas championship
Eve vs. Maryse
This right here shows you that the WWE was just making fun of Swagger and Show, and put the Divas title match before the main event. This wasn't really even a match at all, just a freakin filler, the only good part about it was when everybody saw Maryse. 1/5

I Quit match for the WWE championship
John Cena vs. Batista
This was definatly the best match of the ppv. These two beat the living hell out of each other until someone said i quit. Well, batista was the sucker who said it, only to say it the next night on RAW, but say it to quit his job(good ridance). But this match, like the last amn standing match the month before, was very brutal. This went everywhere, and had moments like Batista slamming cena through the announce table,  trying to run over cena and running a car into the lights, another was the attitude adjusment on the hood on the car, and the famous i quit from Batista, and a attitude adjustment right through the stage, following a bicycle kick from Sheamus moments after. 4/5

Well, this ppv really dissapointed me, and was a waste of a event, there wasn't even a five star match, but had some good matches. I don't really recommend to pick this up when it comes out."
977,5.0,"I enjoyed the film so freaking much. The first part of it was a bit weird, unusual, but when it got to the second part I understood how much I enjoy the movie. I didn't want to go anywhere else just to sit and wtch. In my opinion it is a different kind of a movie and the actors are great. I have no complains about nothing. It's a brilliant film. If you want to know it better then watch it yourself. i gave my opinion and I definitely don't care about haters of the movie. And I totally understand a guy who would give it a thouand stars. Im on his side. I just wonder whether there will be or possibly no second riverworld. I honestly think there will be no riverworld 2. But I so loved it. It's an amazing movie."

This program has stirred something in me. In the past nine months I have discovered guys I had never even heard of before in other wonderful old series such as Rod Cameron,Clu Gullager,John Russell,What Im trying to say is that I have discovered that there is a treasure chest full of DVD releases of fantastic series from the fifties such as Highway patrol,tall man, Soldiers of fortune, Wagon train,Coronado 9 and lots more which blows the pants off what I was watching a year ago, and Top of the rock is Highway patrol. Broderick Crawford is so freaking cool as he hollers commands into his walkie talkie. The guy has an awesome screen presence and is the John Wayne of the highway. I wasn't even born when these fine shows were being created and I encourage others to try them out. Had I not gambled with this box set I would never have discovered that tv today is so so poor in comparison to what went before. God bless you Broderick wherever you are.

981,4.0,"Being the first full-length Batman animated movie in a long time that had one consistant story to it(Gotham Knight not withstanding), the latest movie, Under The Red Hood is a retelling of the Under The Hood story arc from the Batman comics. This is a bold new direction for DC Universe by taking a character they've tried selling as being more family-oriented in productions like Batman: Brave And The Bold, and bringing the one that most die-hard comic readers can identify with on the level of The Dark Knight.

The story begins in the past with Joker under the payroll of Ra's Al Ghul keeping Batman and Robin #2(Jason Todd)busy while he tries yet again to take over the world. However, the Joker ""shockingly"" goes way overboard, and kills Robin. Fast forward to five years later where a new masked man called the Red Hood is shaking up things in Gotham City by slowly taking over territory of local crime lord, Black Mask. Batman busts up a delivery of an Amazo robot with the help of Nightwing, but the goons smuggling it are taken out by the Red Hood. Originally, the Red Hood was the alias that the Joker used before he was given his permanent skin bleach. Bats and Nightwing check with Joker in locked in Arkham to see if he's got any connection to this new Red Hood, but even your novice Bat-Fan could tell you the real Joker would've let you know if it was him. The Dynamic-former-Duo track down Hoodie robbing some pushers, but Nightwing hoits his widdle toe, and spends the rest of the movie on the bench. Black Mask sends out the Fearsome Hand Of Four after Red Mask, who are a team of cyber-ninjas original to the movie, but Batman shows up and they fold that deck together. Batman then deduces that R.H. is really Jason Todd, and takes the Batwing over to the other side of the world to have a chat with Ra's Al Ghul. Ra's revealed that he tried making amends for causing Jason to die by dipping him in his time-honored plot device, the Lazarus Pit. Jason came back, but pissed off as Hell, and escaped from Ra's. After hearing this, Batman zooms back to Gotham, to find that Black Mask sprung Joker out of Arkham to kill Red Hood, but Joker doublecrossed him(suprise!), and uses him as bait to lure out his current successor. Red Hood makes off with Joker, and gets Batman to meet him in Crime Alley. Red Hood unmasks to show is indeed Jason Todd. Jason then corners Batman into either choosing between shooting him or Joker, which he stops Jason, and the building they're in blows up. Batman and Joker survive, but Jason's fate remains unknown. The movie ends with Batman reflecting on when Jason first became Robin.

First, I'd like to say how this movie differs from the comics. In the original context, Jason Todd was brought back to life mainly because the evil Superboy-Prime ""punched reality"", and made it so Jason came back to life, although recent retellings of Red Hood's origin also include him backstoking in a Lazarus Pit. There's ben alot of retconning involving Jason's resurrection, but the movie managed to pull it all together well. A few other things like the Black Mask hiring some C-List supervillains from the Secret Society instead of the ""Hand Of Four"" from the original story, although it makes more sense for them to have Batman taking on Mortal Kombat wannabes instead of Captain Nazi, even though they could've had them be the Royal Flush Gang or some other recognizable DC villains. There was also the rewrite of the Death In The Family story where Joker blows up Robin in the middle east, instead of Europe. Plus, no supervillain would ever be stupid or desperate enough to hire the Joker to do anything, and certainly not a criminal mastermind like Ra's Al Ghul! Nightwing was also a little to flippant in this, like freaking out over the Amazo shooting lasers at him, which he should be used to after being with the Titans. Another character who was out of place was Black Mask, who is usually alot more cool and calculating, where here he was way more hotheaded.

As for the movie itself, I think this one has the best animation out of any of the other DC Universe movies, including some of the shorts from Gotham Knight. The city backgrounds look like it might be taking place in the actual downtown New York instead of fictional Gotham City, despite the fact that there are still police blimps in it. The character designs are awesome too, and Joker really looks menacing for once. Speaking of Mr. J, John DiMaggio(aka: ""Bender"")does a bang-up job as Joker by bringing in influences of both Mark Hamill and Heath Ledger. Bruce Greenwood is fair as Bats, but he's no Kevin Conroy. Jason Ackles is good as Jason Todd, and Neil Patrick Harris makes for a decent Nightwing. My only real low grade on the movie is that it should've ended on a more realistic note instead of just some happy flashback with young Jason Todd. The special edition DVD and Blu-Ray versions also feature a killer DC Showcase animated short of Jonah Hex starring Thomas Jane which is waaaay better than that crappy live-action movie, plus a decent documentary on Dick Grayson as Robin. So, in closing, I'd wholeheartedly demand that any Bat-Fan should store this in their cave between the giant penny and robot dinosaur!"
982,1.0,"Nothing past the first 10 minutes of this movie should have happened. I'll sum it up quickly so you can get on with your life.

A bunch of people are in a house. They are locked in and the same deadly nerve agent that was used in the Japanese subways is poisoning them. The doors are elaborate and cannot be used as an exit. But the windows are WEAKLY boarded up. They have plenty of tools to either go through the windows, or if those are barred, to punch through the wall. It doesn't take superhuman strength to break through plaster and bricks. It just takes a brain. They had 2 hours to punch through the wall and get to a hospital.

Do that and the movie ends.

And that is just an example of what all ""victims"" suffer in this series. They follow the rules given by this merely condescending and quite stupid villain. The victims NEVER think outside the box. They never search for traps. A trap might find them though. They know it's a trap, but they do the obvious thing anyway, knowing that it will kill them. How stupid do Bousman and Whannell think we are??? The victims NEVER think. For ONCE I would like someone to anticipate the tripwire and freaking STEP OVER IT!!!!!!!! AND STILL GET KILLED!!!! A good horror/suspense movie doesn't demand that they escape. It just demands intelligently thought out writing."
983,5.0,"I worked my way backwards from the US version of this series to the original BBC version here, and wasn't disappointed - in fact I laughed even harder and cringed in greater horror at the horrible antics of vampire Mitchell (smoldering-hot and yet lovably goofy Aidan Turner), the tea-making, conflicted ghost Annie and gentle werewolf George. Aidan Turner as Mitchell is by turns smokier and much funnier than the American actor who plays this character; he's a bit goofy but can glower and go fanged with the very Oldest and Worst. If you've seen Tovey in The History Boys, then you already know the man is freaking hilarious. It was delightful to see him do 'George' and render the character even more unforgettable, frequent-nakedness, screaming and all. Warning: the BBC version is grittier and gorier in my opinion, with the more graphic sex, some nudity, and profanity that BBC television doesn't even blink an eye at; not appropriate for children. Yet, I loved it."
984,5.0,"I bought the CD ""In Session"" about 10 years ago for my dad, as we are both SRV and A. King fans. He has not stopped talking about that disc ever since. He has cried just talking about how good it is. The way SRV essentially holds back for the majority of the disc in total respect for his mentor. And the respect that is given back to SRV from the blues juggernaut. So now, after 10 years, I stumbled across the DVD version and it is going to be one of dad's Christmas presents this year. He is going to freaking melt just seeing the box. We had no idea it existed. Will report back after Christmas."
985,4.0,"SIMPSONS fans can never agree just when the show lost its original magic. Some maintain it was around season ten or eleven, while some grumpers point to as early as season nine. I myself have not been unable to determine the exact moment of shark-jumping, but I can say with some authority it ain't Season 13. While by no means one of the best seasons and containing a fair share of clunkers, it still delivers enough classic satire and laugh-out-loud stupidity to be worth the asking price.

My favorite episodes:

""The Parent Rap"" - The villainous Judge Harm orders Homer and Bart to be shackled to each other as a punishment for Homer's bad parenting. The slap-fight between Homer and Bart is one of the funniest things I've seen on this show in years.

""Homer the Moe"" - Going back to his roots, Moe returns to bartending school, but when he stylizes Moe's Tavern into the Eurotrashy ""M,"" Homer, Lenny and Karl revolt and start their own bar...in Homer's garage. Homer forcing Lisa to cut lemons at 3 AM on a school night was classic Homer parenting.

""A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love"" - Spurred by a fortune cookie written by Homer, Mr. Burns falls for the ex-girlfriend of Springfield's resident felon, Snake.

""She of Little Faith"" - Any episode where Homer manages to burn down a church has got to be worth watching, and the guest appearance by Richard Gere as Lisa's Buddhist teacher is funnier than I expected (""You're lucky I've found enlightenment,"" he snaps at Lenny. ""Or I'd be kicking your ---!"")

""Jaws Wired Shut"" - Whenever Homer returns to college, wackiness ensues. In this case a broken jaw leads him to become a better father and a more attentive husband, the problem being that everyone prefers the old, moronic, lazy, selfish Homer.

""The Lastest Gun in the West"" -- Bart befriends a washed-up old Western star who turns out to be a raging alcoholic. This episode has some terrific one-liners (""Sorry don't suture my colon, son."").

""Blame It On Lisa"" -- The Simpsons go to, and wreak havoc in, Brazil. This episode is worth watching just for the T-shirt Homer wears on the beach: A picture of Uncle Sam devouring the globe with the caption, ""AMERICA - TRY AND STOP US.""

""Weekend and Burnsie's"" -- Homer on medical marijuana. Nuff said. (Except that the sequence where he is attacked by crows at the beginning is freaking hilarious).

""I Am Furious (Yellow)"" - An instant classic. Bart creates a cartoon about Homer called ""Angry Dad"" which briefly becomes an Internet sensation. A great send-up of the dot-com bust of the 90s.

""Little Girl in the Big Ten"" -- Lisa becomes a gymnast and is mistaken by her fellow girls as a college-age student, much to her delight. Unfortunately for her, Milhouse intervenes. This episode has one of the best and most ruthless Ralph Wiggum moments ever, and one of Homer's best manglings of a song lyric: ""I take a whiskey drink! I take a chocolate drink! And when I have to pee, I use the kitchen sink!""

""The Frying Game"" -- Although the ending of this episode is somewhat too ludicrous for a non-""Treehouse of Horror"" story, the opening plot, involving a EPA-protected insect called a ""screamapillar"" which lives on the Simpsons' property, which of course Homer is forced to take care of, is so freaking funny I choked on my Duff.

As I said, this is not the greatest Simpsons you will ever see. A good barometer of where the show was going was the strength of the ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes, and after season ten they were never quite as good, largely because the normal episodes became increasingly outrageous and thus weakened the impact of the Treehouse tales, whose strength was that they were not bound by the rules that governed the other stories. Also, this was the point where stories became more rigidly formulaic, to rely more on gags and one-liners than overall plots, and to depend too heavily on guest starts who very frequently brought nothing to the table. Having said all that, I laughed my butt off at more than half the episodes here and found Homer's stupidity and Bart's mischief to be just as engaging as it was back in the day. When Homer stares at Carmen Elektra's boobs and she indignantly says, ""My face is up here, Homer!"" he replies calmly: ""I've made my choice."" So have I. I'm moving on to Season 14."
986,1.0,"This is a freaking joke.
Terrible movie."
987,4.0,"Quite a few of these movies have been popping up lately: a horror / thriller film where characters are left stranded in one central location and the chills come not only from anything outside trying to encroach in but also the paranoia and the mental and emotional breakdowns of the characters. The Ruins I felt did this really well as it not only provided the gore and things you'd expect but provided some nice character moments of people losing sanity. Frozen goes for this kind of storytelling as well and actually did something that made me get interested in the film: the characters, or rather, character but I'll leave that for later. Watching Frozen knowing that director of gore-filled ""Hatchet"" Adam Green did this makes it kind of surprising like wow, more to this guy than gross stuff and while a couple of things hurt the film, I still found myself getting kind of tense as things get worse and worse.

The film centers on 3 characters, Dan (Kevin Zegers), Joe (Shawn Ashmore) and Dan's girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell) going to a ski resort on a Sunday to hit the slopes. Not wanting to spend the money on the ski lift, the 3 eventually talk the lift operator to let them on with a money bribe but thanks to Parker's escapades on the bunny hill, the trio never got any ""real"" ski time so before it closed, the 3 decides to take one last chance to ski the mountain but thanks to a misunderstanding, power shuts off, lights go off and the mountain won't re-open until Friday. It's too high up to jump off, wires connecting the chairs are too sharp to cross and the weather is dropping fast. Add to that, howling's heard off in the distance...

One thing that tends to be slightly hard to pull off in horror movies is to actually care about the characters. Sure in cases like slasher movies or movies about monsters, the characters are just there to show off how creatively they can be killed, but in a movie like Frozen, it's mandatory that we care about them since the gore will be relatively minor and there's no figure brandishing a sharp...something to fear. Frozen does it pretty well but mainly in the case of one character: Parker. Whether it's just my guyness not wanting a pretty girl to die or whether Emma Bell did a really good job making me care but I actually wanted her to survive the whole ordeal. The problem is with the other 2 is that they either have a certain personality or they do the ""lazy"" way of character building which are telling life stories. You know the ""back when I was 11, my father..."" type stories where instead of the actor providing a real feeling that this is a person, they just say some backstory and we're supposed to go ""oh now I sympathize with this person"". Ashmore does pretty well, same with Zegers but I actually wanted the character of Parker to live through the whole movie.

One thing the film doesn't do so well is the weird little things you'll be shouting at the characters in frustration. One character loses their glove and instead of sticking it in her pockets, she keeps it free to be put anywhere on a metal chair that's extremely cold. Characters suffer frostbite on their faces yet they don't zipper up their coats. One tractor operator is about to rescue them until he's called back but then a heavy ski equipment lands on his tractor. Something metal, so instead of going outside the tractor to figure out what the hell hit his vehicle with all that snow and frozen trees around...he keeps backing up. One character decides to jump...straight down onto his legs rather than let his side take the impact or least curl up, and even takes his skis off. They're might be more but that's something I noticed throughout the movie: those weird little contrivances that characters either don't do or they're just not possible. And there's one minor annoyance involving the wolves and considering what the film seems to be hinting could be the main character's fate, funny how they use the easier method.

Frozen is the kind of movie that you put on with a partner and you just let the film have fun freaking you out but when you decide to really pay attention to the film, a lot of things could get on your nerves. Not a complete indie triumph but it works pretty well. Just too bad I think Adam Green loves his gore too much to at least try to progress as a filmmaker."
988,3.0,"The Next Three Days is Paul Haggis', director of the 2006 Best Picture, Crash, latest film. I'm not the plot summarizing type, but I'll give it a shot. It stars Russell Crowe as John Brennan, a perfect husband that finds himself lost in life once his wife, Laura (played by Elizabeth Banks) is arrested for the murder of her boss, who she had a nasty argument with earlier in the very same day. Once she is arrested, which is early in the film, John goes through expected depression, and eventually arrives at the surprising conclusion to break her out. He then goes through the tedious (but you wouldn't tell from how swiftly the story moves along) process of planning, and preparation.

The Next Three Days is an entertaining film. Not as complex as one might expect from a prison break movie, but if you're one who can suspend your disbelief, and just enjoy it for what it is, you should find a fun ride in this. Let's be honest, most movies are first and foremost: ENTERTAINMENT. Every detail does not need to be laid out. I respect a director who has enough confidence in his audience's intellect, that he leaves out some things to allow the pace to flow.

Haggis does just that. Minor details like using a tennis ball to pick a car lock in a millisecond, or detectives that seem to be smarter and work a lot quicker than your average cop, are what force you to have to suspend you disbelief in order to really get into it. The suspense is quite thrilling. I had to remind myself that I wasn't a freaking Film Critic a couple of times, so that I could allow myself to have fun. But, all in all, I think the suspenseful and dramatic scenes hit the right emotions at the right times.

They never really came off as bogus or cheesy to me. There are even a bunch of funny moments sprinkled throughout. It's like Bourne for married people. The shaky cam, quick outfit changes, dramatic movie kills and all make their appearance here. And all for the good. The script is tight.

The musical score is good as well. I love that it was filmed on location in Pittsburgh and a later destination that will remain unidentified. What brings it down to me are the moments I mentioned above, when you're forced to suspend disbelief in order to accept some unrealistic things. That's such a huge deal in these kinds of movies, because the point is to make us feel like that could be us. Despite its flaws, I recommend it. Like I said, it's Bourne with older married people. If you like Bourne, which you should, or you suck, then you'll find something special in The Next Three Days."
989,5.0,Funniest freaking show since Seinfeld!!
990,5.0,"I love psych, and this episode was freaking awesome. Anyone who is a psych fan would love it. Gus as a fudge snowman was hilarious"
991,5.0,"What can I say, these guys are just freaking hilarious! I was hooked from the moment I tuned in to watch some episodes from the first season. Who knew it would be cool to try to keep up with a bunch of nerds, of course they do have a hot neighbor in Penny. You should definitely pick this one up!"
992,2.0,"I really hate to write a bad review of my absolute favorite show, but I don't have a choice.  Pretending things are all fine and well doesn't do anyone any good, and its intellectuality dishonest.

After the fans reacted to the tedium and poor casting choices of Season 3, there was a dedicated and phenomenal course change going into Season 4 that breathed a vibrant new breath of life into the series, and it thankfully dissolved the boring stagnation of black-eyed demons and Buffy-babe clones that was Season 3's unfortunate hallmark.  This welcomed renewal lasted until the finale of Season 5.  If you haven't seen Seasons 4 and 5, you need to watch it now!

Unfortunately the brilliance was short lived, and with Season 6 came the proverbial trainwreck.

I.  My first gripe is the overall writing.  Season 6 is filled with writers who wrote half-assed episodes using half-assed monsters that are a shameful parade of what this show used to be about.  In my prior reviews of Supernatural seasons, I said:

""The beauty of Supernatural for the first two years was it generally took lesser known monsters, urban legends, and other spooky stuff, and put a unique spin on it. The show would also introduce supernatural elements that were deliberately obscure, so if we didn't know about it from our own knowledge, we'd have to find out the details in real time with Sam and Dean. This kept things fresh by giving us a good mix of investigation and action.""

And:

""Another refreshing aspect of the show, is, it doesn't insult the audience. Existing horror conventions are borrowed, but almost all of them are updated into something new, as it successfully blends the insider info found in cult shows with the broader appeal of horror and action for the more mainstream audience. What we get is a hybrid of the two.""

Unfortunately Season 6 throws all of that away by giving us some of the most boring, rehashed, and lazy episodes to date.  This season was also plagued with pointless monsters.  For example: Did we really need several more episodes about vampires---perhaps the lamest and most overused monster in pop culture next to zombies?  What, in six seasons did the show run out of monster ideas?  What, there weren't enough monsters in mythology world-wide so they had to go back to the most stereotypical and highlighted monsters that can be found everywhere else?  Another trap the writers fell into was continuing to rip off other shows, but the acknowledging the original source material in-episode as if that clears them of lazy writing.  I mean, c'mon, the Supernatural writers have their own world to create with their own rules!  Why on Earth would they have to have insipid ""Anne Rice rules"" for vampires or ""Star Trek rules"" for mind-control worms?  At the very least, I'm thankful when they pointlessly brought in H.P. Lovecraft, they didn't have Cthulhu end up being the ""end boss"".  That would have been a stupid and monumental sell-out.

Along the same lines as above, I also have some issues with Sera Gamble, the replacement for Eric Kripke and the new creative head.  True to her name, her episodes are a gamble.  Like everyone, she has her pros and cons.  She is stunningly fantastic when she's writing the character of Death.  Her dialogue and plot writing for Death is solid gold.  But there-in lies the problem: she's a one trick pony, as most of the rest of her writing is dross.  Looking at all the episodes Gamble has written, she is perhaps the most uninspired and formulaic writer in the whole Supernatural stable.  With only a few exceptions here or there, too often her stories are just ripped off and repackaged plots tiredly taken from other sources.  The bottom line, is, I don't think she was the right choice to spearhead the show.  But Kripke seems to trust her, so maybe he sees something I don't.  Regardless, in the attempt to be fair, I'm still willing to give her a second chance with Season 7, but she has to step up her 'A Game' and get some new ideas to get this show moving in the right direction again.  Subpar or ""just ok"" episodes are not good enough, not when this show has been near-perfect in the past.

A final gripe I have about the writing, is: I wish certain writers would keep their damn politics out of the show.  [They know who they are.]  Neither political party seems capable of doing the right thing, and both are screwing us over.  But I don't need one side's particularly tiresome propaganda or slant shoved down my throat.  I tune into this show to escape all the b.s. political wrangling in the real world, so the last thing I want to see, is it crop up its ugly head in-fiction.  There is no place for that in the Supernatural, and it's just a stupid move on the part of the writers.  This country is literally divided 50/50, so it's beyond stupid to potentially alienate half of the audience just to throw in some snarky partisan politics.  If one wants to advertise their own political beliefs, they can do so on their own time.  We don't need that crap here, as this show should not be a vehicle for any petty politics.

II.  My second concern, is, this season started out very slowly and it needlessly ran us into several unnecessary dead ends that really didn't accomplish anything except waste our time, or kill off a few long-lasting guest star characters.  It also didn't seem to have a clear path.  The Purgatory arc might have been the overall plan, but it was painfully clear the first half of the season was just a shot in the dark by throwing anything and everything onto the wall to see what stuck.  And it was almost embarrassing watching each idea fail, and quickly be swept away.

One specific example was the absolutely worthless ""Grandpa Campbell & Cousins"" arc that utterly bombed.  I really like Mitch Pileggli and Colin Nemec, especially since they were both 'Stargate' alumni, but their talent was utterly wasted as one dimensional cardboard cut outs.  This was so painful and so pathetic, it even translated into the show inadvertently when cousin Mark becomes the first cannon-fodder casualty.  When he died, no one even batted an eye, no one said anything, and it was like he didn't even exist.  Ironic, as that's how I felt too!  There was not one ounce of character development given to Mark, thus his death had no more impact than swatting a mosquito.  [And the same mostly held true with the rest of the Campbell clan later on.]  For a show that sometimes tends to go overboard on the crying, whining, man-tears, and emotional roller coasters, I found it very disingenuous that no one would even care he died.  But more to the point, it was an example of poor writing.  The ""arc"" with Eve was just as bad.  Haphazard build up, quick resolution, and very little satisfaction because it was pretty clear in her final appearance that she was just shallow plot-filler and time-killer to get to the finale.

The most blatant and insipid travesty however, as the dreadful 'The French Mistake' episode that broke the fourth wall and tried to tell a story with the actors playing themselves.  It failed.  It failed miserably.  It wasn't funny, it wasn't clever, and it only severed as a lame and transparent self-indulgent piece for the crew that completely destroyed the suspension of disbelief.  'Wes Craven's New Nightmare' pulled the same stunt, but at least it tried to be serious.  Even 'Stargate SG-1' did a parody of itself, but that was both clever and funny.  The surname of this episode was aptly named.  It was a 'Mistake'.

III.  Third, it was even more apparent the show's budget is practically non-existent:  Almost no classic rock.  Almost no location shoots in the first half of the season and more ""we have to save money so all we can do is shoot in a warehouse or the studio backlot, and redress the sets over and over again and pray the fans don't notice"" than the first two years of the 'X-Files'.  This is fine with the running gag of the motel rooms, but it's not cool with full episodes.  A show that survived six seasons should be getting a bigger budget because it has proven itself capable of lasting, not the reverse by getting a smaller and small budget each year and sabotaging all that it had built up.  Then we have the monster farce: ""We don't have any money for special effects or monster costumes, so every monster including dragons will be humans with fangs or weird eyes to indicate different monster races.""  I mean c'mon, why even green-light a dragon episode when they couldn't do them to begin with?!  Yeah, like men in business suits really work as ""dragons""...  Boring!  That was a short cut the various Star Trek shows used, except in that case it was just regular humans with slightly different noses...

IV.  And finally, there's the pointless season finale.  Without giving away too much, it's just more of the same.  Of all the things they could do---of all the infinite possibilities of plot direction, the only thing they could think of, was to once again make us mistrust a good guy by seemingly turning someone evil.  Well yay...  Didn't we have to deal with that circular and done-to-death plot with Sam the last three years?  I mean c'mon, this is the best the show can come up with?  Drinking from the same well for the fourth time?!  And this was written by Kripke himself!  This endless farce of mistrust and corruption of the brothers or their allies is getting freaking old.  Been there, done that.  Ad nauseam.  Get some new material!  If the creative team or writing stable can't think of anything new for core character development, then they need to be replaced, or this show needs to end.  When I wrote my first review on Supernatural here on Amazon, I was floor by how brilliant it was, and I specifically mentioned how much I appreciated them taking their unique spin on things by being anti-formula.  But now I'm ready to drop the show---something unthinkable for me after the phenomenally good finale of Season 5, and I absolutely hate that I feel this way.  I love this show, I love the characters, and I love the idea behind it.  But man, they can do a helluva lot better than Season 6.

Taking into account all I said, this does not translate to the cast.  As usual, the acting is excellent, and I'm not at all criticizing them.  [Though with that said, it is high-time for Sam to get a hair cut!]  In fact, they were the only saving grace for me.  Sam, Dean, Bobby, and Cas were the only reasons I kept coming back to watch when I started getting disillusioned.

Yeah, this review was certainly a downer, and it pained me to write it.  But as I said before, with the bar having been set so high so early, I refuse to settle on anything less, and this season did not cut it.  It may be tolerable for fans of the actors or for more casual action/horror TV viewers, and that's cool.  But if you are a slightly more discriminating fan with a love of the show but no love for shortcuts or a drop in quality and presentation, this doesn't cut it.  Not by a long shot.  In fact, I can't even recommend purchasing this set, at least not until it drops in price.

To its credit, Supernatural has a history of taking into account fan concerns, and proactively righting a wayward course.  Hopefully things will get better in Season 7..."
993,5.0,"If you're a fan of horror, there's only one reason not to purchase this set...you already own all four movies. And depending on the quality of the prints you own, maybe you should consider treating yourself to an upgrade.

I previously reviewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Must-Be-Destroyed/dp/B0001FVE5O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed</a>, and encourage you to head on over to that product's page and read my review. ""Dracula Has Risen From The Grave"" is perhaps the high water mark of the Lee Dracula movies. Both films star legendary ""Hammer Girl"" Veronical Carlson. In the 40s, Universal Studios had Evelyn ""The Screamer"" Ankers. Decades later, Hammer had Veronica. Both films are textbook of examples of films that mix non-stop tension with gothic atmosphere and superb character development.

""Horror of Dracula"" and ""Curse Of Frankenstein"" were excellent and effective first steps for the Hammer Horror franchise. In all of the Frankenstein movies, the real monster is Peter Cushing....and he plays the role with megalomaniacal glee. Universal owned the rights to all of their monsters' makeup, so don't expect a bolt-necked Boris Karloff or Lon Chaney lumbering about. In ""Curse,"" the monster (played by Christopher Lee) basically looks like Christopher Lee pushed through a wood chipper. In ""Destroyed,"" it's a normal guy with a brain transplant...because this movie's raison d'tre is to show you just how freaking crazy the good baron actually is.

I'm convinced that when it comes to reviews of Hammer Horror films, the people who read them are less ""newbies"" and more Hammer fans who want to see what other fans have to say. Either way, if you love horror (especially well-crafted, atmospheric horror), you won't find a more essential addition to your library."
994,4.0,"Yes, this film had some freaking hilarious moments. BUT it also made me uncomfortable laughing at Islamic terrorist humor! The inept wanna-be terrorists are almost endearing (in a slightly sick way), but it also highlights the way that SOME Islamic people are indoctrinated with that whole ""America is evil, kill them and get 100 virgins in heaven"" bulls***. I thought the film would have been much funnier if the terrorist guys didn't actually kill anyone. I'll just leave it at that."
995,4.0,"I actually liked Robert Zemeckis' new film ""A Christmas Carol"", which surprised me.

A few years ago, Zemeckis began to use and develop his own motion capture technology. Basically, in motion capture, an actor wears a special suit with pinpoints all over it. A special camera films the live actor as they perform and this is transformed into an animated character. This technology allows the filmmakers to create a more human animated character with more fluid movements. The main advance of Zemecki's work seems to be they are able to use this same technique for facial expressions, allowing the characters to be more emotive and responsive to the action going on, The first film using this new technology, ""The Polar Express"" starring Tom Hanks in a number of roles, is a strange film. All of the people in the film look like zombies and have soulless eyes. The second film was ""Beowulf"" and it was a SLIGHT improvement, but not much. Now, we have a new retelling of Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol"" starring Jim Carrey as Scrooge and a number of other characters. A vast improvement.

There are a couple of things at work, contributing to make this film more enjoyable. In the past few years, the use of Digital 3-D has exploded and it seems particularly suited to animated films. Now, some studios will only release an animated film in 3-D. Why? The premium charged for the 3-D glasses helps the box office. And I don't mind paying the premium either, because this new 3-D technology is heads and shoulders above what we are used to. I decided to see ""A Christmas Carol"" in IMAX 3-D. If I thought regular old Digital 3-D was good, IMAX 3-D is AWESOME. There is a product trailer at the beginning, which makes you feel like you are being transported into the screen. The screen size, enhanced projection and great sound system all work in concert to create an almost immersive experience, exactly what 3-D is trying to accomplish in the first place.

When I initially heard about this film and the use of Zemecki's technique, I as skeptical. I just didn't like ""The Polar Express"" or ""Beowulf"" that much. Why is Zemeckis so enamored of this technology? He can have all of the actors on one completely bare soundstage and transport them to Victorian London. It must save a fortune to not have to physically create all of the sets, props, costumes, etc.

But from the first moment of the new film, you feel as though you are being transported to a new time and place. The book opens and we see the first words of the immortal tale and a line drawing before the drawing becomes the film, dropping us next to Scrooge as he inspects the dead body of Jacob Marley, his longtime business partner.

With each new scene, Zemeckis and his team recreate a different part or aspect of Victorian London and they leave no small detail untouched. Some of the scenes look like paintings, but in a good way, lush, beautiful and evocative of a different time and place. Others look dark and foreboding, scary and haunted. These compositions really seem to come to life and help to make the story seem real and authentic.

There are still some problems with this technology. They seem to have fixed the problem with the eyes, but now the characters have this weird look to the faces. For instance, Colin Firth plays Scrooge's nephew, Fred. Fred looks a lot like Colin Firth, but they have given the character a larger chin, a Jay Leno chin. I guess because Scrooge has the same. But the chin makes his face seem odd. Gary Oldman plays Bob Cratchit and he seems to be a short man, shorter than even Gary Oldman is in real life. To accommodate for this, they have made his head more squashed and round than it is. His face still looks like Gary Oldman, just squashed and round. Each of the characters looks like the actor portraying them, with 'make-up' enhancements, but their faces seem to be stretched onto mannequins, a little like examples of plastic surgery gone bad, like the skin is stretched a little too tight. This and the combination of the odd enhancements make most of the characters seem unpleasantly weird.

Because the filmmakers create the exact look and feel of the characters, one actor can play multiple roles.  Jim Carrey plays Scrooge as an old man and at different times throughout his life and all three Ghosts of Christmas. Carrey does an excellent job and brings Scrooge to life, making him seem like the most despising miser ever. The film opens with Scrooge visiting his recently deceased partner Jacob Marley at the funeral home. Convinced his partner is dead, he pauses the undertaker and quickly takes the coins resting on Marley's eyes. Seven years later, when he returns home on Christmas Eve, he walks through his dark house, reluctant to light lamps. He gives his assistant, Bob Cratchit, a dressing down for merely looking at a new lump of coal as he shivers uncontrollably at his desk in the cold office. But then you probably know all of this already because I have no doubt you have seen at least one version of this story already.

Carrey has already proven he is an adept comedian, willing and able to do just about anything for a laugh. He has also done some good work in more dramatic roles. In ""A Christmas Carol"", he does more dramatic work giving a real depth to Scrooge and all of his personal prejudices against the poor, his family, happiness. At one point, there is an extended chase that feels odd, almost as though it has been included to up the comedy level, to ensure Carrey has access to some slapstick.

I find it odd that Carrey is listed as the actor providing the voice for the Ghost of Christmas Present. In the film, this ghost is represented as a semi-opaque black specter, very scary and very much like you would imagine a ghost to be. But this ghost doesn't have a face and I don't think he utters a single word. What exactly did Carrey do to portray this character? Stand and point?

The Ghost of Christmas Past looks the most like Carrey, like the filmmakers used his face and simply pasted it on a flame. The Ghost of Christmas Present looks like a cross between Santa Claus and Jim Carrey. What I am describing to you probably sounds very familiar, again because you have no doubt seen another version of this same story.

Zemeckis and his team have done a great job of making all of the familiar bits of the book look real and they have adapted the book in a way that seems more faithful. For instance, the Ghost of Christmas Future is a scary specter and would give anyone a fright. It actually might be the scariest representation of the ghost I have ever seen. Marley's Ghost is also pretty terrifying and the darkness, the cavernous of Scrooge's lonely, empty home has been brought to life in a way that most film adaptations couldn't even attempt. Strangely, the spaces don't only look real, they seem to have depth.

The depiction of Victorian London, at Christmastime, is really beautiful. Even the dirty, rundown, awful parts they show look like you would imagine Victorian London to be. But the good parts? These moments are what many of us think Christmas should be like. It really puts you in the spirit for Christmas.

Which makes me wonder why Disney released the film so freaking early? November 9th? I know they didn't want to compete with Avatar for 3-D screens, but releasing the film three weeks before Thanksgiving when people just aren't in the mood yet? If I were Disney I would have switched the release dates of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"". The traditionally animated ""Princess"" would have already transformed the box office. Instead, ""A Christmas Carol""'s box office seems a little miserly."
996,4.0,"This in my mind, was a good ppv, but the cover had a terrible screen shot of the brawl between team Cena and team Nexus. But thanks for reading and please rate!

Intercontinental Title
Dolph Ziggler vs. Kofi Kingston
This had the potential to be a good match, but everyone knew that this wasn't going to go down a good road. This match was just ruined by Nexus beating the living Day Lights out of Ziggler and Kingston telling Team Cena they are ready for the main event. 2/5

Divas Title
Melina vs. Alica Fox
So far, why do i even bother writing a review for this ppv, this ppv wasn't having a good start to it, which kind of dissapointed me. But, the only good thing about this was seeing Ziggler get beatdown by Nexus, and Melina winning the Divas title for the freaking second time. 1/5

3-on-1 Handicap match
Big Show vs. S.E.S(CM Punk, Joey Mercurey, and Luke Gallows)
Well, this match was another waste of time. This is how they were buring Punk first by making S.E.S disband, and then never winning once against the big slow. i mean, the nexus did a better job of beating the living blubber out of Show on smackdown for god sakes. This match had nothing special at all, except for of course domination from show. 2/5

WWE Title-If Orton Lost he would not get a rematch, if anyone interferred, they would be suspended idefinatly
Sheamus vs. Randy Orton
This, right here, was a great match. It actually turned out better than i thought it would be. This had great, never ending action. But this had a really retarted ending to it. For Sheamus to get DQed and for him to get off easy, but you think he did, very very false. After the match, Orton gave Sheamus one of the biggest RKO's ive seen this year on the announce table. 4.75/5

World Title
Kane vs. Rey Mysterio
This had the potential to be a good match, like their encounters in 08'. But it was short, sweet, and to the point. Especially for Undertaker getting hurt at wrestlemania, and returning at Summerslam 2 years in a row. But, this was almost even the entire match, until Kane won and and then Tombstoned Taker into next week, which made me very made by the way. 3.75/5

7-on-7 Tag Team Elimination match
Team WWE(Cena, Morrison, Truth, Hart, Edge, Jericho, and Bryan) vs. Team Nexus(Barrett, Otunga, Slater, Tarver, Sheffield, Young, and Gabriel)
This of course was the best match on the card. Over 35 minuets of awesome, and the huge return of Daniel Bryan, and the nice brawl before the match even started. One thing i did think was wrong with this match, elminations went really quickly, after one elimination, another elimination came after that about a minuet later. But, of course it came down to the biggest stars, Gabriel, Barrett(Nexus), and Bryan, and Cena(WWE), but of course, Cena Would wint he match for his team, which made me POed because the really needed for Bryan to win for his team because it was his return. 5/5

So, overall, now that i have looked at it, this was a average ppv, with only about 2 or 3 good matches on it. Thanks for reading."
997,2.0,"Had this been a B-level ppv show, such as a Night of Champions or Extreme Rulez, this would have been considered only a slightly below average show.  But when one takes into account the fact that, buyrate wise, SummerSlam is the WWE's 3rd biggest event of the year (and their biggest event of the summer), it is unfair to say that this was a remotely good show.  As far as SummerSlams go it was one of the worst there's ever been.  In my opinion, only the 1989, 1990, and 1996 editions were worse than this one.  There were only two good matches on the show, and one of them had one of the worst and most destructive finishes (business wise)that there has been in pro wrestling in a long time.  In conclusion, do not buy this dvd.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1) Intercontinental Championship Match
Dolph Ziggler (c) w/ Vickie Guerrero vs. Kofi Kingston

This was a weird one, and not particularly good.  They wrestled for about 6 or 7 minutes before starting to go into some near falls, which the crowd got into, but other than that this was as basic as it gets.  Dolph then locked on a sleeper, was about to win, seemingly, and then Nexus came out and destroyed Kofi, thus ending the match in a no contest.  Normally this would have bothered me, but considering this was built as a one match show, it helped get Nexus over that much more and I was fine with that.  Plus nobody paid to see this match anyway.  *1/2

2) Diva' sChampionship Match
Alicia Fox (c) vs. Melina

I have seen worse women's matches, but this was quite atrocious.  Half-way through the match they worked a spot where Melina acted as though she hurt her knee agai, almost like a shoot, but then seconds later she jumped off the top rope and sold no pain whatsoever.  Even funnier than that, was that Alicia saw her ""injure her knee,"" and then proceeded to work over her upper body.  I laughed.  Melina won with a move that nobody thought was her finisher and she got no reaction...I mean zero.  Bad match.  DUD

Afterwords Laycool came out and wound up beating up Melina because she didn't want to take pictures with them.  Yee Haw.

3) 3 on 1 Handicap Match
Big Show vs. S.E.S. (CM Punk, Luke Gallows, & Joey Mercury) w/ Serena

This fued has done nobody any favors, and Big Show won what was basically a squash match.  Really nothing to it and the crowd did not care at all.  Show basically took turns beating on them, and aside from a short period of time when they tried hurting his hand, this was all Big Show.  Not a bad match per say, just a nothing match.  *1/2

After this ordeal the Miz came out and cut a SUPERB promo, essentially saying he was going to join Cena's team.  This was, in all honesty, the best part of the entire show.  If you actually make the mistake of buying this dvd, watch this and nothing else.

4) WWE Championship Match
Sheamus (c) vs. Randy Orton

The first good match on the show.  Not a really good match, but good enough.  Match started out extremely slow, and extremely boring.  It was every Randy Orton/ Sheamus match you've ever seen.  Lots of stomps, etc...However, it built pretty well and the last 5 minutes or so were very heated and enjoyable.  Right when the match was peaking, however, Sheamus brought a chair into the ring, got tangled with the ref, and was disqualified.  What a horrendous finish this was.  This wasn't even a B-show finish, not to mention the finish to a WWE Championship match at SummerSlam.  Just appalling, and the crowd HATED it, especially considering how awful the show had been so far.  After the match, Orton went insane and RKO'd Sheamus on the announce table, but it didn't break.  That had to suck.  Match was pretty good but would have been much better and higher rated had it not been for the offensively terrible finish.  ***

5) World Heavyweight Championship Match
Kane (c) vs. Rey Mysterio

Kane brought a casket with him to the ring, just to make sure everyone on earth knew that Undertaker would come out of it later.  Very average world title match.  Crowd was absolutely dead silent during the whole match, and the announcers even made note of the ""hush"" that fell over the crowd.  I laughed.  Every Kane/Mysterio match you've ever seen.  Kane eventually hit a chokeslam for the win.  **1/4

Kane went to put Mysterio in the casket, when to everyone's (no one's) surprise Undertaker came out.  He teased attacking Rey, but then let Rey go and tried Chokeslamming Kane.  But, you see, Undertaker is not as strong as he once was, due to his stay in a vegetative state, and Kane was able to power out and Tombstone his brother.  Crowd did not like this or know what to make of it, but to be honest this was at least an interesting twist.

6) Team WWE (John Cena, Bret Hart, Edge, Chris Jericho, Daniel Bryan, R-Truth, & John Morrison)
vs.
Team Nexus (Wade Barrett, Skip Sheffield, David Otunga, Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel, Michael Tarver, & Darren Young)

Daniel Bryan replaced Miz before the match started, as everyone knows.  Very long match, 35 min +.  This was the best match on the show, and it was very good, but at the same time it really was nothing special and probably below the standards of what a usual SummerSlam main event should be.  Most everyone looked good, even Bret Hart for the brief amount of time he was in.  Otunga, however, was freaking horrendous.  Like, he can't even run the ropes.  Just terrible. Slater, Gabriel, and even Sheffield (shockingly) all impressed me.  Unfortunately, the finish was absolutely horrific.  The last thing in the world WWE should have done was beat Nexus clean in their first ppv match, and that's exactly what they did.  It came down to Bryan and Cena against Gabriel and Barrett.  Miz came out and murdered Bryan with his briefcase, and then it was down to 2 on 1.  Gee, I wonder what's gonna happen now.  Cena got beat on for almost 10 minutes, including a DDT on the exposed concrete on the outside.  Then Gabriel missed his 450 splash, got pinned, and Barrett ran in, walked right into an STF, and tapped clean in the middle of the ring in a couple seconds.  Just wretched.  I mean, vomit starting to rise up your throat wretched.  WWE better start getting some heat back for Nexus, because this finish hurt them quite significantly, in my opinion, and was just another example of WWE being terrified to put young talent over established stars.  ***1/2, but with the right finish it could have been more.

What a disgraceful show this was.  Stay as far away as possible.  This was the 23rd SummerSlam and it was easily one of the top 5 worst there's ever been."
998,5.0,I freaking love this movie
999,4.0,"RED is not bad, for a movie about bunch of old retired agents who become targets by the same government they once killed for. R.E.D. stands for ""Retired and Extremely Dangerous,"" and that's exactly what they are. The cast of RED is questionable for an action movie on paper (except for John McClane), but after seeing them all in action, it's better than I ever imagined. I had neutral expectations for this film, and I'm happy to say it's a pleasant surprise. Bruce Willis is as great as he's been in a while. That isn't saying much because he has not had much energy lately, but the rest of the cast picks up his slack tenfold. John Malkovich is amazing. He is genuinely hilarious. I thought it took some kind of special skill to make people laugh every time you spoke. He isn't a comedian, but whatever it is, he has it. The man is pure comedic genius in this movie. See it for him if nothing else. Malkovich isn't it though. There is also Helen Mirren in a fur coat and military boots, with a big @ss gun. Something worth mentioning is that they trained her well with those guns. The lady did not blink or close her eyes when shooting, like I'd expect her to. Just a straight face. I loved that. I really believed she was a trained killer. She is badass beyond words, yet manages to stay classy. How does she do it? The Queen with a freaking sniper rifle? Yes. And there is also Morgan Freeman. His last role was a President, now he's a retired agent. And he's great in his role, but don't expect to see him for too long.

The rest of the cast is good too. Ernest Borgnine made me smile in his tiny role, and I enjoyed Richard Dreyfuss. Yeah, the cast is full of older actors, but you won't be able to tell. I have to say that Mary Louise Parker was a little annoying at times, but she doesn't hinder the movie overall. The performances are great, but what else is there? The comedy aspect of the film is better than the action to be honest. I laughed a lot, and so did the rest of the audience. There are a couple of action scenes that will make you cheer though. Mainly the airport scene. I won't go into detail, but I think everyone will like that part, despite their feelings on the rest of the movie. Besides what I've mentioned, there isn't too much to else to the movie. I enjoyed the locale hopping. It was sort of Bond-like, but it stayed within the U.S. I also enjoyed the plot. It was slightly complex, but very easy to follow for the dimwits in the audience. No offense, to those of you who are dimwitted. :P I think this is a movie that will be very enjoyable to those of you who can ignore slight inconsistencies in the narrative and just enjoy the mayhem. Go see it!"
1000,5.0,i freaking love Sherlock and i was ecstatic to finally buy my own copy! dvd worked great with no scratch or glitches which is usually my concern when buying a dvd
1001,5.0,I'm freaking obsessed!!! This is worst than Game of Thrones.
1002,3.0,"I had very high hopes for this movie.  The trailers were fantastic and I have always enjoyed the Robin Hood story be it in the Prince of Thieves, Disney, or Men in Tights versions.  Robin Hood is just an interesting character with a great persona and mission.

It seems that typically Robin has been portrayed as a pretty boy.  I think Russell Crowe did a great job blowing that aspect away.  I'm not trying to saying Crowe is as ugly as a mud fence, I'm just saying he appears to be more of a rough outdoors type.  He has more of a worn soldier look, which I think fits the character better, especially living in the woods and running from the law constantly (that just can't be good for your youthful look).

I also like that Scott took this film in the direction of a prequel.  It is so hard to come up with a back story to a character like Robin, especially someone that is suspected to have been a real person, but is not supported by any real concrete evidence.  Marion is referred to as Marion Loxley, and its very interesting to see her and Robin together as simple aquaintances rather than a romantic item.  It gives a little more depth to their relationship.  Cate Blanchett plays an awesome part as Marion by the way.  Another stand-out character was Mark Addy as Friar Tuck.  Tuck to me has always played an important part in Hood stories, just as much if not more so than Robin himself, and Addy just does such a good job with Tuck.  Such comic relief and memorable instances. Danny Houston, Oscar Isaac, Matthew Macfadyen, I'm just sorry but I don't think they spent very much time on your characters so I'm going to have to say, boring portrayals of King Richard, Prince John, and Nottingham Sheriff.  Kevin Durand was a great Little John and was actually well supported by Robin's other followers.  All together they made quite a funny group that I think really added to this movie.

Now for the parts I don't like (usually I do these first, but it just seems more fitting in this situation to do them last)

1- King Richard was killed off way too fast.  I would have liked to see more of Richard, or a possibility of a return.  As in the Disney Robin Hood where Richard returned at the end to overthrow Prince John, I think Richard should have been kept available for a comeback.  Such a good character and it seems a shame to get rid of him.  Potential for a future antagonist or protagonist, but not now.  Granted, it did work into the story, so at least it wasn't completely senseless.

2- The movie is just so...lacking.  There is just that element that would put it over that is missing.  It exists.  You don't want to say it wasn't a good movie but you really can't think of anything good to say about it either.  It just plays with you too much, there is so much potential and so much to keep your attention that you can't turn away.  Its not boring, but its not entertaining.  The only thing I really know to compare it to is a day of unsuccessful deer hunting.  You got to do something, the potential for something great to happen was there, but in the end what did you really walk away with?

3- Robin was noted in the movie as being an exceptional archer.  Not an extremely gifted archer, but exceptional.  However, he hardly ever shoots a bow!  In the big battle scene at the beach (climax of the movie) hes running around swinging a freaking sledge hammer! What sense did that make?  If I was the Craig Harrison of bow shooting, why not post up on a ridge?  Ride horse back through firing arrows but come on, a hammer?  *SLIGHT SPOILER* The best part of the whole movie was at the end, where the Sheriff of Nottingham is posting WANTED posters for Robin, he asks ""Where is a nail?"" and an arrow comes flying out of the woods and pins the poster to a tree and everyone starts laughing.  Some guy stands up in the theater I was in and yells ""Who the **** shot that?!""  I couldn't help but scream ""Robin Hood dumb @$$!"" and of course the whole theater starts laughing.  Come on, who shot the arrow?

All in all, its a good watch for a lazy Sunday.  Like I said, its not great but its not bad.  The good I see in this is, there are plenty of chances to expand.  The back story is out of the way and now we can make some real Robin Hood action go on.  Nice prequel but I just don't think this will stand alone as a movie."
1003,5.0,"I love this movie and I am 35. This is funny and mostly clean except for the word ""freaking"" a couple of times. I thought the story was good and the kids thought it was okay."
1004,5.0,"Question one: Can there be ""good"" torture porn?
Answer: a qualified ""yes"", if you mean: artfully done. Masterfully accomplished.
I'll defend this at some other point, but right here I'll just add that I think gore hounds and scream queens and body melt fans and all the quibbling critics in the horror world should just band together and say that when David Edelstein coined the term ""torture porn"" he hit the nail right on the head. It is a freaking awesome name for a really twisted sub genre that only a few can handle, and that's how it should be.
Which brings me to the Collector, who is not only a seminal figure in Torture Porn, but also the second scariest on screen serial killer I have seen...
I used to doubt my judgment on that. I would say: but the guy's no Hannibal Lecter, right? And Lecter won the Oscar, which means he's the quality king, mother approved, case closed. Right?
Absolutely not.
Remember when&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannibal/dp/B001KT6JPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannibal</a>&nbsp;came out and all sorts of exposition and background stuff about Hannibal Lector came to the foreground and the dude just went from scary to frankly goofy.
Well get this: Nobody ever, not once, gives us a hint at what is driving the Collector.
Well, surely a smart analyst would start piecing apart the things that the Collector says to, say, his victims. Or the cops who are pursuing him.
But dig this. The Collector never speaks. Not here at least. Not word one. All you have are his torture porn misdeeds, which are graphic and in your face and reprehensible...
And the way the man flipping MOVES.
Two words for you: Juan Fernndez. Can I hear some love? The man has a touch of Chaplin. He has a touch of  Mikhail Baryshnikov. He is absolutely perfect.
So yes, you will see some stuff that is absolutely obscene and which you might never forget...but I'm guessing if you're reading this review, this is maybe not an issue for you.
So please check it out and please send Mr. Fernndez some fan mail. I don't know the man, but he has earned it."
1005,5.0,"One word for this movie: holysonofajesustapdancingS#!+areyoufreakingkiddingme!? Alright. Let me slow down and collect myself for a moment.  How are you with completely insane asian cinema? Do the letters&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TGP/dp/B00393SG1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TGP</a>&nbsp;make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside? Have you ever enjoyed a film that was deliberately and unapologetically moronic and WRONG? Have you love for the neo-Japanese grindhouse, my friend? If so, welcome to it's masterpiece.  Yoshihiro Nishimura: you complete me. The man known as the Tom Savini of Japan has gotten progressively bolder and more accomplished with his trademark twisted over-the-top sensibilities and has grown in leaps and bounds as an effects artist in a very short time. Leading Japan's underground cinema into the new millennium, he has contributed effects to films such as Suicide Circle and Meatball Machine, and joined up with partner-in-crime Noboru Iguchi for Machine Girl (a personal fave) before becoming a nearly one-man show writing, directing, AND doing special effects for the monstrously bizarre Tokyo Gore Police.  After a quickie gig doing the effects for Samurai Princess, he reteamed with Iguchi-san to co-direct this slice of horror-comedy heaven. Now, if any of these films rings a bell, you know exactly how demented these two are. Ever wonder what their idea of romance is?

 Allow me to recount the events of the opening scene of Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein Girl, if you will. After a needless introduction to Japanese high school Valentines Day traditions a cute girl wearing a hood and her male companion are attacked on the road by three female undead atrocities. She bites the first in the neck and peels the skin off of it's head with her teeth as if it were an apple to reveal a bloody skull (eyes still in sockets, of course). She then head butts the girl, sending the skull flying into the face of the second enemy. The skull gnaws away at the face of it's comrade, sending gallons of the red, red kroovy splashing all over the lens and everything else within a half mile as our heroine spits out the very long strap of flesh she unwrapped from the first undead girl's skull. As the killer skull pulls the second undead's face off, the vampire girl bites her own wrists to utilize the Japanese vampiric ability of forming weapons from her blood (a'la the naime Nightwalker) She then beheads the second girl with her blood swords and the still-staring skulls land as a neat stack of two. Undead girl number three attacks and is relieved of both arms at once in a flurry of arterial spray. She is then slowly impaled through the crotch as J-pop singing begins to overpower the groovy surf music that has served as the soundtrack to this carnage thusfar. At this point, I literally raised my hand in a metal sign and nodded in approval with a mile-wide smile on my face even though I was in the room alone with nobody to note my visible pleasure at the ridiculousness of what i just saw. That's how much I enjoy this kind of garbage. The last would-be killer's skull is lifted out of it's skin from below and the film's title fades into view as our heroine lifts it and smiles from beneath her hood before tossing the final skull perfectly on top of the other two. Frankenstein: 0, Vampire: 3. My friend, we have not yet reached the 5 minute mark of this hyper-offensive gore-fest. Imagine what the other 80 minutes hold. I dare you..... Yeah, it's even crazier than that.

Often have I partaken in the wonderland that is the neo-Japanese grindhouse and seldom have I come away disappointed, but this film just takes the cake for me. It's like a perfect storm of violence, offensive stereotypes,and general insanity. Plus for the first time, the special effects actually look halfway good. TGP and Machine Girl were both brought down a notch by the fakeness of some of the effects (to be fair, with the things they were trying to do in TGP there was no way to not make it look bad). While James Cameron need not live in fear of movies like Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein Girl dominating the special effects scene, for a low-budget flick of this nature they do look mighty fine. But what really put me over the moon for this one was the sheer light-hearted zaniness of it. Sure they are all zany, but this one is practically a musical at times. A musical engineered by a band called Blood-Stained Fellow. I want this soundtrack. There's the aforementioned surf music and J-pop, along with metal, psychobilly, and even a showtune. That's right. Showtune. And it's used in possibly the greatest, bloodiest, and most excessive vampire kill scene ever to awesome effect. Not good awesome, mind you. Bad awesome. As in ""so bad it's awesome"".  Oh, and you know the flying guillotine? Yeah, imagine that was made out of spinal column and a rib cage. Voila!  Bad awesome!

Good god, I don't even know how to describe some of this stuff to you it's so overpoweringly off-the-wall. Well, at the high school where this tale of two girls who love the same boy takes place there are clubs. One such club is dedicated to the art of cutting yourself. These girls are so hardcore that at the school's Wristcutting Rally (whoever gets the most blood in the bucket wins) a chick SAWS THROUGH HER OWN ARM with a razor blade. And she still doesn't win! That's gonna leave a mark.  Another club is dedicated to Japanese girls who wish they were born black. There aren't words to describe to you how completely offensive these scenes are. There just aren't. You have to see it for yourself. Just.......damn, you won't believe it until you see it. There's also a sexy psycho-killer nurse, a hunchback janitor, a Chinese teacher with lungs filled with smog (a sharp jab at China's environmental trangressions) who is prone to going on tangents about certain popular J-horror films (allow me to point out that the director of those films plays the role, which makes it even funnier) in the middle of his lectures. And guess what? All of these things play vital roles in the story. They aren't there just to be retarded even though they fulfill that function nicely. What else do I like? How about an ending that's a raggedly-veiled homage to Sweden's sophisticated vampire film Let the Right One In? How's that for contrast?

 Pretty much every frame of this film is filled with bizarreness. As I said, there really aren't words. This is my favorite film I've seen in 2010 so far. Now, take that with a grain (or pillar) of salt because this film obviously is not for everyone, but if you can appreciate the audacity of a story whose goal is to cram as much off-the-wall nonsense, violence, and absurdist humor into 90 or so minutes then proceed with confidence and prepare to have your jaw dropped. If you cannot enjoy the simple pleasures of insanity for inanity's (not a typo) sake then consider this a pass. But those who enjoy this sort of trash should be better than pleased. Pretty ladies, gallons of blood, a sensibility that makes beyond absurd seem mundane, the most charming vamp you'll ever see, and a hottie with detachable limbs (she uses an electric screwdriver) and screws sticking out of her face; a match made in grindhouse heaven.  I adore it. Vampire Girl vs Frankenstein Girl: place your bets, folks and don't say I didn't warn you."

1007,3.0,"I first popped this movie in expecting to be drawn in fast but I quickly got distracted doing something and pretty soon there was screaming like crazy in the cave and im like seriously what happened? So right i would go back and than get distracted again!!!...I finally just sat on my couch and determined as  all Heck to watch this movie all the way through. This movie was eh there was the obvious diving scenes that was pretty cool and I loved hearing them talk even though I ended up not really caring WHAT they were saying! I think there was some parts that could have been cut out like a lot of the fighting, i got it that daddy and son don't get along from their little chat on the screen so I didn't care for when they were arguing for how many minutes. It annoyed me that Josh blamed his father for that lady drowning...she was freaking tired. he should have demanded her to stay but since she went she wasn't in the state of mind and panicked so fast. I know nothing about diving but I'm sure that if she had gotten rest, her thoughts would have been a lot more clear. When the storm was first starting and those four people were coming back up and they started screaming and dadada, i think they could have made that scene into a 2 minute than instead of what it was. I loved George's character, when he got decompression sickness and was dying that made me upset. It really annoyed me when they were like telling Frank not to drown that one guy that broken every bone in his body like really, so you gonna let him be in pain? i was thinking you are idiots. When Frank and his son made it to where that military thing was they could have done something to get out in my opinion, and than why go back?!?! And all that drama between Karl between Frank and Josh my god....cut that whole crap out...Freaking psycho he deserved to get left alone in the first place. OOH and about his girlfriend if you are unexperienced why they heck are you going down there? I thought Karl said that they met at another expedition that maybe she knew something but than Frank was she came down here knowing nothing, mistake number one and mistake number 2....blah blah blah...where was the sense from her and her boyfriend obviously not where its supposed to be!!! When the son drowned his daddy cuz he was hurt and slowly dying, not gonna lie it made me tear up cuz at that point you just saw that the boy finally understood his father. But ya know after the father died, I really didn't care if Josh made it or not. I think Frank should have gone all the way, he got everyone to the point where they were and yea he should have been the one to conquer it...but eh whatevs..... I think if you enjoy watching movies about people going to unknown places and something happens to them that they start dying off than you may enjoy this movie....if not than you may not. if you are weary rent it....no harm in it!!"
1008,2.0,"Red Riding Hood really doesn't deserve 2 stars.  It is really that outrageously bad.  I suppose I gave it 2 stars because it has certain ""production values"" that are somewhat interesting and, yes, it has Gary Oldman, who I am a big fan of, in spite of the fact that he plays a completely ridiculous character in this turkey.  My big question is--along with probably most people who have sat through this-is what in the hell is with that big, freaking metal elephant?  Who came up with such an absurd idea in the first place?  And the whole werewolf bit?  It's just all so incredibly STUPID and worse, badly scripted.  This flick almost makes the whole Twilight movie thing seem good and that's just scary.  The director would have done well to sit down and study Snow White and the Huntsman to see how to take an old story and breath new life into it.  But then again, I think this particular story for this particular purpose was DOA to begin with.  Again, 2 stars is being very generous."
1009,5.0,"I just don't know whats wrong with alot of people as far as movie fans or sci-fi fans go, and especially so-called movie critics with their love of films that nobody ever freaking watches. I thought this was a really interesting film which came out last year before this years alien invasion movie stampede, the actors who seem to be mainly T.V. actors although I have seen Eric Balfour in a few things before, all seem to be very believable as this invasion unfolds. The special effects with its spaceships, huge alien creatures and semi mechanical alien flyers all looked real, in fact alot of Battle LA's alien hardware looked alot like those, also it almost seems like Skyline's story and Battle LA could have been about the same alien invasion the way they both looked. I also found this film alot more entertaining than Super 8 which I just saw as you had to go thru alot of the same Speilberg territory just to get to the parts of what everybody really went to see that film about in the first place. But being a scifi and film fan anyway from way back, I guess I just appreciate something, especially a scifi film that really holds my interest and is not a part of the crap you see that alot of todays films and epecially television consist of."
1010,4.0,"I liked this movie. The 3d was decent, would have been great if it wasn't so freaking dark all the time. It's nice to see a movie get back to what vampires are, blood sucking death machines who'd rather rip your throat out than look at you. There's no cry baby vampire wannabe's like in Twilight, if the vamps from that movie ran into Jerry they'd pee themselves!

minor spoiler.

I liked that the original Jerry had a brief cameo in the movie. I also like that they kept a the originals flavor just modernized and even more dark with less 80's fluff."
1011,4.0,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this.  As a big fan of the original, I thought, ""not again.""  But dang, this is GOOD.  It really works hard to keep the same light-hearted tone of the original while updating the story quite nicely.  I mean, things have changed a lot in the last 25 years and if you want to make a story like this work, it's either a period piece or modern day, that's it.  The cast is great. Farrell is so freaking sexy mean that he reminds you of what a vampire is supposed to be. This has some fun FX, good laughs, a few decent scares and great cinematography and music.  The source material is obviously well-regarded by the filmmakers.  Sad, though, there were only about 20 people in the theater when I saw this.  Most were easily over 35.  The new vampire fans don't seem to be interested and it's a shame."
1012,5.0,"When I saw this in theatre, I felt like it would be one of my all-time favorite movies.  I rarely watch movies more than once, but I can watch this over and over.  I swear the ending is different than the cinema version, though, and this version has a little less punch.  Rooney Mara is so freaking good in this role, it is just killer.  Her facial expressions are amazing.  Have not watched any other features, so cannot comment on that."
1013,3.0,"I didn't see any ads etc for this so it was all new to me upon first (and rather likely last) viewing. Unlike most reviewers here, the alien sex scenes didn't bother me a bit, but merely confirmed how irredeemably goofy this flick is.

In fact, I'd wager that we'll be seeing more human/alien sex scenes in the next few years, so you might want to acclimatize. We're getting more and more hints in the media that not only may there be life out there in the trillions of planets (gosh, what are the odds?!), but who knows? Maybe WE are already alien/simian hybrids! It would certainly offer one of the few viable explanations as to how we're the only species on earth that reliably destroys its environment over and over. Remember that speech by Mr. Smith in The Matrix about how humans are a cancer on this planet? He might be a lot too accurate.

In any case, to me the alien sex scene was a whole lot less disturbing than what we see on the news every night. My tax dollars killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians...now THAT is truly disturbing. Whereas this movie is fiction. Our actions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam and elsewhere are not. It's fascinating how we've been conditioned to regard massive violence and military massacres as no problem, but we can't even see a pair of breasts on tv without freaking out about morality...even alien breasts that don't really exist.

But beyond all that, Splice fails on so many fronts. The script misses endless chances to explore the ethics of interspecies gene splicing, the acting is weak at best (thought Sarah Polley had us hating her character pretty early on; she's very good at being annoying), and the pacing is mixed. Despite all that, we were entertained by it all, bad and good. It's shot pretty well, has a few amusing moments, and did hold our interest (even if it was just disbelief). Brody adds little, but Dren is quite entertaining...I like how she suddenly reveals whatever genetic accoutrements she needs, from wings to gills to a fully-loaded interstellar credit card (but only on the European dvd version).

Dren was what made this worth sitting through, for me, and the concept raises enough questions and few enough answers to really make one ponder what is Right and what is Wrong...and if there even is such a dichotomy anymore. In fact, the best part for me was the ending (big spoilers coming); it makes perfect sense (and gets us sequel-ready) that the non-Heroine gets pregnant by an alien with her own dna...that's a near perfect metaphor for modern life! We're so far up our own butts we have no idea what's ""right"" any more, and you can bet that we'll be seeing interspecies slicing any day.

In fact, it's almost a sure bet that the military is already doing it in their various black ops, and like I said it's also a fair bet that we are all carrying non-terrestrial dna around as well. We seem to give first use of all new tech to the military, so who knows how we'll first learn of it...a fake alien attack to promote a one-world government? Now there's a movie just waiting to be made. Or a ""reality"" already prepped for release..

All in all, I'd recommend Splice if you enjoy bouncing all sorts of concepts around in your head, and are willing to withstand weak acting and writing in exchange for the chance to ponder many imponderables. Because what was once imponderable is now quite within the realm of ""reality"", and despite Splice's many failings, it raises plenty of thoughts worth thinking. The blu-ray has a good transfer, btw, and its detail shows how good the cgi on Dren was, at least.

And to all you folks who were omg SO grossed out by the alien sex scene, let me ask you this: if you found out that the only way you could cure your child of a fatal disease was by someone, even you, having sex with an alien...might you not suddenly reconsider your moral stance? Stem cell research is but one step away from that, and one thing we've proven as a species is that when it all comes down to it, it ain't all for one and one for all, it's one for one. We're a mighty selfish bunch, and who knows what lines we'll cross to preserve our all-important personal dna...wherever it might be from."
1014,5.0,"Some of ep2, pilot, got a little weird... when RJ's parents were talking to there friends at the dinner table... little awkward.

For the most part though, freaking hilarious. Especially when his pants fell down. I thought it was going to be cliche, but it was all turned on its head.

If you want to laugh. Watch this.

It'd be nice to see the main character grow as an individual and gain some bravery and put on some muscle as well as loose some of the dorkyness... but that probably will not happen."
1015,5.0,"The Loved Ones is one of my top favorite Australian horror movies. It's got a great story, fantastic music, and some really disturbing scenes. Basically the story is about a psychotic girl and her insane father who torture this guy. He wouldn't go out to prom with her, so she has her own fun with him. It is a very bloody movie and will for sure leave you shocked by the end of the movie. The Princess character is very creepy and does a good job at freaking you out. I highly recommend this one to any fan of Hostel or fans of gory slasher films.  I loved The Loved Ones! I give this one a 5/5 stars! Highly recommend it!"
1016,4.0,"I'M STILL HERE

STARRING: Joaquin Phoenix, Casey Affleck, Antony Langdon and Sean Combs

WRITTEN BY: Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck

DIRECTED BY: Casey Affleck

Rated: R
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 10 September 2010
Review Date: 26 November 2010

I'm Still Here was an interesting and entertaining film, but poses a somewhat difficult scenario when one sits down to write a review of it. Do you disclose it as the comedy that it is, or do you play along with the notion that it's a documentary so as not to ruin the surprise for the unsuspecting? I choose to reveal it as a comedy; don't ask me why - just do. Well - maybe I don't want folks to think Phoenix is a freaking whack-job. Because not knowing this film is in fact a `movie' rather than a documentary, would cause you to believe just that.

Joaquin Phoenix IS still here, folks, and he remains a very talented actor and could find himself nominated for his third Oscar, for his brilliant performance in a dramatized and very much comedic portrayal of himself.

When I read Roger Ebert's review I was as puzzled, as I imagine he was when watching the film; because it wasn't obvious at first if he was leading the readers on by claiming the film was real, or if he did in fact buy into it. I had the luxury of already being keen to the fact that it was all a `hoax', where as Ebert took the film as real as could be. He writes, ""If this film turns out to still be part of an elaborate hoax, I'm going to be seriously pissed.""

Well, sorry to disappoint you, Ebe. Ebert offers no explanation as to why he would be `seriously pissed' and I can only guess that it's because he made it so clear in his review, that the film was real - that to discover it was not, would prove him wrong. He too gave the film a favorable review, but he must have left in a hurry and not waited around to see the immediate credit that said: written and produced by Joaquin Phoenix and Casey Affleck.  I'm not knocking on the guy, I love his work; I just find some mild amusement in the situation.

I'm Still Here shows us Joaquin Phoenix and the supposed life he lives. Drugs, hookers, depression, a stench-induced lack of self confidence matched evenly with a case of bad hygiene. No longer finding any personal gratification in his talented craft of acting, Phoenix has decided to throw in the towel in an effort to become a rap star.

I liked the film, but it lacked in a few areas, the biggest being an understanding of why he wanted to be a rapper. But then again, I suppose that's the appeal to the character version of himself that he is playing. It's explained why he is done with acting - but even Phoenix doesn't quite seem to know why he wants to rap.

In actuality, there are a lot of things he seems to be unsure of in his life, and this is where a majority of the laughs come from. I'm very curious to know how much of the dialogue was scripted, because it's very good and flawlessly presented to us through the acting. I imagine a great deal of it was improvised. My favorite line that Phoenix delivers is, ""I'd like a f***ing joint... and to be anywhere other than Washington f***ing DC... but life is not a CHRISTMAS, day.""

Some of it had to be improvised, as we see Phoenix on David Letterman, and talking with other celebrities ranging from Ben Stiller and Bruce Willis to Jack Nicholson and Mos Def; all of whom are not in on the film. They think the Phoenix they are talking to is the real deal.

And thus my hat is off to Mr. Phoenix. Much like Sacha Baron Cohen in last year's hilarious Bruno, Phoenix only had one shot to nail his performance when in a scene with these celebrities, if the film was going to work. If he cracked up or broke character, the entire film could have been tarnished.

He also doesn't have a colorful character like Bruno or Borat to hide behind; he's putting HIMSELF out there, and it is truly amazing to see how dedicated he was to the project when you look at the grand scheme of it all. He carried on this persona for at the very least, several months on end and the press ate it up, indulging in the opportunity to make a laughing stock of him.

Some of the most entertaining scenes in the film that also display his improvisational skills the best, are when he meets with Sean Combs in an effort to have an album produced. Like the other celebrities in the film, Combs is not aware that Phoenix is acting. He sees the cameras, yes, but is told only that Phoenix is doing a documentary on his life. These scenes are gold, and are among the best in the film. Combs is a very unique individual, and Phoenix plays his weirdness at full volume around him, and we are rolling.

It's not blindingly clear to me why Casey Affleck and Joaquin Phoenix decided to make this film, nor what the point of it really is, other than to be entertaining and make people laugh now that it's all out in the open and exposed as a joke. But maybe it's just as simple as that, and if so - great. If not, then who cares? That mentality seems to hang in the air of the film anyways, now that I think about it.

If you are concerned that Phoenix won't be acting anymore, you can relax. You need only to watch a six minute special feature on the DVD or Blu-Ray to hear from his own lips that he enjoyed doing this movie, and loves acting very much, and will always act.

I'm eager to see what he does next and I'd also like to mention that I think perhaps Phoenix is playing a grown up version of that troubled young man we saw him play in Ron Howard's classic, Parenthood. As a fan and a human being, I hope that's somewhat the case, and that in his real life, he's not into drugs and hookers."
1017,3.0,"i never thought cd was anything too look at but then again, i'm a female. one thing i do think she excels at is comedic acting. she is freaking hi-larious in this film. justin timberlake is just as good in his role. the casting was spot on for every character.

the overall message however is extremely immoral which made it fall flat in the end. this woman does all sorts of really mean and crappy things (albeit funny) but is never called on it. ever. the annoying but innocent coworker gets the shaft. i ended up feeling sorry for her.

not a good message for the young folks."
1018,1.0,"Not good as a horror film, not good as a story, not good as a theatrical music piece.

A well polished turd.

I will compliment this movie on the musical score it was very nice.
I will also compliment on the adaptation of Swan lake that was also nice.

However... the story couldn't be more awful. A girl with an over obsessive mother becomes a black swan once she releases her sexual frustration? How raunchy can you get? This isn't even a movie about a love story. It's like someone had an idea for a skimpy movie about a good girl gone bad and tried to sugar coat it by dipping it into the theatrical arts. What you get are the good pieces of the adaption of swan lake and the bad pieces the story of this freaking movie. The end result is this crap. Potential to turn this movie into something great was very high. Too bad they missed every step on this one.

and no I'm not upset I watched this thinking it was a horror movie...

I'm upset because I watched this and got a movie that didn't have a good story.
This coming from a guy that usually likes these awkward types of movies (see my other reviews). I can't stand ""raunchy"" films like this where they expect you to take it seriously. It's not even tasteful and it disgraces the beauty of performance.

I can sum this movie up in one sentence:

""You want to be a good dancer? Have sex with either men,women,or yourself""
Because that's all this movie is about."
1019,5.0,"I just watched A Serbian Film. I can't recommend everyone see it - it is hard to watch, sick and twisted, and as absolutely brilliant as  Gaspar No's Irreversible.

This movie (covered in previous reviews) has a story, and a damned good one - I expected to see a flick that was one gross-out after another, and while there are some truly horrific scenes, the story is constructed beautifully and does a great job of showing how the main character falls so far.

In an odd way it reminded me of Boogie Nights - a movie that deals with adult subject matter in an adult way, starts out almost light-hearted, and then takes a dark turn. Of course the dark turns in this movie are very dark indeed.

I'm amazed how many prudes flipped out over the graphic nature of this film when all the sex is simulated. There are 'art house' films that have gotten rave reviews and have actual hardcore scenes and not much story beyond the sex. And as for those who complained about the film's sexualization of children, have any of those people watched any music videos by young female performers lately? Turning young teens into harlots is a booming cash business.

People will watch said art house movies and enjoy them. People will watch movies like Saw and enjoy them. For some reason people get upset when you mix the two together. Let's face it, most of the violent scenes in this film are cartoonishly over the top, and any scenes involving children are implied or faked. Brook Shields appeared nude in Pretty Baby when she was 12 freaking years old and the critics LOVED it. Nothing like that is seen in A Serbian Film.

As for this movie presenting sickening scenes, as I said, it is all fake, it's a MOVIE. The REAL thing is happening every day in every town, all you have to do is turn on the news to see that. You want to complain about something, how about fixing the foster care system where real horrors happen all the time?

The climactic castration scene from Hostel 2 is available for everyone, including children, to view on Youtube. It is THE most realistically graphic violent scene I've ever seen in a movie, and it is on Youtube, uncensored. Where is the outrage over THAT? In fact, the violent scenes in the Hostel flicks are far more grotesque than anything seen in A Serbian Film. Yet people rage against this movie that has a great story, wrenching scenes, a fantastic cast, and brilliant cinematography, and it's a film structured so pictures tell most of the tale and the subtitles are unobtrusive.

If you can handle a trip into the extremely dark side of human nature, you might be surprised by how good this film is."
1020,5.0,"I had been hesitant about watching Baccano for a long time, because I had heard that--while it was, to quote Dallas ""freaking unbelievable!""--it was a very gory affair. Which it is. To be honest, I am incredibly squeamish about gore of any kind, even someone getting beat up in a fist fight without any blood. But the other elements of Baccano-the characters, the story, the animation, the wonderful dub, the music, the fact that whoever wrote this did actual research into the period in which they placed their story--everything is just so excellent and so fun that I watched the whole series in two days and bought it the next day. It's that good. I've only ever bought one anime before--Kino's Journey--because I have no money and have to be extremely choosy with what I do buy, so that fact that I bought it, gore notwithstanding, on the minimal budget I have, says a lot. Baccano's a perfectly fun roller coaster ride from beginning to end, and not to be missed by anyone. Even if you don't like gore. Just do what I did, and flinch and cover your eyes. It's worth it. Trust me."
1021,5.0,Funniest freaking show since Seinfeld!!
1022,3.0,"Resident Evil's fourth 3-D installment had its work cut out for it: Alice was now an army of clones hell-bent on digging Wesker, leader of the Umbrella Corporation, out of his hole and squashing him like a bug. Wesker was replaced by a more physical actor, which is a good sign - fans of the series know just how tough he really is.

Where the third installment killed off characters in a desperate bid to save the few remaining survivors, this movie is about Alice (Mila Jovovavich) and Claire Redfield (Ali Larter).  After neatly offing the clones, removing her superpowers, and uprooting Wesker, Afterlife switches gears to Alice's lonely search for other human beings.

Mila looks rounder, sexier, more full in this film than she has in all of the other Resident Evil movies put together  Her crystal gaze is as lovely and piercing as ever, and the movie wisely exchanges Alice's thigh-high dominatrix outfit for something more practical. Motherhood suits her.

Claire, on the other hand, starts out suitably mussed and becomes inexplicably more and more glam with every camera shot. She has no other purpose than to be the eye candy got when Alice is unconscious, which isn't very often.

Things pick up when Alice crash lands her plane onto a prison surrounded by zombies.  Paul W. S. Anderson has an eye for interesting shots, and he finds beauty in the grotesque, from a burnt-out Hollywood to the bloody zombie smear left by a low-flying plane. We end with a few new survivor stereotypes who do not disappoint - the sleazy agent, the hopeful actress, the noble sports hero, the miscellaneous guy with an accent, the nerdy guy prone to freaking out.  Most will die - except for the ones we can recognize from the game, in which case they'll stick around to the end.

All the survivors seek Arcadia, a safe haven free from the zombie infection. Arcadia is not what it seems, of course, and then we're back to CGI zombies with tentacles for mouths, dogs that split in half, and really big guys with axes.  None of this is explained and for fans of the series, they don't need to be. We've seen them all in Resident Evil 5.

What's surprising is how the fourth installment is so uninterested in continuity with its own movie canon and focused on staying true to the video game series. Fans of the game will applaud seeing their favorite monsters on the silver screen - everyone else will probably be confused.

All the interesting elements that made the third installment so unique have been jettisoned in favor of tentacles, standard survivor tropes, and big, bad Wesker. Resident Evil Afterlife isn't a bad movie.  It's just not as good as its predecessor."
1023,1.0,"Now I like the RE series. So much so that I've played the games and watched the movies multiple times. So I decided to go to the midnight premier of the newest installment in the RE franchise. Upon entering the theater I was met by ecstatic fans. So naturally my excitement rose. About forty minutes later the lights dimmed and we held our breath as the movie began. What we were treated to was unfortunately the worst RE yet. The story picks up right where the third one left off.

*Spoilers* After Alice and her clones take their revenge on the Umbrella facility in Tokyo, Alice makes her way to the fabled sanctuary known as Arcadia. Upon arriving at the supposed location of this safe haven, she discovers Claire Redfield, of course burdened with the classic cliche: amnesia. So she has no way of remembering what happened to the rest of the party that Alice had sent there in RE Extinction. Fearing that they are the last humans, they make their way to Los Angeles. Because that's exactly where you should go during a zombie apocalypse, a LARGE CITY! In LA they find a whole horde of zombies. SHOCKING! There also happens to be a small band of survivors surviving in a prison. Again, SHOCKING! Alice MUST help these people get to Arcadia. Why? Who knows?! Or cares?! The farther along the movie went, the more I realized that I was not one of the few people who did. The movie was nothing more than action sequences tethered together by nothingness. Most of the new characters were completely worthless and only served as fodder for the zombie hordes. Now I know the RE series is not looking for an Oscar but really, a little more effort from the actors and the screenwriters to develop the characters might have made me care a little more. Actually I doubt it. These characters have gotten boring! The action scenes were half decent but even those were ruined. The huge killer? SLOW-MOTION! I wanted to rip my hair out! A great action scene is instantly killed with unnecessary 2min slow-motion. Alice jumps off a building -> slow-motion. Someone throws a gun to Alice -> slow-motion. Claire takes out a zombie boss -> slow-motion. Alice picks her nose -> slow-motion! Totally killed the pacing and excitement. Another major pace killer? The editing! The movie is absolutely filled with useless shots. For instance: more often than not we'll get a birds eye view of the area and Alice's location. Yes, we get it, she's being tracked! A little gripe out of the many shots, but little things like that really accumulate.

Now Afterlife did have a few shining moments. The 3D was actually spectacular! It really helped with the depth of the movie, particularly with the flying scenes and the zombie battles. Was it a gimmick? A big emphatic HELL YES! Everything from knives, bullets, blood, guns, zombies, and giant axes were thrown at the viewer. While it was a bit much at times, it was still awesome! Apart from the 3D, seeing The Executioner made me as giddy as a school girl. He was freaking amazing. Unfortunately, he and the ""new"" zombies are never explained in the movies, which only leads to confusion. While the end of RE Afterlife leaves room for a sequel, ""this"" RE universe in no way deserves another one. The best way to continue the RE movies is IMO by completely rebooting it. Make a Resident Evil movie based on the actual games! Resident Evil Afterlife wasn't just disappointing. No, it was a terrible movie with a predictable plot, stagnant pacing and dull characters."
1024,3.0,"When my kids and I first saw that there was a new ""Scooby Doo"" series, we were thrilled-- we're big Scooby fans at this house. And, when we saw that Shaggy and Velma were having a clandestine romance, I thought, ""Oh, how CUTE-- about time!"" And, the Daphne/Freddie thing... also good, because they belong together, too. However... I became disenchanted halfway through the first season, because I became mildly uncomfortable watching it with my kids. The story was too dramatic and soap-opera-y, and the characters were just wrong. Scooby would not have been jealous over Shaggy and Velma dating-- he'd've been happy for them! Velma and Shaggy dating was okay, except it was too much drama, and Velma turned into a crazy stalker. Daphne, by comparison, may have loved Fred, but she wasn't all suicidally obsessed with him like she was freaking Bella Swan, and Fred wasn't a complete freaking idiot. Just... no, no, no..."

This is a nice twist on the heist genre with a couple of bumbling idiots who wouldn't be able to steal a stick of bubble gum much less steal money getting all together to make a truly funny experience.

Plot:
Ben plays Josh Kovacks who is head of the tower where he works. He finds out the boss he used to have respect for Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is actually a crook who has stolen not only his money but all the employees money in the whole building. We're talking wages, life savings, what have you. Shaw is already under investigation by the Feds, so he has nothing to lose and could care less if he's brought a lot of suffering to people he swindled ala Bernie Madoff.

Josh vows to get revenge assembling all of the people with an axe to grind on Shaw and planning an elaborate heist. Trouble is no one has a freaking clue how to pull it off.

Josh enlists a crook named Slide (Eddie Murphy) to bring his expertise to lead the plan.

This movie is very funny. Obviously all of the big names here are all comedy veterans: Stiller is a joke a minute, Broderick has always been good in whatever role he's been given, Michael Pena is a good and up coming actor,but probably the biggest surprise here has to be Eddie Murphy.

Eddie is a comedy veteran to be sure, but he has been in a A LOT of bad, bad movies, so this was a nice change from all that. In fact I got a ""Trading Places"" vibe here when he gets recruited by Josh to be part of the team.

There are a lot of funny scenes in this movie that everybody will have a favorite one. I personally like the ""mall scene"" early in the movie when Slide enlists the guys to rob things from the mall to show if they really have it in them to steal something.

All in all this is definitely worth not just a viewing but multiple viewings at the theater."
1028,5.0,IT's all good. OMG - I can't buy something without having to write 30 freaking words??? leave me alone already.  Can't I just buy in peace?????
1029,3.0,"I just watched this on Syfy and you know its not such a bad movie. It wasn't the best but it was definitely one of the better movies nowadays that I have watched.

I thought the acting for this movie was good. The main girls crying was a bit annoying but you know she was trying to show emotion which I can slide by. But, the last guy to die was such a pussy through the whole movie, he just let his gf Mel (who had changed) and Dace (the tough guy who also changed) drag one of them like a freaking sacrifice or something. But yet than all of a sudden got balls when he found Dace behind his girl, he freaked out and went after Dace. Its not like they were getting it on! But I was like Really? You choose now to man up and fight? You deserve to have gotten your neck bit off and die doofus!

The effects were alright they were average.

The Plot summary from IMDB: A group of friends travel into the Australian wilds to view ancient cave paintings but soon find a horrible sickness gripping one of their own, which leaves them with nothing in their mind but a primal blood lust.

People have been saying there is a lot of gaps in this movie and for the most part I disagree. I feel like its more of a tighter and well kept story through the whole thing than a lot of other movies. Yes there is things in the movie that you don't know about which makes you go well what about this? or what really is this going on here? But I think it was done to leave a bit of an imagination and let you ponder it. Like a lot of people didn't like the movie The Ruins but I actually enjoyed cuz it was a straight forward film but it left some imagination to it like the why's and what now and how did this get started.  Just like this one does.
Like, you don't exactly know why the girl blackouts at first except for hearing that she was in the basement for a week. You don't know why the ground like sucked in the blood and than the water started bubbling or something. You don't know why or how this all got started. You don't know if that was a huge ass leech in the end or how this girl ended up with a huge belly that had a thing inside her. Those are a few examples but those are the stuff that makes you think and lets your imagination do the talking and I think a lot more things need to do that. And if you are the type of person that wants every single answer straight forward in a movie than this one will just piss you off. and if you like to think a bit and ponder the what if's in life and think what if there really is a unknown place we have in our world that has something like this than this be a movie for you to watch.

I can almost guarantee that this wouldnt' be one of your favorite movies and it be a movie that you were be like well that was a good movie but i don't think i would watch it again. But i don't think it was horrible. And if you did think it was, than you did but there really has been worse and this one isn't one. its an average in the middle one!"
1030,5.0,I thought for a while about what to rate this movie. I finally decided on 5 stars. It was a psychological thriller and it did a good job of freaking me out. It does start off kind of slow and sort of lures you in. You think this movie is going to be boring and slow. Then it hits you with the action. This movie creeped me out and I've seen ever Saw movie there is. While they are certainly more graphic they aren't as creepy and freaky as this movie. Watch it with the lights on for sure. :)
1031,5.0,"This is an amazing movie. If you took parts of Itchy & Scratchy, GTA San Andreas, Blaxploitation movies of the 70s, and bad porn, and then had it stirred up, dipped in batter, and deep fried by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's unholy spawn, you get this stupidly perfect movie.

Some of the scenes in this insane grindhouse fest will have you pause, rewind, re-watch, and repeat: they are that freaking over-the-top. There were at least a half dozen literal jaw-dropping, eye-bulging, WOW moments. I wish I could share some of the great moments but they have to be witnessed in stunned amazement as I did, without any preparation.

Now let's get this straight; this movie has almost no genuine redeeming cinematic qualities. The plot is ridiculous, the script inane, there is no semblance of reality, and there is a moronically heavy handed pro-illegal immigrant message.  However, there is a reason this movie boasts big names and I'm pretty sure it wasn't for the paycheck or the chance to get an Oscar. It's because this is pure artery-clogging joy. If you feel the need to critique this movie you probably also look for the sanitary qualities of a truck taco. I don't know about you, but some of the best food I've ever eaten came from a truck. I can't sum it up any better than that."
1032,4.0,"I loved the first in the series, but this one was just alright. It's hard to say if this one is better or worse than the second, I'd say about the same. Story and acting is alright, but the effects I will admit are freaking awesome. Great detail to them, and lots of great scenes as far as the effects go, that's for sure."

Transformers: Dark Of The Moon is a massive overload of action. By now, at the third entry in the series, you should know how you feel about Michael Bay's Transformers series, and Michael Bay movies in general. If you love dumb action,  hot girls, and the best CGI that mankind has to offer, then you will love this movie. If you hated the last two, this one definitely won't change your mind.

The setup for the film can be summarized pretty quickly: the film recounts the War for Cybertron (pretty neat) and explains that there was an ulterior motive behind the space race of the 60's. There's even a CGI JFK, which lasted about 3 seconds but still was kinda cool. Flash-forward to present day, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is having a hard time finding a job after college (there are some funny scenes with Sam on interviews). Elsewhere, Lt. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and the NEST team of Autobots are taking out the fledgling Decepticons. The bad guys rise up and invade Chicago, planning to take over Earth. Obviously Optimus Prime is pissed.

The battles in this movie are better directed and easier to follow than in Transformers or Revenge of the Fallen.  They can still get pretty hectic, but in general I could tell who was fighting who more often than not. The fights were also visually more interesting, with great choreography and CGI. I still can't get over, after three movies, how freaking real the robots look standing right next to the human characters. ILM did a fantastic job once again.

The movie is a tiny bit darker, but Bay exaggerated a bit about it. The Decepticons have some cool parts where they get to show how evil they are, such as a sequence when they kill off some of their human allies. I was surprised when they actually showed large groups of humans being exploded into nothing by Decepticons. Also, there is quite a bit of bad language in the movie. I felt a little weird being surrounded by kids and babies, and seeing gratuitous ass shots and violence and hearing much more expletives than in the previous films. I could care less, but parents should know that it does push its PG-13 rating a bit far.

Most of the old cast returns, like the previously mentioned Shia  and Josh, along with Tyrese Gibson's Epps, and the always funny Agent Simmons, played by John Turturro. There are a good amount of newcomers this time around. John Malkovich is one of Sam's eccentric bosses. Ken Jeong is one of his co-workers, who was funny at first but they played his part out far too quicly, and he became annoying. The same could be said of Alan Tudyk (Steve The Pirate!) in some weird gay German sidekick shtick to Simmons. Kevin Dunn and Julie White are back as Sam's sometimes funny, sometimes grating parents. Here they are mostly grating. Frances McDormand plays National Intelligence Director Mearing. Patrick Dempsey makes a heel turn as a too-nice-to-be-true boss, who quickly shows his evil side. As you can see, there are a lot of characters stuffed into this mammoth, 2.5 hour movie.

The characters you will see the most of are of course Sam, the awesome robots and Megan Fox's replacement, model-turned-actress (Slashie Award!) Rosie-Huntington-Whitely. She is OK for a first time-actress, but to be honest her sugar sweet attitude gets annoying by the end, and dare I say it, I missed Megan Fox a bit. I'm sure water cooler debate will wage for some time to come over who was hotter, and I'd have to give the edge to Megan. Also, even though there are giant robots doing battle on the streets of Chicago in this movie, the least believable thing has to be that Sam's character can continue to get these supermodel girls.

Now for the robots. Optimus Prime is as badass as he's ever been, with awesome battles worthy of him. He also gets to use his cool sword more in this movie, and even takes a giant robo-shotgun to another bots face. Megatron is back in a smaller role than usual, with a cool hoodie/cloak type thing and a badly destroyed body from the ROTF end battle. Starscream and Shockwave are sweet. Some of those tiny, goofy, comedy relief robots are back and annoying as usual. There are some more dumb looking Autobots this time, like an Autobot that looks like an old man, with gray hair and everything. Since when do robots grow old or have hair? It's really dumb, unnecessary, and when he dies a horrible death (not a spoiler, nobody cares about him) most of the audience laughed. Those two racist robots from ROTF are gone, thank God. Finally, Leonard Nimoy voices a robot called Sentinel Prime.

After the travesty that was Revenge of the Fallen, Michael Bay and company try to redeem themselves a bit with Dark of the Moon. They aren't completely successful, as the movie still falls into many of the traps the last two did, but it is the most fun Transformers movie since the first film. The movie is definitely too long, has too many goofy slapstick bits, and too many characters. But if you're willing to go in with an open mind (and switched-off brain) you will have fun."
1034,5.0,"Like many who were fortunate enough to see the the fantastic Swedish film, 'Let the Right One In' I was a little more than annoyed at Hollywood for allowing only a scant two years to pass before attempting to remake this film. If they were going to remake this film, they should have let at little more time pass by, especially since they were going to remake a film that was considered by fans and critics to be a masterpiece, and possibly one of the greatest horror films that has ever been made. Couldn't they have waited  another 5, maybe 10 years so that the original could actually settle in and take its place in the pantheon of horror movie classics. No. Hollywood, in its incessant drive to horde as much money as possible, decided to commit sacrilege and go ahead with its' remake anyway.

However as the premiere for the movie approached, and the glowing reviews began to stream in, I was intrigued.  Was it possible for 'Let Me In' to be in the same class as 'Let the Right One In?'  Is the child actress from 'Kick Ass' really that great, and is the kid from 'The Road' really that affecting as Owen, the boy who is brutally bullied without impunity by his three tormentors.  After seeing the film, I grudgingly have to say yes.

'Let Me In' is just as good a movie as 'Let the Right One In'. 'Let Me In' is very faithful to the original in many ways, but the new director, Matt Reeves, does inject some of his own vision into his adaptation of the brilliant book that this movie is based on. First, the violence and emotion in 'Let Me In' is a lot more visceral and aggressive than it was in the original film. Matt Reeves films most of his movie through closeups, and when a violent act is committed or a person is suffering emotionally, the film goer is impacted more forcefully. Chloe Moretz's(Hitgirl from Kickass) character in the film embodies this films aggression. She is the vampire who charms people with her 12 year old facade, but when she is hungry for blood, she morphs into a crazed killing machine. Abby kills without reservation because it is in her nature to do so. And when she kills in this film she freaking kills.  She rips skin, she breaks bones, and emits a banshee like wail while doing the deed. There are more scenes in this film that illustrate this movie's more aggressive take on the source material than the original film, and this may offend some people. But the aggressive nature of this film appealed to a different side of my sensibility.

The great thing about both of these movies is the focus on the relationship that develops between two very lonely people. Abby, the vampire, is a 250 year old being who is trapped inside the body of a 12 year old girl.  Owen, as I've stated above, is a 12 year boy who is mercilessly bullied at school, ignored by his mother, and is emotionally disconnected from his father. Abby and Owen suffer through an oppressive loneliness because of their respective situations.  When they find each other on a cold night in a desolate town in New Mexico, a relationship between the two principles ensues.  However, at the beginning, Abby enters into the relationship with caution, while Owen, who is so desperate for companionship, is frustrated by Abby's reluctance. Abby even warns Owen that they can't be friends at their relationship's inception. But after a while, Abby becomes intrigued by and then eventually begins to care for Owen and Owen for Abby. Abby and Owen develop an unbreakable bond, much to the dismay of Abby's ""father"" and they are soon bound to protect each other from harm. They provide a much needed companionship for each other, and they will protect their relationship at any cost, even if the continuation of their relationship calls for the sacrifice of the people who are in their lives. But when you're dealing with two lonely and suffering twelve year old kids, could you expect anything different?

The acting is great from all of the principle actors. Richard Jenkins and Elias Coteas each shine in their roles as the ""father"" and the cop who investigate the ""ritual"" murders taking place in the small town.  But it is the two kids who create an indelible impact in the viewers mind. Chloe Moretz and Kodi Smith McPhee are both twelve years old, but their acting is so beyond their respective ages. Kodi Smith McPhee is amazing as Owen.  His performance invites sympathy for his plight, but he also provides us with a glimpse of his character's potential as a future sociopath when he indulges in his fantasies of killing people, and creepily spies on the neighbors in his apartment complex.  Chloe Moretz is equally effective as Abby, projecting sadness, innocence, world weariness, and craftiness through her characterization of Abby. Even the bullies who torment Owen are great, especially the leader who injects his character with a muscular brutality that his counterpart in the original film did not have. In the book, the main bully is written as someone who is quite capable of murder, and the boy who plays him in this film really gives you that impression.

So give this movie a chance.  I promise that you won't regret it. It is so much better than the horror movies that the American public has to sit through now a days. This movie doesn't focus on devising creative ways for one person to inflict violence on another person(Saw and Hostel) as a means to create horror. ""Let Me In"" performs a study of horror based upon dysfunctional relationships, and the psychological damage that these relationships can inflict.  The violence that takes place in the film is a necessary counterpart to the story, and a necessity for the main character, not a means for amusement. So when Abby does kill, you're not tempted to roll your eyes and groan because of absurdity. And it is not just Abby, every character in this film does what they do out of necessity, not gratuity.

Oh, and read the book that both films are based on.  You will be thoroughly affected by the book.  I guarantee it."

1036,1.0,"This movie was such a freaking let down from the beginning scene all the way to the very last scene, the storyline blew balls, the acting was extremely bad, and the kills were so freaking laughable that I began asking myself is this a horror movie or a comedy???  All and all Hatchet 2 really sucked big time, I couldn't wait for it to be over when I watched it on Halloween with my wife that's how God awful it is, to sum it all up Hatchet 1 was super awesome, Hatchet 2 was super stupid!"
1037,5.0,"What can I say, it's freaking CONAN!"
1038,1.0,"Let it be known here and now that my experience with Conan the Barbarian when I watched this movie was perhaps a few stills from the old movie and a paragraph from Temple of the Elephant. So I thought I would watch it, having a mostly fresh brain for it, and hardly any expectation. I mean, I've watched some movies before that were almost universally panned and they turned out not to be maybe not favorites, but at least good. Also, I tend to like gritty movies, and I haven't seen enough fantasy movies to truly grasp the extent to which the film industry utterly and completely fails with regards to fantasy.
This movie blows.
I'd like to say it was okay up 'til the point where Young Conan kills the scouts and spits out the unbroken egg to show that he's manly enough to fight with the warriors, but really, it's kind of crap before then when he's ""born of battle"" and we get to see a crappy CGI baby. Seriously, I have seen more natural-looking newborns in youtube comedy shorts!
Conan himself, well, he's a freaking jerk; I have no sympathy for him, and the only reason I am glad he won is because the bad guys are slightly worse. And that psychotic bald chick; eugh *shudder*. Over-the-top villains are something I expect to see in a kids' movie; the witch-girl is so hilariously awful that I never want to watch another movie with her in it ever again; and I kind of liked Planet Terror! Now it's ruined for me!
Even the good things about this movie are awful. The love interest, Foxyface, is completely useless! The only reason she's there is because the bad guys need her blood and Conan apparently needs her virginity, because sex is what fuels dumb barbarians.
Speaking of which, what's with the crappy sex scenes in movies? Does it add to the plot in any way, shape or form to have ten seconds of Foxyface and Conan humping out in the caves? Even laying aside that it could easily have been tastefully implied that they were having sexytimes, Conan is such a colossal idiot and jerk that they pretty much have to, or else he'd never know she was kidnapped. Also, it's somewhat ironic that the topless slave girls they free near the beginning of the movie are pretty much doing the same thing they were doing as slaves after they've been freed, only it's for Conan and his black friend instead of slavers, so that's okay.
Some thoughts on storyline: Mr. McEvildude goes and murders Conan's papa, stealing the last piece of the tentacle mask in doing so. Then he laughs evilly, swishes his cape and disappears for several years, just long enough for Conan to grow up, get some fighting experience and hunt him down. Why didn't he just go after the blood of Foxyface right after killing Conan's pa? If you're arguing she's not old enough, I say that's pretty much bull pucky; the original ritual used the blood of these kings' virgin daughters, and, well, foxyface obviously ain't a virgin when she's going to be used, so those rules seem pretty flexible. What was he doing for all those years? Searching? He's got his ugly daughter to help with that, and besides; when they head for the place, it's pretty obviously where they need to go; McEvildude's wife was murdered there, so...
Of all the movies I have watched, this is one of them.
I wish it wasn't.
I wish I had skipped the movie and read the books; I've started them and, so far, Howard's Conan is much more interesting than this one. Not a total idiot, not a total douche, though definitely a bit of a jerk. And a rapist, really; I mean, he chased down the Frost God's daughter and tried getting sexy with her (to be fair, she was taunting him, naked in the snow, but still). There are faults with the Real Conan, but I definitely prefer him and his broader character than Knockoff Douchebag Conan."
1039,5.0,I don't watch scary movies but I do enjoy space movies....they are the kind of spook I can handle without freaking out at night. I enjoyed this one on the edge of my seat. It's spooky. Makes me wanna know more. I thought it was pretty good considering the premise.
1040,5.0,"i gont get why there are so many bad reviews, i freaking loved this film...but then again i have always been the type to like what others didnt... but none the less...it had great action and i think that amber heard did a great job in this film...im so glad that its out so that i can own it"
1041,2.0,"I read the original Conan series after seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger muscling it up as the titular beefcake hero in multiple films. To my delight Conan was much more verbal and a lot less muscle-bound in Robert E. Howard's fiction. I can only assume that's what the producers were striving for when they decided to remake ""Conan the Barbarian.""

In so many ways, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is similar to ""Immortals"": nave but violent young man (Leo Howard as young Conan) witnesses a parents' death (Ron Perlman as Corin), swears to avenge himself on the megalomaniac (Stephen Lang as Khalar Zym) responsible, stumbles across a beautiful yet chaste priestess (Rachenl Nichols as Tamara) who just happens to be the Chosen One that the megalomaniac is hunting, the villain manages to capture an artifact without her help anyway, and then in a final climactic battle the hero duels the madman over some precipice. If that's all there was to ""Conan the Barbarian"" it would be a passable if unremarkable film. But this is Conan the freaking Barbarian we're talking about, so that's not good enough.

Things aren't helped by the fact that adult Conan doesn't appear on screen for the first 15 minutes; that Conan has no character development whatsoever (he's more interesting as a child than a man); that most violence seems to be less about slashing and instead clubbing people with swords so that special effects blood appear at random; and cliffs and forest terrain appear completely out of nowhere.

""Conan"" does get a few things right. Topless women abound. There's definitely a Lovecraftian feel to the Dweller, but after seeing the villain's men marching in uniform black armor accompanying a ship carried by elephants, it's hard not to make parallels to ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. Because Conan never manages to really create a sense of place, it just seems like it ripped off other, better fantasy films.

And that's a shame. Jason Momoa does a good job of making Conan more than muscles, although he has those in spades too. His spunky sidekick Tamara stands out in sharp contrast to the other Hyborean women, but she never does anything noteworthy enough to matter. Tamara's the same helpless princess in all the Conan stories, only now she juts out her lip and claims she's ""no man's property."" Of all the characters, the only one of interest is Rose McGowan's Marique, managing to create a sexy/creepy villainess with incestuous undertones. SPOILER THE BARBARIAN: Marique uses her magic on a special effect that seems wasted (sand dwellers aren't the archetypical Conan monster I would have picked) and she suffers an ignominious death that's not worthy of the character, but that's note McGowan's fault.

In the end, ""Conan the Barbarian"" bears little resemblance to the books that inspired it. Although this version exhibits more brains the brawn, it's not enough. In an era where there are dozens of imitators spawned by the original film, ""Conan the Barbarian"" is muscled out by the competition."
1042,5.0,"""And finally this question, the mystery of whose story it will be. Of who draws the curtain. Who is it that chooses our steps in the dance? Who drives us mad? Lashes us with whips and crowns us with victory when we survive the impossible? Who is it, that does all of these things?""

I love Zack Snyder because he always produces dazzling eye candy in his films. Caravaggio styling from classical art, marrying present day cinema, giving birth to an epic narrative to produce a family of beautiful warriors.

Sucker punch is gorgeous cinematography and I'm Zack Snyder's bi-atch.

This film is a girlpowa action adventure that most feminists will deeply hate. I mean what is empowering about crazy girls/strippers trying to escape the reality of their cruel repressed lives through surreal imagination? Well it could be that its allowing them to fight their demons and reach one another in a commonality that sets their souls free. I read an incredible quote just before watching this movie that says that feminism isn't fighting against the ideals of a patriarchal society, it's fighting for women to know that they have a choices in everyone's society. So before someone starts waving their subjugation flag realize that this is an incredible movie for saying that the fight for many marginalized people is real and not to play dead for anyone. And fighting is making a choice when you have none.

/end of my politico soapbox speech.

Emily Browning is freaking gorgeous and I always watch Lemony Snicket after this to see where she has come from. The choreography for the fighting is spectacular; Emily and is lithe as all get out. Jena Malone is as kick butt in Sucker Punch as she is in Hunger Games--although I like her playing insane tribute more so than the idealistic younger sister in this movie. I often wonder if Donnie Darko approves of how Ms. Malone has had her come-up in Hollywood. She seems to play a whole lot of deranged peeps.

My favorite is Oscar Isaac in his scary portrayal of club owner Blue Jones. Some of the moments where he is menacing Dr. Gorski, Blondie and Sweet Pea are shockingly powerful in expression. His sinister aspect is almost palpable when he is in his victim's faces, chillingly so. Its all about the eyes and invasion of personal space--I think Oscar would make a frightening gangster boss--crazy eyes and all. Sucker Punch is where he flew onto my radar and he fascinates me still. Not to mention that spicy duet of Bryan Ferrys Love is the Drug with Carla Gugino on the soundtrack.

And if Zack Snyder's vision, Oscar Isaacs villainy, Steve Shibuya's screenwriting, and the soundtrack--which is beyond amazing, isn't enough than we have the icing on the cake. John Hamm steps in as the big roller/lobotomist making this movie killer. He has all of two minutes of screentime but hes like a good scotch and it doesnt take a lot to heat me up.

 Who honors those we love for the very life we live? Who sends monsters to kill us, and at the same time sings that we will never die? Who teaches us what's real and how to laugh at lies? Who decides why we live and what we'll die to defend? Who chains us? And who holds the key that can set us free... It's you. You have all the weapons you need. Now fight!"
1043,5.0,"I genuinely feel guilty -- honestly awful -- that I didn't hear about this show when it was on the air. Now, because of the low viewership when it was on air, it won't get it's final season. Long sigh. At least there is Season 2, which is equally as amazing, if not better. Sorry creators, for not catching on sooner. Anyway, it'is fan-freaking-tastic. 10 Stars."
1044,4.0,"It must be said that the ""found footage"" sub-genre of horror movies requires the audience to suspend disbelief a bit.  The idea is clever - you're watching something that allegedly really happened, which gives the movie a bit of documentary-style credibility.  But you have to accept that at some point in the movie, you're going to shout, ""put down the darn camera!""  It's surprising that the ""Scream"" franchise hasn't mocked this trope yet.

Either you can get past this, or you can't.  If you can, the ""Paranormal Activity"" series should be on your must-see list.  The first two movies tell the present-day stories of Kristi and Katie, two sisters whose pleasantly suburban lifestyles are ripped asunder by a sinister spectral force.  In ""Paranormal Activity 3,"" we return to 1988, where the sisters first meet the poltergeist who will terrify them and their families a few years down the road.

The movie sets the stage by showing grown-up Kristy and Katie rediscovering old videotapes from when they were children - a gift from recently departed Grandma.  These tapes are later stolen in a scene all too familiar with fans of the first two films.  The movie then switches to the videotapes.

Young Katie and Kristi are enjoying Katie's birthday party, and we also meet their mom Julie and her boyfriend Dennis.  (Oddly, there's never any mention of the girls' biological father - where did he go . . . hmmm.)  Dennis, conveniently for the movie's conceit, is a videographer, so naturally his response to every development is his life is to tape it.  During the birthday video, we learn that Kristi has a close relationship with an imaginary friend, Toby.

Toby, as you might guess, turns out to be more than imaginary, and he quickly proves to be one scary, demanding guy.  To avoid spoilers, that's it for the plot summary.

Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman know how to make a found-footage movie.  Tension builds nicely as we strain to watch a seemingly innocuous scene - are the bedsheets moving?  How about the lamp?  Perhaps the creepiest scenes (before the final 15 minutes, which are terrifying) come with their use of a video camera set up on an oscillating fan base so the camera slowly pans from one part of the house to another - the directors' clever use of the ""that freaking thing wasn't there a few seconds ago"" trick will have you looking over your own shoulder the next time you're all alone in the house and hear an unexplained noise.

For a third installment in a horror series, ""Paranormal Activity 3"" exceeds all expectations.  A spooky film that builds to a truly frightening third act, ""3"" succeeds in deepening the story created by the first two installments without wearing out our interest - the filmmakers know that we're here to get scared, not to get a PhD-level understanding of Toby . . . and scare you they do.  Terrific stuff."
1045,1.0,"This movie was AWFUL! I can't believe I just spent $4 and a couple hours of my life watching this. Whoever wrote this has some serious misconceptions about love, friendship, success. The plot was super predictable, and the characters were the absolute WORST. The only redeeming person in the whole movie was Ethan (Jon Krasinski), and ::SPOILER:: he didn't get a happy ending... Or maybe his happy ending was the fact that he got far far away from the rest of those horrible, selfish, adulturing, immature, unromantic characters.

So, tons of guys would be birdogging her and she wouldn't wait around for you ( a guy from out of town ) for any reason.  In the real world, hot women,like Mila Kunis are a commodity and highly sought after and usually already taken.  Also, in real life, men are the aggressors and women are more demure.  Men are like dogs and women are like cats....ie cats scare easy.  Men have to convince women to do things with them....get coffee or date.  In this movie, Justin t. has a don't give a $##$ attitude and is the one being pursued after by the hot girl.  Unrealistic....it's the other way around.  That's human nature.
  Justin Timberlake is so much more talented than John Mayer that he has seeming disdain for him in this movie:  UNREALISTIC - In reality John Mayer has more talent in one of his fingers than Justin T. has in his whole body.  John Mayer writes his own stuff....plays guitar like Jimmy freaking Hendrix and sings good.  Mayer's lyrics often have deep meaningful insights to life ( except for some of that obvious made for radio stuff....which I don't care for either )  Meanwhile what does TImberlake do?  Jump around on stage.....playing NO instrument....dressed in Shiny outfits and sing along to boy band songs.  Big freakin whup.  Mayer having disdain for Timberlake.....would make more sense.
  OK....there were some funny parts.....but the lack of what the real world is like in terms of human nature and the way women and men interact......blew it for me."
1048,5.0,"I don't understand why people don't like this movie at all either however that is their opinion, mine is I loved it!!! Went to see a movie not expecting a big deal and found myself still to this day freaking out on it I loved it that much. The ending folks if you were not paying attention watch the credits... yep you heard me right, more to the ending with the credits so sit still and wait for it or if you now own it on dvd fast forward to it. I see a possible number two in the future, who knows. Just leave an open mind when watching I thought it was excellent and am waiting very impatiently for this dvd to be available. I thought this movie had great effects love the outfits well made and still reeling from seeing it in the theater. Enjoy the movie, I sure did!!!!!"
1049,4.0,"OK, so I will admit some major bias, I am a big fan of Green Lantern ever since the Death of Superman saga back in the early/mid 90s. So that being said, I have had some time to fall in and fall out of the GL fanboy status but still my heart pumps that crazy green glow no matter what. Hence, when I heard that this movie was coming out I was absurdly ecstatic about it (kind of like how I was when I heard about Transformers). And much like Transformers, I didn't go into this movie expecting much.

First of all, the movie had Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan. Ryan Reynolds as the care free, smartass Kyle Rayner maybe, but not as the serious and solemn Hal Jordan. Honestly, I could've seen Nathan Fillion in his younger days as Hal but really, the guy from 2 Guys and a Girl and a Pizza Place? And yet with my skepticism, he works. Despite what I would consider some major artistic license with this re-imagined version of the title character, Reynolds works his charm, comic timing, and overall sincerity to make this version of Hal Jordan very likable to the point that you might actually be reciting the oath with him (I did so under my breath at one point I think).

Folks gave this movie some major flak for some of the effects looking too cartoony. We all realize two things about this film right? One: this is a freaking comic book based movie for Christ's sake! Magic ring and spandex! Granted, the 100% CGI costume is a bit overboard in my humble opinion and did have some moments of cheese with it. However, this is a movie about a guy who gets a magic ring and meets aliens one of which is a human sized chipmunk! Two: we do realize who this character/actor is? One scene in particular that many critics and audience members disliked was the race track that GL used to divert the falling helicopter. The ring makes constructs from the user's will power and imagination. From the goofy and immature way that Hal Jordan is portrayed, who is really surprised by this? Yes it is cartoony to the point that it reminds me of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" but it is sort of the way they were going for. Once again, not exactly how Hal Jordan is in the comics but once again, re-imagining and artistic license.

The acting and writing. OK, that I will give in on. The writing sounded like it came straight from the comics and as eye candy(licious) as Blake Lively is, I wouldn't consider her the strongest actress out there. However, she and Reynolds do make an attractive couple and they do have decent chemistry with one another. Unfortunately, a lot of the other actors are relatively forgettable in this movie. And yes, there are some major plot holes in this film. The Guardians are beings from the beginning of time with infinite wisdom with one of them becoming the being known as Parallax and he somehow forgets about the gravitational pull deal? OK, fine I'll forget about that. Then Sinestro after witnessing Hal Jordan proving the power of the Green Lantern Ring does his thing at the end? Couldn't they have made this more of Lucifer thing with him becoming jealous or something instead of just a random act? Eh, what can you do?

For all its faults, Green Lantern is still entertaining with plenty of eye candy in either visual effects, Lively, or Reynolds. The acting and writing isn't the best but this is a comic book movie looking more for box office receipts instead of Oscar nods. Is it true to Green Lantern lore? No. Is it entertaining and a decent origin story to introduce the general populace to Green Lantern? Kinda. Is it worth a watch when you don't really want to tax the brain? Like many other action flicks, it definitely is. This is by no means on par with The Dark Knight but at least it is a few levels above Superman Returns. (Once again, my opinion not fact)"
1050,5.0,"If you are from generation X this movie will rock for you! This movie took me back to my childhood and really took me on a wonderful ride! Yes it has alien monsters, but it is still a freaking cool ""this is childhood"" effect. Check it out."
1051,5.0,"I have to admit, I've become a bit jaded when it comes to current legal drama films, but ""The Lincoln Lawyer"" was soooo freaking good. It's good to see Matt McC doing drama like this - I think he reminds the world that he isn't just another pretty face with this one. It reminds me of Primal Fear, with the protagonist being brought back down to the level of us humans, and Matt McC really delivers. The plot twists were great, and the cast was great. It's always great to see William H. Mac, Marisa Tomei and Francis Fisher onscreen. And the soundtrack... I know this is about a film, but the soundtrack is so perfect, it really does push the film further than just a good film. Kudos to the actors and filmmakers for this film - I needed it after watching a bunch of junk called suspenseful drama."
1052,5.0,"I freaking love this movie...funny, pervy, and just a great group of actors.  I ended up buying like three copies to give people for Christmas...this movie changed my life."

1054,3.0,"Okay, Heart fans are blessed by a proliferation of concert DVDs over the last decade or so.  Another one is always welcome!  One minor complaint about content is that the setlists don't vary too much, and Night At Sky Church offers little ""new"" from their back catalog, but does debut some great Red Velvet Car material on concert DVD!

The biggest problem with this DVD is the sound!  It really sounds awful.  I was actually looking forward to it on the strength of the two live bonus tracks on my edition of Red Velvet Car.  ""Magic Man"" and especially ""Never"" sounded freaking amazing, and I think it's from the same concert.  But the sound on the DVD is awful.  Ann isn't loud enough, and there's just no strength in the sound.  It's like a fairly good bootleg.

If you're a Heart fan like me, you'll enjoy the DVD.  But be prepared.  Good...but disappointing."
1055,4.0,"This is a really great presentation.  Audio, video, editing (not too crazy frenetic like some concert vids), stage production, and performances are all sound.  The extras are also decent.  So why four stars instead of five?  Because RJD acts so freaking weird onstage that it's sometimes hard to watch.  He gestures like Celine Dion, chats up the crowd like Tom Jones, and fitzes with his hair like a preening old lady.  I don't get it, but if you were to cut out all of his between-the-song bits, this would earn one more star."
1056,5.0,"Oh man. I was so pumped when I saw this at Best Buy for $20. I couldn't believe it. I snapped it up immediately and watched it with my dad right when we got home. Other than the small disappointment of not having ""Uptown Girl"" or ""Big Shot"" on there, it was freaking awesome. The mixing is pretty tight with the exception of Joel's mix being a bit too loud sometimes, or like on ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" where the backup singers' mix was a bit too light. But overall, it was beautiful.

Highlight: 57,000 people singing the lyrics to ""Piano Man"". Wow. Mind blowing.

Also, Roger Daltrey, Paul McCartney, Steven Tyler, John Mellencamp, and Tony Bennett show up. Holy crap. My mind exploded.

Definitely buy this. Billy Joel plays with such enthusiasm and his band is absolutely amazing. Modern musicians can't hold a candle to these guys when it comes to live music. No autotune here, baby."
1057,4.0,"I'm a huge horror fan and the scream film franchise is one of my favorites, so when I heard they were finally doing a 4th movie I couldn't wait to see it, and I did, first show, opening day, and I DID like it, and it was well made, there just felt like there was something missing...

The 4th in the series again focuses on Sidney Prescott as she returns to Woodsboro promoting her ""tell all"" book when a new string of Ghost Face murders begin.

Of coarse these are ""who's the killer"" movies so I won't spoil the ending for you if you haven't seen it, but overall I did enjoy the movie, didn't see the end coming, and thought the reasoning behind the killer's methods were believable and very timely. With that being said, I still felt like something was missing with this sequel that the others had, that this one didn't.

There were no BIG things that bothered me about the overall story or direction (as Wes Craven proves he still can pack a punch) there were though several little things that bothered me, like ""Curby"" (Hayden Panettiere) although she is quite good in the movie and one of the hottest chicks working in Hollywood today, I think they really dropped the ball on her overall look, fashion wise. I'm not in high school anymore so maybe I don't know exactly what's the HOT fashion with teenage girls but I don't think it's sleek leather jackets and overtly short hair. She didn't dress like a high school girl from the Mid-West, she dressed like what I would think Wes Craven's assistant working in Hollywood would dress!

Also, Cohen, oops, I'm sorry, I meant that goofy cop with Anthony Anderson. I assume that Wes Craven isn't the biggest  OC fan so I can't really blame this one on him but if you are an OC fan like I am, and a lot of you out there are, it was more than a little distracting seeing Cohen in this role. I call him that because literally that's the only thing I kept thinking whenever he was one screen, ""That's not a cop, that's Cohen in a cop uniform!"" I'm sure he is not aware of this (and apparently no one else on set was) but everything from the character's mannerisms, to his smart-alec personality, to even his freaking HAIR screamed COHEN, not a cop in a small town! I know I'm nitpicking but these things bothered me.

The only big thing that bothered me about the film wasn't the film overall, itself, it's good, it's the fact that I just couldn't get that super excitement I did when I was a kid and the first three films hit theaters. I remember being a kid waiting on pins and needles for the new scream movie to come out, wandering who the killer was this time, and is it finally DEWEY? (which it never is!) Somehow I just couldn't get back that feeling. I guess you can make a good movie, but it's impossible to create magic. It either happens or it doesn't, it did with the original three films but not so much with this one. With that being said it's still a great movie and a must own to round-out your scream collection.

P. S. The DVD has one of the most enjoyable audio commentary tracks I have ever listen to featuring director Wes Craven, stars Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere and a brief session with Neve Campbell. It's hilarious to listen to a seventy-something Wes Craven trying to get a word in edgewise with two early-twenty something girls who are talking a mile a minute with Hayden Panettiere having to change her shirt during the commentary realizing that she had it on backwards the whole time! To bad there wasn't a VIDEO commentary for us guys!"
1058,2.0,"Capitalizing on 300, we now have branched out into making up new greek myths.

We did Troy, why not the Odyssey?  That might have been good.  Or make a version of the Iliad where the gods are involved like they were in the story by Homer.

This just left me asking all sorts of questions during the movie, which is never good.  If I'm asking questions, it means that I am not remotely immersed in the story.

If Hyperion had a bow that could blast a 30 foot diameter hole in a solid block wall, why didn't he just take an extra five minutes to shoot a couple more arrows into the Hellenic army and win the final fight before it started?  He just couldn't be bothered?  He didn't want to guarantee victory?  He just gathered an army of thousands, marched them across a desert, wiped out the Hellenic villages and majority of their soldiers, but he had some other crap to do that night and was in a hurry?

Why would anyone go fight for Hyperion in the first place?  His leadership qualities are not inspiring, he has his employees smacked in the groin with a giant mallet so they won't reproduce.  Those soldiers who don't get their giggleberries crunched get stabbed or get their eyes poked out.  His management style is highly questionable.  I'm pretty sure I'd seek alternative employment.

If the gods could instantly teleport themselves to Olympus and back, maybe that would have been a good thing to do when getting stabbed in the crotch area by a titan.  I like to avoid getting stabbed in the crotch myself.  I cant help but assume that gods like to avoid getting stabbed in the jimmy also.  Poseidon, or at least I figured it was Poseidon (he had a trident after all), didn't seem to be in favor of being on the receiving end of the whole crotch stabbing.  Good time to jet back to Olympus real quick.

How did this army of what appears to be hundreds of thousands get across what appears to be a very unforgiving desert?  Where did they get food and water.  The logisitics are baffling.  I liked the movie 'Kingdom of Heaven', as they address this issue directly.  Here we just have this huge freaking army sitting around, waiting to go kill some folk for a boss who is kind of a dick to begin with."
1059,4.0,"i finaly got to see this movie.i thought it was going to be a continuation of the wolverine movie,which it wasnt.although he did make a cameo appearance long enough to make me laugh really really hard.it was difficult for me to follow the movie because the characters used thier human names for most of the movie.i had to keep a mental list of which characters had which abilities abnd which comic book characters they were.the real thing that bothered me was,once again,the movie makers tossed the real story right out the freaking window .professer x as an english hipster?the messed up original line up was all screwy too.i believe it was professer x,cyclops[not his brother havoc],angel[the boy one not a stripper girl who wasn't even the same race],beast,jean grey,and ice man.only half of them were in this movie.and don't go quoting the other x men movies because they are all messed up too.
  but,messed up facts aside,the movie was great! there was a lot of cool mutant stuff going on,a lot of questions answered,a huge amount of action and it was awesome.it was the ""revenge of the sith"" of the x-men movies.of which there are 5.i'd place this one 4th over all.but,i really like them all.so,4th is still spectacular.
  the characters they DO USE are a hipster professer X,beast,magneto[good guy],mystique[good girl],havoc,darwin,a girl angel,banshee,and a few others im probably forgetting.the movie focuses around magneto and professor X when they were still erik and charles.the bad guys were a blonde teklekinet ive never heard of,a red nightcrawler type guy,a unamed guy with the same powers of skull fire and some more.the original brotherhood of evil mutant members in the comics were magneto,blob,quicksilver,pyro,scarlet witch and toad.once again,not even close.
  HOWEVER,like i said,the movie is still an awesome movie.and i WOULD recomend you buy it.especialy if you are a comic book or action fan.it does have a lot of great scenes and it does answer tons of questions about how things happened.i mentioned ""revenge of the sith"" earlier.well,much in the same way as ""rots"" answered questioned about star wars,this movie answeres questions about the x-men trilogy and xmen in general.
  there are a lot of action scenes and military stuff going on that bridge between WW2 and the bay of pigs[1940's to 1962].so be ready for that.there are also a bunch of science scenes but not so much that it gets old like in ""the hulk"" and ""iron man"".as far as the actors and actresses go,i can only remember seeing one of them in any other movie.the CO on a battleship is a CO on the movie ""starship troopers"".but,i will admit i have trouble telling one blonde skank from another.they all look the same to me.plastic like a barbie doll and bottom feeders.so maybe theyve been around.and chances are they have.i think this one chick who i ended up hating in the movie may have been a girl i hated in ""batman begins"" now that i think about it.
  go get it!"
1060,3.0,"The movie is entertaining, but the story writing and scripting was pretty bad. There were a lot of scenes where everyone didn't actually have real dialogue, so they said ""uhh, yeah, umm"" and that kind of thing a lot. The action is pretty good, the basic story was pretty good. It is good for a watch. If you liked the originals with Tobey Maguire, you will hate this one. I thought Tobey Maguire was one of the worst actors ever because he never changed expression and had a very dull personality in every single one of his movies, so I thought anything was better than him. The only real complaint I have about modern movies in general is the portrayal of high tech areas and labs and stuff, which this movie has a lot of. The way movies see to have this is the pull and push screen things, as if 3D rotational computer projects exist right now. All the keycard entry door panels have been replaced by ipods, seriously, that is what they are with a useless entry system that anyone can break. They even did the same thing with the fire alarm, a virtual fire alarm, that is freaking retarded and impractical. This issue is related to this movie, but Hollywood in general. The lesson is better story and less shiny, impractical crap that would never actually exist.

As for the case, it was embarrassing to say the least... The blurays were in their holders like they should be along with the ultraviolet disc, but for those who have a DVD player, it was like a middle finger to them. The DVD was put in a cheap PC startup disc looking envelope and just thrown in there. In the Pirates of the Caribbean 5 disc set, everything was in its correct holder, so there was no excuse for the packaging. Instant minus 1 star on that."
1061,1.0,"This was Ed Wood with a big budget. First off,  Christian Bale's ""I have a mouth full of oatmeal/I have a really bad cold/I sing for a death metal band"" Batman voice is freaking hilarious. Then you have Bane's voice which sounded like they dubbed in Sean Connery doing a bad ""Cherman"" accent. Every time Bane spoke I had to suppress the giggles.
My all time favorite implausible movie moment occurs in this film when Bruce, back broken by Bane, was hung by a rope by two fellow pit dwellers in order to heal him.  The one pit dweller points out that Bruce has a broken vertebra sticking out his back. He then punches Bruce in the back & says, ""You will hang there until you can walk."" Now, I'm not sure what chiropractor's school the fellow attended but I'm pretty sure that wouldn't....ummmm...you know....work to fix his freaking back. Nevertheless, Batman is soon pumping out push ups & sit ups like a champ.

Finally, back to Batman's ""mouth full of oatmeal"" voice. There's a bit near the end where Batman, talking about the soon to explode bomb, says something like ""I can take it out into the bay."" But it was nearly unintelligible due to the mouth full oatmeal that Batman keeps on hand so no one will recognize his voice.
I so badly wanted Catwoman to say, ""Huh?"" Of course, Batman would then forcibly remumble his statement. To which Catwoman would reply, ""Nope, still not getting it. Just one more time."" Batman would then re-remumble only to have Catwoman say, ""You really think your gay? Look I'm not that this is the time to discuss your sexuality but, come to think of it, it does go far towards explaining your fascination with black plether & vinyl...."""

1063,5.0,Limited and freaking awesome!
1064,3.0,"I've been a mild fan of Spider-man since the 1970s.  That was when I read the British reprints of the classic 1963-67 Marvel originals.  The Lizard, Doc Octopus, the Kingpin, even The Living Brain all thrilled me when I was a kid.  This movie is a well-made and impeccably acted tribute to those originals, updated to a contemporary setting.  The dialogue, costuming, lighting, FX, sound are all fine.  The music knows its place in the movie, and it generally works well.  The one thing that did annoy me was... the main villain here just doesn't look right.  Ditko's original 1960s comic-book version of him is so memorable. Yet it's not as if the film-makers changed the villain to make him more scary.  Because he isn't that scary.  He's an unconvincing cobbled-together blend of the Hulk, Dragon-man from the Kirby's Fantastic Four, Gozilla, and a guy in a rubber suit.  As a super-villain his visual style simply lacks the all-important Marvel sense of _style_.  But I wonder if that change was deliberate?  The movie probably works really really well for the 12 year-old who is 'new to the whole Spider-man thing'.  If those people are the intended audience, then the film-makers probably didn't want to make the villain too scary - because that would risk all those over-protective moms freaking out and renting _Beverly Hills Chihuahua 3_ instead.  Apart from that fairly heavy central flaw (the other is that Spider-man does Web searches using Bing, and yet is supposed to be intelligent) the first two-thirds of the movie are interesting and generally great fun.  Even the 'luv interest' sections are watchable, mainly for the comedic teenage awkwardness.  But towards the end the movie gets very choppy, and the audience heads into the most predictable of formula finishes. But overall... _Amazing Spider-man_ is nicely made and worth seeing, and is certainly vastly more entertaining than the first reboot."
1065,4.0,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

At heart, every permutation of the ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise has been a searing denouncement of humanity and its numerous vices, especially basic stupidity. However, ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (hereafter ""Rise"")catapults human idiocy to near-stratospheric levels. Roger Ebert writes in his ""Rise"" review, ""..the movie has its pleasures, although human intelligence is not one of them."" The simian ascension will be a cakewalk. Consider the examples of human stupidity throughout the movie:

1. Gen-Sys, the corporation for which the human protagonist Will Rodman (James Franco) works as a pharmaceutical scientist, boasts appalling security and ethical lapses. Of course, the first transgression involves Caesar's chimpanzee mother, Bright Eyes, who has received an infusion of the mind-enhancing drug, AZ-112.

Not only does Gen-Sys lack the facilities to avert her subsequent rampage of destruction, it isn't even aware that she gave birth to Caesar and that her maternal protective instincts triggered her rage.

2. Will's well-intentioned but ill-advised benevolence compels him to save the infant Caesar from his mother's fate. He decides to raise Caesar at home like a human child. Bad move. Introducing a potentially wild and destructive beast into a suburban neighborhood, including a chimpanzee, even a gifted one like Caesar is asking for trouble. Remember the story of the woman whose face was mutilated by a neighbor's ""pet"" chimpanzee and who required years of reconstructive surgery? Inevitably, Caesar intervenes between Will's Alzheimers-afflicted father Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) and an irate neighbor to protect the former, injures the latter, and is condemned to live at a brutal ape sanctuary in San Francisco.

3. Will's love interest, primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) could have provided valuable insights into chimpanzee behavior, intellect, and motivations, and perhaps could have helped avert the climactic ""ape escape"". But instead of acting like Jane Goodall, Caroline merely makes vague pronouncements about how dangerous ""cute"" chimps really are and how we really shouldn't mess with them, and with genetic science in general. She turns out to be distracting eye candy.

4. Again, good-intentioned but ethically-challenged Will absconds with some of the AZ-112 formula from his security- challenged company to inject into his father to re-enhance his cognitive abilities. It works, but only temporarily.

5. Meanwhile, the imprisoned Caesar has to endure yet another shabbily maintained and guarded facility, an ape enclosure managed by two louts, the clueless proprietor John Landon (Brian Cox) and his son, abusive animal wrangler Dodge Landon (Tom Felton), plus a third individual.

6. Why are there seemingly only three people managing a vast wildlife preserve containing (improbably) hundreds of chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas? Even without his AZ-enhanced genius, Caesar, I think, would not have had too much difficulty escaping from that minimum-security dump?

7. Will manages to synthesize a more permanent, powerful version of AZ-112 (AZ-113, naturally) and attempts to test it on another chimpanzee. Lax security strikes again, the ape writhes on the table, a side-effect virus spreads to one of the handlers present (who has lost his sterilizing mask), and the guy later goes out into public without any decontamination procedures to bleed, sneeze, and spread the virus. Just great.

8. Clever Caesar escapes, finds his way back to Will's house, obtains some AZ-113, which Will has again appropriated from his sieve of a company, and uses it to ""brain-boost"" his fellow simian inmates, and engineers a jail break.

9. Foolishly, the vicious, taser-wielding Dodge allows Caesar to electrocute him with water from a hose.

10. Roughly two hundred escaped apes, led by Caesar, romp through San Francisco towards escape over the Golden Gate Bridge. A few cops on horseback with machine guns (and horrible aim) and a couple of helicopters is the best defense the city can muster? Where's the freaking National Guard? No wonder the apes have a relatively easy time making it to the Muir redwoods sanctuary.

11. In the movie postscript, the AZ-113 virus (which humans are susceptible to but to which apes are immune) is spread by an airline pilot and becomes an epidemic.

12. Thanks, Will. Your good intentions have paved a road to a hell of tort and criminal liability, not to mention the probable extinction of the human race and the subsequent ape ascendancy. At least the dinosaurs had the (arguable) excuse of an asteroid for their superseding by the mammals. And dinosaurs are supposed to be dumb?

And yet, despite this relentless parade of dumbness, I really did enjoy the movie. The simian protagonist Caesar (motion-capture animated by Andy Serkis) is mainly responsible. His resourceful intellect, his ""Frankenstein monster"" plight, his sufferings, his clemency and his organization of an eventual worldwide revolution is well-paced and gripping. The movie's creators want you to be in his corner and you are. If that involves stacking the deck against humans, well so be it. Humans have had their day. Let the apes have a crack at it. In the next sequels, let's see how they do.

P.S. During the movie, an expedition to Mars is lost in space. It is called Icarus. How apt. In mythology, Icarus flew too close to the sun on wax wings, had them melt, and fell to earth. If and when the Icarus crew falls back to earth, what bizarre reception can they expect?"
1066,3.0,"The fact that the DVD doesn't get all the features of the Blu-Ray is lame!  I understand that SOME Blu-ray features require the Blue-Ray technology, but give us the freaking Making Of videos.

And although I have only seen this movie twice prior to buying it,  the movie is only Very Decent, as opposed to the Mind-Numbingly Awesomesauce most people were expecting."
1067,5.0,I really loved this movie!!! It's the best movie in the trilogy and the best Superhero movie of all time! It was worth the 4 year wait and I can't wait to get this when it comes out on Blu-ray! I saw this movie 3 times in the movie theatres and it's the only movie I have ever saw at the theatres more than once! This is now my most favorite movie of all time with The Dark Knight being my close second! The Dark Knight Rises is the perfect conclusion to the best trilogy of all time!! The Dark Knight Rises is by far the best movie of 2012!! It was so freaking awesome!!!
1068,4.0,"As soon as ""The Dark Knight Rises"" begins, you're practically guaranteed to have goosebumps. The opening scene is hair-raising; it's exciting, it's blood-pumping, it gives you an idea of what to expect over the next two hours and forty four minutes. You're practically tossed around, choked out, and physically manhandled by Bane nearly every moment he's on-screen. No, he's not as big as he was in the comics but he's still pretty freaking big. Tom Hardy is sensational. His eyes are so expressive, angry, and cold. Even though his actions will probably be the first thing you remember about the character, his eyes will practically haunt you during his performance.

The entire cast is really phenomenal though. Christian Bale is still a solid Bruce Wayne/Batman, but it certainly seems as though he's more of a foundation for the rest of the cast to be greater than he is. Anne Hathaway is mesmerizing as Selina Kyle. Her being cast in the role seemed a bit underwhelming at first, but she surprises you. She makes the Catwoman character her own; she's intelligent, sexy, always has something quick-witted to say, and you figure out just enough about her to want her to be around more often than she is.

The direction the Alfred character goes in is really interesting. He just wants what's best for Bruce, but does something that is easily the most difficult decision of his entire life. Michael Caine is extraordinary. He plays the father figure so perfectly. Gary Oldman shines, as well. Oldman is pretty great in every role he has anyway, but this is the first time in one of the Batman films where he's had to defend his actions. Oldman is so absorbing and enticing whenever he loses his cool or gets angry in a film. Newcomer Joseph Gordon-Levitt also deserves some recognition. Constantly called a hothead by his superior, Jim Gordon takes him under his wing. The John Blake character is so passionate about what he thinks is right and what he thinks Batman should be doing and Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a fantastic job portraying that.

Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for the film is easily one of the best this year has had to offer. There's enough familiarity in the soundtrack to trigger nostalgic moments from the two previous films, but it adds something raw and visceral during the chants and during anything that plays in the background when Bane is on screen. A song like ""The Fire Rises"" is haunting in a way and the music is so sharp; it cuts to your very bones. Pounding drums, horns that seem to bide their time and start low and then scream when you least expect it, and strings played so vigorously that you expect to hear them snap and break at some point. Meanwhile, the slower songs like ""Mind If I Cut In"" rely on something like a simple piano arrangement but also seem kind of playful at the same time to adhere to Selina Kyle.

There are certain things in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" that make it really solid and one of the best third installments of any franchise, if not the best; the main one being the last twenty minutes or so. The conclusion is spectacular and it seems like Christopher Nolan built this entire near-three-hour spectacle around these key moments. It is near perfect and satisfying in almost every way.

The other thing is how Nolan was able to bring so much back from not only ""The Dark Knight,"" but also ""Batman Begins"" and makes this feel that much more conclusive. Characters you remember are mentioned, Bruce's childhood is brought up on more than one occasion, and the whole movie is just littered with references and throwbacks to what this franchise has already accomplished. It feels like everything comes full circle and that this chapter of Batman is indeed over.

Everything in between the jaw-dropping opening and the amazing conclusion feels so familiar though. There are new characters while old ones are taken down new paths and the destruction being done to Gotham is on the biggest scale this universe has ever seen, but if it wasn't for the well-written screenplay it would feel a bit repetitive. As you play the movie over in your head after it ends (and you will, more than once), you begin to see things and wonder why they weren't expanded on.

One of them being that Selina Kyle is terrified of Bane. She's obviously familiar with what he's done in the past or had some sort of run-in with him. Their past is never really fully explained and the two characters don't really have any screen time together. Then there's the obvious nitpick of not being fully able to understand Bane at all times. It'll just give you an excuse to see it again, honestly.

""The Dark Knight Rises"" is final in the best of ways. It is overflowing with explosive action, features passionate performances from every part of the cast, and is just completely and totally engrossing from beginning to end. Some are calling it a masterpiece, but it doesn't quite reach that status. ""The Dark Knight Rises"" is really quite good and even great at times, but doesn't obtain the same level of brilliance its predecessor did."
1069,2.0,"Okay, to begin with the civilized world has already survived, with minor intteruptions of the time's basic services major pandemics so the entire premise of Apocalypse from it is absurd. If anything things would be LESS precious, because we'd have less demand on resources. Plus the idea that the government would simply abadon everything and everyone has already shown itself to be untrue. Were the scenario that we were hit by a meteor, I'd find this more credible. As it is---an absurd valentine to survivalists from the get go.

Even suspending disbelief and going with the premise--there's just soooooo much stupid that I found myself laughing all over the place. Water, food and fuel are precious, yet the family is able to last 4 months after the fact, still driving around in LA? They should've siphoned the fuel out of their car and ridden off with their neighbors when they had the chance. Also, they're finally prompted to leave (and are shocked) by looting. Isn't looting in LA like, basically, Tuesday? Also, why were the looters stealing big screen TVs when there hadn't been power for months? What could they possibly do with those?

Soooooo with (again) fuel and water being at a premium, they decide to go to Idaho---as opposed to the much closer Northern CA or Southern, OR where there'd be more rain---negating the water sacrcity issue. Actually, they could've just gone to the beach with 2 tarps and a plastic bowl and turned ocean water into fresh water. And even though they're gonna take a road trip and know how dangerous LA is, they feel no need to bring a spare tire or even flat fix spray.

They also don't ""get"" the concept of jam packed highways (even though they live in LA), so they have to flee the city limits on foot. Of course once out of the city, they're able to snag a new SUV off a dead guy and go skipping off on their trip through the desert (with limited water---which again, could've been avoided if they had simply headed for the Redwoods and the food and shelter they'd provide). One of my favorite vignettes during their desert trek is the dad freaking out over wasting water for teeth brushing. The mom responds with ""but we've gotta brush our teeth"". Really? in survival mode and worying about oral hygiene. I think tooth paste wouldn't have even made it into my ""bug out bag"". If I have cavity versus dead, I'll take the cavity.

During their Mojave desert adventure they save one injured dude, encounter a little girl with a 12 guage (that has no kickback when she shoots it) and the wife kills a dude to protect her man. After she blows away the guy, she freaks out and blows chucks, in the process they lose their car and all their provisions, yet again. So now they walk through the blistering desert during the day, resting at night. Except basic common sense says to travel at night when it's cooler and rest during the day.

Also super stupid? They ""save"" themselves by drinking radiator water filtered through the dad's filthy dusty shirt and then heated with a convenient car battery and steel wool (the house had steel wool and a battery, but no coffee filters?). That water would've killed them, since it would've contained anti-freeze, rust, battery acid, etc. Not to mention, there would've been water in the desert plants and cacti all around them.

As they're stupidly walking through the daytime desert, all at death's door, who should drive up behind them but the dude whose life they saved way back down the road. How convenient. He takes them to some fundy town run by its sherrif/warlord just over the Nevada border, where they're inexplicably allowed to live and join the community (as opposed to the previous guarded small town, where they were shot at).

Also inexplicably, the fundy Nevada DESERT town not only has water, but has enough that they can wash bed linens and return to normal level of cleanliness. They actually whine about how ugly their ""new"" dishware is. In the fundy town, they're safe, fed and secure--they do have to attend church and hear about how pissed off Jesus is at them AND Sherrif Warlord shoots looters in front of everyone, but hey, even super progressive, agnostic me would've been singing about my friend Jesus and keeping my trap shut. Not our idiots, they leave as soon as possible on a truck bed and inexplicably make their way to the land of promise, Idaho (where there would've been MORE freaky survivalists, but one is not supposed to know that).

In Idaho, they become farmers and the Dad becomes a naturopath---but is unable to save himself from an infected cut (ummmmm...). Fast forward 25 years, their whiney son is now a gorwn up father, the community is still under gun protection (somehow they never run out of bullets, even though manufacturing has snut down?).

And the ""experts"" blather about how there will never again be any sort of technology and no one will live in cities again. Except even that makes zero sense: Most US cities are on major bodies of fresh water---it's why they were settled in the first place. Not to mention it's why cities were settled 5,000+ years ago. Plus there's been varying forms of technology for as long as there's been civilization---developed by people with far less knowledge than we have today. Not to mention, generators have been around for a long, long time.

While I suppose one should be somewhat prepared for emergencies---and absolutely ""the big one"" could hit us at any time (at which point we'd be dead, anyway). This was probably sillier than Gilligan's Island."
1070,5.0,"I know a lot of fans regard Season 4 as the best season but for me, it has to be Season 5 hands down, for so many reasons. First off, we get the introduction of Jack- who I absolute LOVE! I love how we get to see more of Shawn's family on a more permanent basis including his father Chet. The season premiere was such an awesome start to the season. Also, we finally get fan's favorite, Shawn and Angela this season. They are so freaking cute together! :) This season we also got the storyline of Lauren. I personally adore her and Cory together and honestly thought that he should have nixed Topanga and gotten with Lauren because they are SO PRECIOUS! together (I love the scene when they're outside and they're fooling around in the rain; and when Lauren kisses him). - Moving on, my fav episode, def in my Top 5, has to be ""And Then There Was Shawn."" - I had never watched this show regularly when it was on cable and so I got caught up on this show on DVD, and OMG! I have never laughed as hard as I did watching this episode. It was hilarious! And I laugh and get the same bellyaches each and every time I watch it. Season 5 also had a bunch of other surprises and storylines, as did all the rest of the seasons, but Season 5 is totally my Number 1 season!!"
1071,2.0,"The film starts off by informing the viewer that the events in the film are fictional and that all the stunts are performed by actors, but by the end of it you're likely to forget about that. Especially since they added the little ""after-bio"" right before the credits started. When that popped up my first thought was ""was this based off something that really happened? o. O"" Then my brain turned on again and I remembered the warning at the beginning.

This film is labeled as a comedy, but I don't see how. There wasn't anything comedic about it. It was just a party gone very, very wrong. That's really all this movie is, it's a party film. There's a lot of scene's where you just see the party going on and they have music playing. Maybe it's because I'm not a party person, but the entire movie felt very lifeless. This is the third movie in a week that I've seen that had a lot of potential, but they didn't capitalize on it.

It's filmed as if it were a home movie, with Dax Flame ""filming"" it the entire time. Me personally, I would've liked to see more of Dax. It took me a while to remember what I saw him in, but for those of you still having trouble he was in 21 Jump Street. His character seemed to be the one I liked best, even though he only had a total of like 5 lines.

Throughout the movie you see a lot of drinking, dancing, topless women, and Thomas, the guy throwing the party, freaking out. What I don't get is why do they always have these movies where the outcasted kid throws the party and he winds up being paranoid the entire time? We all know that kind of thing never happens. It's always the ""popular"" people that throw the party. Granted, his paranoia soon became reality as the party escalated and turned into a small riot.

By the end of it nothing really stuck with me. There were a few things here and there like Thomas jumping off of the roof or the kid getting punched by the neighbor, but other than that it isn't very memorable. What this film does do well is make you feel like you're actually there. By doing so watching this is kind of like an adrenaline rush, but sadly that's the only strong thing about the movie.

Overall Score: 4/10 - After watching this my reaction was ""meh."" When I saw the previews this movie looked like it was going to be crazy, and it could have been, but the end result is only mildly entertaining. If you're looking to check it out I would suggest renting it first."
1072,5.0,"This movie was so freaking funny we had to buy it! It was a non thinking movie and the characters were well chosen. I love Jennifer and she was great as well. I am in my 40's and not into the teen movies or chick flicks but this is one well worth seeing. Simple as that. You want to laugh this will have you laughing. Some of the scenes Paul Rudd did had me in tears laughing. Now the word ""Dick"" has so much more meaning!!! Just simple comedy"
1073,5.0,This movie is so freaking funny.  I love it.  Some of my favorite actors and they definitely deliver. It is funny while still being family friendly.  There are some parts that aren't great but it's not like a lot of dirty movies out these days.
1074,5.0,"I am new to this version of Sherlock Holmes. To be honest I didn't get into this series because I thought that Holmes was just being stretched to far what with the Downey/ Law movie versions and the CBS television show. I love Guy Ritchie's take on the detective and love both movies. Looking forward to the third. The CBS television show has grown on me and I now watch it as well. What finally drew me in was the stars. I first saw Cumberbach (Sherlock) on the 2nd installment of J.J. Abrams revision of ""STAR TREK - INTO DARKNESS"" and absolutely was awed at Mr. Cumberbach's performance. And I soon followed that with his performance in ""TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE"". Second was Martin Freeman who I remember from the original British series ""THE OFFICE"" and then I saw his wonderful performance as Bilbo Baggins in ""THE HOBBIT"" films. All of this exposure inevitably forced me to check out episode one of the SHERLOCK series.
I was absolutely freaking blown away by the first season's episodes and then came ""A Scandal In Belgravia"" I haven't been this engrossed in watching a film as this one had me in quite a long time. Absolutely freaking perfect. The story, the acting, the whole package.
I love this show and hope in goes on for many years to come. I have read every Arthur Conan Doyle story so I am not a fly by night fan. I was very satisfied with this version and now I believe that the greatness of these characters can span all timelines and all types of senarios.
Well done to the creators of this series and the writing is inspired.
I will recommend this to everyone that I know."

first of all it's a really old series that should be going for less then $10...the freaking dvd is region whatever so you can't even play it here in America unless you waste more money and more time going out to buy a special expensive dvd player that can actually play the freaking disk!!
....
out of all the marvel cartoon's it is obvious that Thor was the worst of all and the least exciting...iron man, spiderman, captain America, fantastic four, x-men ect.. all way better then this garbage thor cartoon...overpriced and you cant even buy it from amazonprime meaning you might not even end up getting it, or get it 1week-2months later which is stupid!!!

don't get this rip off please!!!!!"

1079,4.0,"***SPOILERS***

The movie starts out with our killing machine, Edward Glenn (Dolph) in a no-win situation, then flashes back. He is now in bed with a gold digging blond asking him for a new car while they make love because her current car is ""so last year."" (Brief nudity) He gets a call from his wife (or ex-wife) about attending his daughter's play. Dolph seems cold and heartless. Later we find out he is an ex-KGB assassin working for the Russian mob. He has a real day job as an investment broker. He goes to Hong Kong on an assignment. He murders his target and a bunch of other people, but allows a witness (being tortured by his target) to live. He returns home and is questioned if he left any witnesses. He answers in the negative and gets another assignment. He has to go to Miami ASAP and take out a man that weekend. However, it is his turn to have his daughter that weekend as mom goes frolics with her boyfriend. Edward leaves the girl with his floozy girlfriend and drives off to the airport. The floozy doesn't want to take care of the kid so she palms her off on the housekeeper. Meanwhile Edward is on his way to the airport on the phone with his wife, convincing her he just had supper with Taylor(daughter) and she had just gone to bed. He is just out getting a few items for breakfast, he claims. Then BAM! He is sent on a detour, which turns out to be a trap. People attempt to kill him as he has been set up. He manages to escape and get his daughter to safety then goes to save his wife. After they met up, there is a gun battle with people in police uniforms and her boyfriend gets killed. They end up hiding out together and she asks, ""Are you doing something illegal?"" DUH! He doesn't answer her until after she puts out. Odd. When I get a woman's boyfriend killed, it is rare that they have sex with me the same freaking night.

While I gave away half the movie, the rest is trying to figure out who set him up and the payback. As it turns out our cold heartless killer left his family so they wouldn't get caught up in his world and get killed. A little like OJ, ""so if I left you and made love to a blond girl half your age, that would mean I love you."""
1080,4.0,"f you were to take anime as art reflecting the real world you would figure Japanese high schools to be places full of huge chested girls, oblivious guys who don't realize that six girls want to pork him, and you'd probably get the idea that Japanese high school kids get nosebleeds upon seeing the cleavage of a woman. These are not actually true as Japanese high schools are not much better than any other high schools and the only reason anime treats high school as a place of fun, violence, chests, and more chests is because it makes high school a much more exciting place than it actually is.

Baka and Test reflects the real world almost as well as the Jersey Shore. It is in fact so opposite of the real world it is probably a mirror dimension. The high school is a place of tests, tests, and more tests. Upon entrance, you take a test that decides what class you will be in, A through F. F is of course the idiots and A is the nerds. F students have to deal with crappy wooden tables and pillows while A gets personal desks, lounge chairs, tables, a refreshment bar, and a giant wall of television screens. Our hero is Yoshi, a complete idiot who has a friend in Himeji, a very smart girl who wound up in the F class for getting sick and leaving during the placement test, thus giving her a zero. Together with their friends in the class they battle their way to the top through the use of avatars. Everyone in the school has one that has stats dependent on how well they do on tests in various subjects. Thus, the higher the grade, the harder their avatars hit. It's pretty much a school version of a JRPG where instead of health potions, students run to take recovery tests during battles to regain lost hit points. It's a rather smart idea I must say and actually works out kind of well. I don't think watching people compare test scores and take tests has been this exciting.

This plot of the underdogs taking on the big guys is of course a clich but works perfectly well here due to the peppering of strange and eclectic characters that ultimately lends this series the comedy aspect it should be known for. The plot is both downright ridiculous and hilarious and while there is not a lot of plot to go around, there is enough to add some semi-serious bits in throughout.

There are a couple of problems with the plot. There is a lot of romance being thrown around and it doesn't really go anywhere. A love letter by a certain character is never given to another certain character despite this love letter being a main point of the plot. Another thing I found was I don't understand the science behind an avatar being hurt and Yoshi feeling it. Nobody else can feel their avatar's being hurt, only Yoshi can because of his terrible scores, but it still seems nonsensical. But that's just a tiny complaint that shouldn't even matter considering I'm watching a show to laugh, not get a deep, engaging, realistic plot.

And I did laugh, and so will you. This show is replete with sexual humor that may turn some people away but when an anime uses Apocalypse Now Redux in a joke, I think it deserves a cookie. On top of that was a random cameo by Miku Hatsune (whose back is turned in Class B) and it also references other anime. Yes, it does have lots of chests. And as I've previously stated, chests do not a good joke make. This anime somehow made me laugh at chests. That's right. I laughed at boob jokes. I didn't laugh at the constant use of Himeji's breasts and Yoshi's sister's breasts as some form of fan service I guess, but I did laugh at Shimada's constantly comparing her breasts to Himeji's and being jealous. The overabundance of boobies also spills over into how characters act, which creates a particularly silly character but we'll talk about him in a moment.

The animation is nothing fantastic. It has this look as if it were a colored-in manga but it's not a style I found particularly appealing. The dots everywhere and the sometimes rather dull colors made it seem like an older anime, maybe 2005-ish. The animation also seemed rather lackluster in the fight scenes where a lot of the time we see an overhead view with little circles representing the characters instead of watching the characters actually fight. While this is not a huge issue, I feel as if the animators were lazy when producing these segments.

Sound quality is actually good. I committed high treason and watched the dub which turned out to be rather pleasant. None of the voices were grating and I felt that it actually kept the integrity of the original script without taking away any of the funny bits. Now the opening and closing on the other hand are another matter altogether. The opening is lame and basic and could have been tacked onto anything. The ending is meh, not bad but not particularly good.

The characters are what make this show what it is. Yoshi is the oblivious idiot, a character archetypical of the genre but hilarious nonetheless. Himeji has big boobs and about as little personality as one would expect from the love interest. Shimada is the hot-headed and overly violent girl who does not like her tiny boobs being made fun of. She likes Yoshi, as does Himeji though they never fight over him. They seem to be a unified effort all the time. The problem with Shimada is the fact that another girl is in love with her and is stalking the crap out of her. The same can actually be said of Yoshi who is being teased by a gay guy from Class A a lot of times.

Class representative of class F, Sakamoto is in a contract with the representative of A, Kirishima. Kirishima wants to marry him and does everything she can to be with him while Sakamoto wants nothing to do with it leading to some hilarious moments.

Hideyoshi is quite possibly one of the most interesting and hilarious characters of the show. A guy who looks like a girl but constantly dresses like a girl for whatever reason. The girls are jealous of how hot he is as a girl and the guys all seem to find him attractive as well. This leads to utter confusion half the time and while Hideyoshi's character is never explained (why does he dress like a girl if he wants to be treated as a guy?) he still provides enough hilarious moments to make that question void.

Finally, Kouta is a hentai who takes pictures of everyone's boobs and panties and is constantly dying of nosebleeds. He has started a book on the boobs of all the girls in the school. He is utterly hilarious.

And we can't forget Iron Man, the remedial class teacher. When a student dies during a battle with their avatars Iron Man swoops in like a superhero and takes them to remedial classes. This guy is freaking great.

There's also Yoshi's sister who seems to want to have sex with him. I won't explain any further because the anime doesn't either.

What else is there to say about this show? It made me laugh every episode and while it may feel a little inconsistent at times (the semi-serious episodes and the flat out comedy episodes aren't mixed together proportionally) it still is one of the most entertaining comedy anime I've seen. Sure it doesn't wrap up tightly, sure it doesn't have an amazing story, but who cares? It's freaking hilarious. The characters are not all original but all together make a memorable group of idiots. The action isn't real well done but is negated by the absolutely laugh out loud writing. There are lots of jiggly boobies for all the fan boys but also a lot of jokes concerning both American and Japanese culture.

It's a fun ride that a fan of comedy anime may want to take if he or she hasn't already. I found it to be more entertaining then it should be, but loved it all the more for that.

I'm giving Baka and Test a 7.5/10"
1081,1.0,So I watched this movie last week and I was looking forward to it. I could NOT keep track of all the freaking characters there was way too many for a movie where you rarely can see their faces and mostly see the uniform their wearing which are all the exact same. And I just couldn't get into it. So I turned it off forty minutes into it.
1082,5.0,"I loved this movie. It was scary. You never know what's in the water with you. This movie proves it. Just so you know, an actual shark only eats a baby seal ever three days or so, remember this when you're freaking out during the movie. Very suspenseful and I lov the accents,,"
1083,5.0,Great movie and very insightful. Plus the main theme song freaking rocks.
1084,3.0,"""Our Idiot Brother"" has some really funny people in it, and there are some really great moments, but overall it's a story that falls kind of flat. I felt it relied way too much on drastic overuse of the f-word. Seriously, it was everywhere, and I am personally one of the word's biggest fans. But here, it was just too much.

Paul Rudd plays this guy who really nice and sweet, and he's got these three sisters who are pretty self-absorbed, superior, and selfish. They look down on him, and on their mom, who is similiar to him (their dad must have really sucked). He gets into a bit of legal trouble, he gets dumped by his girlfriend, he goes to live with each sis in turns. He messes up! Big time! Oh no!

You see where this is going, I hope. Because it's very VERY obvious. You'll probably be entertained for a little while, but this isn't the best movie you'll see all year. Rashida Jones and TJ Miller are in it, which is awesome, because TJ Miller is freaking awesome. He actually plays almost the exact same character that Paul Rudd is playing, and they are really sweet guys. Steve Coogan is also in it (but not nearly enough for my liking), playing Emily Mortimer's character's husband, with a fantastic line regarding her body.

It's not a terrible movie, but it's not a great one. It's firmly entrenched in the middle."
1085,2.0,"This could've almost been 3 stars if it wasn't for the laziness of the script. It was a ""Cheesy but Funny"" concept that could've almost work for me; lots of blood, lots of action and suspense, interesting cast...But the way the script was written made some of the scenes a bit illogical. Now i know what you must be thinking : A movie where a man with a chainsaw is dressed as a bunny is not very logic anyway. That's true. But they could've at least made it a funny ride for the viewers.....

The main problem is the lack of decision and initiative from the characters. The opening scene on the road for example, where the main cast is being followed and harassed by the bunny man in his truck is way too long....they don't know what to do! they all look so desperate but no one speaks, no one has an idea or a solution ! They stop the car because they're too scared of being followed and bump in but then: Nothing! They're all freaking out in the car on the side of the road for what seems like an hour, not knowing what to do! Again, no initiative, no ideas, not even a cell phone....Nothing!

The movie does get a little better after the first 30 min....Once they finally realise they're being chased by a freak with a chainsaw dressed  as a bunny things do get a little more interesting and funnier but then again, the lack of initiative from the cast remains a little annoying sometimes. I mean c'mon, you guys are like 5 healthy individuals and this freak is alone, AND dressed as a rabbit...lol......At least we get a few interesting bloody scenes and some action (after the first 30 min of course....) The guy playing the bunny is good, he's a funny freak. The cinematography is also very good, nice picture quality.

A few minor changes would've made this film another hit in the ""Best worst movie ever"" tradition. I still had a good time watching it, but I'm aware those type of movies are not for everyone. Give it a try if you want to have some good laughs with your friends but don't expect to be blown away....

NOW RUN!!!!!"

I did like the countdown but there were some things I thought could have been left out and some things I thought should have been in the countdown.  Like I said though, u can't please everybody.  The countdown begins with Hulk Hogan seeing double against Andre the Giant at The Main Event when Hogan lost the title and the twin refs show up.  Pretty good angle.  Afterwards we get the Nexus invading, Big Show chokeslamming Taker thru the ring on Raw, the backlot brawl at wm 12 which I feel didn't belong, the snake in the present box at Macho Man and Elizabeth's wedding reception courtesy of Jake Roberts, John Cena lifting both Big Show and Edge up on his back at Wrestlemania 25, the stupid concrete crypt match at Great American Bash 2004 where Taker buried Paul Bearer in concrete, DX invading WCW, the New Age Outlaws putting Terry Funk and Catcus Jack in a dumpster and pushing them off the stage, Triple H and the escalator, Mr McMahon introducing us to new GM Eric Bischoff, in a very tasteless spot we see Tim White committing ""suicide"", Randy Orton being dumped on thumbtacks at Backlash 2004, the unholy wedding with Taker and Stephanie McMahon, Shawn Michaels and Diesel using Mad Dog Vachon's artifical leg at In Your House, Haiti Kid getts his hair cut, Vince McMahon gets attacked by Austin in the hospital, Jeff Jarrett cracking Fabulous Moolah over the head with his guitar, Edge cashing in his Money in the Bank against John Cena, Kurt Angle spraying WCW and ECW with milk, the McMahon kiss my ass club, Jeff Hardy pyro malfunction, Austin blowing up the DX bus, Triple H's wedding to Stephanie in Vegas, another tasteless spot with Snitsky punting a ""baby"", the spot where Austin dumps concrete in Vince's corvette, the cobra biting Macho Man, Shane McMahon's fall at Summerslam 2000, The Rockers break up on the Barber Shop, Edge spearing Jeff Hardy off the ladder at Wrestlemania 17, Kane setting JR on fire, Austin stuns McMahon, Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon's street fight at King of the Ring 2001, Jeff Hardy's swanton off the Titan Tron, Edge spearing Mick Foley through a burning table at Wrestlemania 22, Austin arrives on a Zamboni, Roddy Piper hitting Jimmy Snuka with a coconut, WWE buying WCW, Mae Young getting powerbombed off the stage, Big Show's daddy's funeral, the infamous Montreal Screwjob, Big Show and Brock Lesnar break ring, when Tyson and Austin met, Vince McMahon's limo blows up after Mr McMahon's appreciation day, Sable's ""binkini"" at Fully Loaded 1998, Jimmy Snuka's dive off the cage on Don Muraco, the spot with Brian Pillman pulling the gun on Steve Austin, when Austin gives the Corporation a beer bath and finally Mick Foley and the Undertaker's Hell in a Cell match at King of the Ring.  Pretty good countdown but could have been better.  Disc 2 and 3 had matches and moments.  The moments from disc 2 are:  Piper giving Haiti Kid a haircut which is more funny then an OMG moment.  I don't think one deserves to be on here.  Jake Roberts turning the cobra loose on Macho Man and having him bite Macho is freaking good.  I remember seeing this as a kid and just being scared to death for Macho.  This is a great choice.  When the Rockers split is next and was very good as well.  It was kind of dark for the WWE in those days and that's why I liked it.  You get the full segment when Austin stuns McMahon and this is a great one as well to include.  Up next is when Austin arrives to the ring in a Zamboni and then leaps over the top rope and onto Vince.  Great moment.  Then we get another classic where Austin comes to the ring in a beer truck to confront Vince, Shane and Rock and proceeds to give them a beer bath.  Awesome moment.  Lastly of the moments is the funeral for Big Show's father on Smackdown and this was just stupid.  I did like the matches from Disc 2.  The first one was Shawn Michaels vs Diesel for the WWE title in a No Holds Barred match at In Your House.  Great match with some very good spots although I did think that the use of Mad Dog Vachon's leg was pushing it just a bit.  The next match is when Triple H took on the Undertaker at Shotgun Saturday Night and this one isn't that great so really don't waste your time.  The next match is one that has been released all the time:  The Hell in a Cell match with Mick Foley and Undertaker at King of the Ring 1998.  I've discussed this match on other DVD reviews and will not do it again.  It's a good match and if you haven t seen it yet then where have u been?  Lastly, on disc 2 we get the Hardcore title match with Steve Blackman and Shane McMahon at Summerslam 2000.  This is a pretty good match and may very well be the only time we get to see Blackman on a DVD set.  I think really though the only reason to watch is the fall from Shane.  Disc 3's moments are:  Kurt Angle spraying milk all over the WCW/ECW regime which is kind of a copy of the beer bath but it was still cool, when Austin and Booker T brawled at the grocery store which is kind of dumb, the highlight reel with Trish and Lita is ok, the whole Mr McMahon appreciate night which is ok and some Jerry Lawler outtakes.  The matches are good as we begin with the TLC II match at Wrestlemania 17.  Great match lots of high spots and just all around good fun.  It's easy to see how this match did win Match of the Year.  We also get the Kurt Angle/Shane McMahon street fight from King of the Ring 2001.  This match is like a movie as it builds and builds and builds to one awesome conclusion.  As a side note, just think to yourself:  How is Shane McMahon still alive? after seeing this one.  We get the Brock Lesnar vs Big Show match from Smackdown in 2003.  Really this match is ok but the only reason to watch is when the ring explodes under the weight of these two.  You do get the Concrete Crypt match with Undertaker taking on both Dudley's.  Stupid concept and even dumber match.  We also get to see Edge cashing in his MitB briefcase against John Cena at New Year's Revolution in a great 20 second match.  Waste of time.  Lastly, we get the WM 22 match with Edge and Mick Foley going at it.  Fantastic way to end the DVD set and just a really good match from both.  Again a pretty good DVD set that could have been better.  Some things I would have liked to have seen is:  Sgt Slaughter whipping Bob Backlund, Ricky Steamboat getting his throat squashed by Macho Man and the Ring Bell, the dozen chairshots taken by Mick Foley at Royal Rumble 1999, Steve Austin being hit by the car at Survivor Series 1999, how about when Kane unmasked, the story with Mark Henry and the transvestite, the Kat exposing her puppies for everyone at Armaggedon 1999, when Earthquake sat on and killed Damien in front of Jake Roberts, the breaking of kayfabe in MSG with the Clique, that kick to Shawn Michaels's head by Owen Hart on Raw, what about Owen's death (to me what should have been number 1 but didn't even make the list), Mae Young giving birth to a hand, Val Venis getting his u know what choppy chopped by Kaientai, when Rick Martel blinded Jake Roberts, that shooting star from Brock Lesnar at Wrestlemania 19, ECW invading WWE in 1997 and when the Undertaker put the Ultimate Warrior inside a coffin and left him there.  These are just things I would have liked to have seen on the list.  Like I said you can't please us all."
1090,5.0,Much better movie than I expected. Tom hardy is a freaking animal
1091,5.0,freaking awesome...wish these guys would do  more movies
1092,4.0,"I initially watched this for a shallow reason (hot Viking guy - hey I'm a woman who likes looking at men, sue me ;-p
But I stuck with it because it was so interesting and beautifully shot.  I also liked that I had no idea where this film was going to take me.  It was a journey into a past that was violent, cold and brutal and where a wrong choice could kill you.  People often make comments about how they would like to go back in time without considering what a dirty, hungry and freaking cold existence it was.  This film really reminded me about how much modern life has softened us.  I also found the main character complicated (actually l find most men complicated!).  He was a caged and chained slave forced to repeatedly fight to the death for the amusement of his owner.  Yet he wasn't needlessly cruel - he did what he had to do to survive.  But I think all that death ate at his humanity - leading him to make the choices he did.  This film made me think, like really good films do - I recommend it."
1093,2.0,"First of all, I have to say that I personally enjoyed most of the film.  However, I cant recommend this film to most people.  I enjoyed it because it was ""free"", included as an Amazon Prime Free Streaming video.

This film tells the story of a group of 5 twenty-something friends that go away for a weekend to celebrate one of the friends 21st birthday.  They leave NYC and take a road trip to the winter home of the birthday girl's aunt.  An unseen ""guy in a van"" starts messing with them, tailing them, following them, beeping at them, that sort of thing, and everyone automatically freaks out dramatically.  The guy in the van leaves them alone eventually, and they continue on their way.  Of course, creepy things start to happen in the usual horror film fashion.

I cannot recommend this film.  It is a slow build, a very, very slow build, and most of the film is an attempt at tension, atmosphere and setup.  I actually really enjoy atmosphere, tension and all that spookiness, so I didn't mind this. However, there just wasn't any payoff for the tense scenes. There is a lot of teasing with no reward given.  There are not even a lot of good jump scares, the signature funhouse move of all horror films.  The end of the film, though finally delivering on action, was just a shaky, disorienting mess. I felt like the film makers were taking advantage of the found footage genre as a cover for a complete lack of planning.  I felt like they said, Ok, theres not really a script for this part, and the budget is completely flat, sooo just start running, screaming bloody murder and PLEASE shake and twirl the camera around as much as possible.  That should do it.

The characters also spook and panic waay more easily than is actually believable.  Things that in normal, fully functional adults would trigger simple annoyance or curiosity result in outright panic and freaking out for no real reason.  I mean, these are young adults from the one of the largest metropolises in the world, right?  They've seen it all...and yet they're basically afraid of their own shadow??  I've been to NYC about 5 or 6 times, and it's chock-full of angry, aggressive vans, usually white and often windowless.  A more believable reaction from world-wise urban kids would be to arrogantly flick off ""van guy"" and joke about it...at least at first, anyway.

So why did I enjoy this film?  Number one, I enjoy horror films and have an open mind for different levels of budget and amateur skill.  Though this one fell short of its aim, I enjoyed the journey.  The actors did a good job with sometimes unrealistic dialogue and character actions, especially Laurel Casillo (Cassy). The first act or two showed possibility, and then it went downhill from there.  Secondly, the plot hit a personal  happy nerve with me!  Once or twice every winter, I and - yep - four friends pile into a truck - two in the front, three in the back -  and drive north for several hours to a friends family winter home for a long weekend of skiing, laying around and LOTS of drinking.  Once we leave the highway, the roads get snowy, rural and twisty.  When we get there, the house is dark and freezing, we have to find the key, turn on the heat, and then we light a fire, sit around and start drinking.  HA!  The kids in the film could be us minus the whole psycho killer/boogeyman thing.  I would like us to watch it on the next trip, but since I apparently am the only one who can find enjoyment in bad scary movies, I would be the only one liking it!

So I enjoyed this, but it's not a well-made film, and I feel like I may be one of the very few who doesn't think it's a total waste.  It needs much more action and it just really comes off the rails in the last act.  I want to personally give it 3 stars, but I don't want anyone who reads my 3-star review to think that it's ok to pay for.  It's just...not.

If you are still curious, please check it out for free."
1094,1.0,"This movie is TERRIBLE! IT has NO plot. What you read above is all there is (only worse.)

The ""crazed"" stalker is just someone who honked at their car and passed them, only later to be found stopped ahead for whatever reason. That is the movies crazed stalker. They get freaked out when they see the van in a -- hold your breath kids -- gas station filling up on gas. Wow. That has the thumb print of Satan all over it, right?

The guy has this impossibly big camera. It's somewhat smaller than the ones they use nowadays. It was the kind you have to put on your shoulder and he seemingly carried it everywhere. That must be some very strong battery (and arm muscles.)

These kids are the only kids who can get lost outside after a snow storm. They were all freaking out about ""being lost"". It wasn't snowing nor was there a wind. The camera guy panned around to show evidence of animal tracks but the snow was largely untouched (and the animal tracks couldn't have been made by an animal larger than a cat.) I wanted to say, FFS! Turn around, look down, and follow your tracks. Then again we wouldn't get award winning lines like ""is that... AN ANIMAL?!"" They're in a foresty area. One of the guys says ""what? An ANIMAL?! Here? In the WOODS?! NEVER!""

The tension goes up when the poor, haunted kids get a two crank calls and a pounding at the door. After the prerequisite screaming, tears and OMIGAHS!, one goes out to see a present was left. Was it a dead animal? Nope. A poor, mutilated doll that said ""your next""? Nah. Satanic symbols painted on the porch with obviously fake blood? Uh uh. It was a video tape. Do our heros A) call the cops? B) Get the hell out of dodge? C) get some weapons to protect themselves? or D) watch the movie?

I think the fact that they had whoever this thing way was filming them because they probably thought halfway through the movie that having the main video guy holding the camera would seem... I don't don't. I little unreal. ;P I don't know why, though. We learn nothing. The guy tells one of the girls to hold his camera and to make certain she gets a shot of whoever that person is, but we never see it.

We never see why this person was after them too. I have a very hard time believe that because someone honked twice behind you, sped up and passed you, than you seeing him at the side of the road warrants some psycho insane stalker thing.

You don't see anything that happens to the kids. The cover is the face one of the girls makes. We don't see why or what happens afterward. My face was stuck in that position after I finished this movie (the HORROR! HORROR!) It still is, which was awkward at work last night.

For some reason they tacked on 10 minutes of random shots of central park in the fall. There is no given reason for this, but honestly I wasn't surprised. They probably said ""WTF. If they've watched it this far than they've earned it."" That was almost funny too. I mean, it was all random people until the camera man saw a couple actors being filmed than focused entirely on them.

Queue the credits (in which we see the ""scary"" video we just watched 20 mins ago.) This goes on longer than the credits. Some minutes after the credits are done we see a ""no animals were harmed in the making of this film"" (there were no animals seen in the movie) and then a random mishmash of nursery rhymes that they tried to make vaguely scary but failed.

AVOID THIS MOVIE! Though it may prove to be an interesting drinking game."
1095,5.0,Funniest freaking show since Seinfeld!!
1096,3.0,"I want you to understand that Season 4 is still very good and better than average junk on TV. Yet, I would do you a disservice if I did not tell you that Season 4 was not as good as seasons 1-3. Season 1 & 2 are works of art. Season 3 is an excellent forgery. Season 4 guts many of the relationships we spent seasons 1 through 3 making and then tries to piece them back together again. Season 5 jumps the shark(still better than average TV)...but seriously it jumps the freaking shark."
1097,5.0,Community freaking rocks!!!!!
1098,4.0,"Oh, okay, maybe I should give the season 5 stars -- after all, I do still love ""The Good Wife."" However, there's a lot going on this season that I find annoying. First off, Millennials should be offended by how they're being portrayed on this show. It seems that all the new characters are 20- or 30-something, and they're all 1) preposterously gorgeous with perfect bodies; 2) glib, jaded, snarky and humorless (especially if they work for the State Attorney's Office).They also treat sex like something you do when you're bored. Where's the heart in these characters? And if Cary Agos doesn't wipe that squinting-eyed smirk off his face I'm going to slap him with a lawsuit for intentional inflection of emotional distress.

Also: Why is the whole world against Alicia Florrick? Currently:  Her ex mother-in-law is snooping through her apartment, trying to get the goods on her; her former colleague (via her ex-husband) is trying to find a way to bring down her entire law firm in general and her boss-boyfriend in particular; and a new, young, blonde associate (didn't she used to date Don Draper?) is leaving drool-spots all over Lockhart Gardner's expensive Berber carpets as she schemes to swipe Will away from Alicia before the next commercial break. Not only that, but Diane Lockhart is staring at her creepily through the glass walls because she suspects that Alicia and Will are violating the firm's sexual harassment policy. And oh yes, her best friend slept with her husband. And her kids are giving her the Third Degree about how she spends her time when they're at their dad's, as if she's not allowed to date. I'm starting to worry for Our Heroine. Can't the writers bring in Lisa Kudrow to play Alicia Florrick's therapist? I really think she needs one at this point.

Trying as all this is on my nervous system, there's still much gold to be mined this season: seeing big stars in small roles (not quite cameos, but almost) has always been part of TGW's fun, and so far we've had Harvey Fierstein, Parker Posey and Bob freaking Balaban! I'm waiting to tune in one day and see Richard Dreyfuss as a sitting judge. Wouldn't he be perfect in black robes?"
1099,1.0,"This is only the second movie in my 52 years I've walked out on, and that was because my 11 year old son said he was bored. The simple fact is, so was I, so we left. We walked. On a $50 freaking movie bill, we walked.

I wanted to give it another chance, but, guess what, it is still dull and boring. I've forced my way through 40 minutes, and just can't handle watching more. The characters, we don't care about. The situations, overdone. In fact, my feeling is, they were trying just too hard . They had some awfully big shoes to fill, and they were just trying too hard to do it. The pacing was just way too slow, but more than that I just couldn't really empathize with the characters. When you care about the characters, the pacing takes a back seat. It just seemed to go on and on about how magic stuff works -- but we already knew that. It needed to not be some kind of thing that needed to be emphasized, a focus on character and faster pacing would have helped. I mean, for one example, is it really necessary to show dishes flying into place on a table? In a rather prolonged sequence? Haven't we all seen this before? Show it happening, sure... 10 seconds worth would be enough though. Maybe the muggle, or ""nomag"" or whatever, was awed by it -- I wasn't. And even that guy, good grief, just seemed to accept it all without questioning. I mean, OK. Just a few minutes later, your roommate for the night jumps down a bag. Do you wonder what the Hell is going on? No, obviously, you just follow him down. And get a ""joke"", and a poor one, in about his girth. Didn't fat jokes go out of style some time ago? Or does that only apply to women?

I think the main problem is that the main protagonists are way, way too passive. Newt is passive to the point of almost apathy. That could be played on as a man out of his own element (England v. US), but it never really was. Even the main lady just takes a load of crap, never even expresses how that makes her feel... if this is all leading up to some sort of boiling point, I'm sorry; the writers screwed up. You don't make your audience wait through an hour or more of BS to get there. And again, Newt is so passive as to be unlikable; not good. Or for at least the first 40 minutes, the ""star"" kind of just gets led around by others, not really doing a damn thing. Is that really how Englishmen are? I've met a few. Not in my experience. In fact, Englishmen are very direct, in most cases, where us yanks would not be. This stereotype of the ""proper English Gentleman"" can be taken just so far before it becomes tedious -- unless you're playing it for laughs (Monty Python anyone?). Real people are not like that, even in England. Or at least, I certainly hope not and believe not. And for heaven's sakes, this was mainly made by Englishmen.

All in all, I just simply can't recommend this. I am truly, truly sorry. I very much wanted this to be ""the new Harry Potter"". It just isn't, plain and simple. I didn't want it to be like this, it's just how it turned out. Attack me if you must, but I do ask that any response be reasonable and salient and address the basic issues. I don't need, and won't respond, to personal attacks."
1100,4.0,"A TV show from the self-described ""biggest producers of garbage on the planet""? On DVD? Yep.

MAD premiered on Cartoon Network last year to mixed reactions. The younger folk seem to like it well enough, the snooty late-teens and nostalgic twenty-somethings turn up their noses, and the older folk just scratch their heads and say ""MAD magazine is still around? Huh."" In a nutshell, I would dare to describe it as ""Robot Chicken for a PG audience"". Animated sketch comedy that parodies and mashes up every facet of pop culture that might be relevant to today's cartoon-watching crowd.

And in my opinion, it works. What we're presented with here is a high-octane stream of movie riffs, kids' cartoon parodies, Internet memes, gross-out jokes, and quirky little bumps between segments (some of which are produced by the legendary Sergio Aragones himself!). The mash-ups range from up-to-date (CSiCarly, Avaturd, I Love You Iron Man, etc) to cross-generational (2012 Dalmatians, Malcolm In The Middle-Earth, Grey's In Anime, etc), and cover dozens of sub-genres in between.

If you remember reading MAD magazine as a kid (and haven't been keeping up with what kids are reading and watching these days) you may be ""too old"" to get this show. Some things will still make you chuckle, but unless you're familiar with Hannah Montana, Twilight, and Justin freaking Bieber, you'll miss at least 50% of the jokes present here. Though you'll probably still enjoy the Spy vs Spy shorts. Classic stuff.

For a DVD release, this works well enough. Half of the show's first season (13 11-minute segments) is present, picture and audio are fine, but no special features. And interestingly enough, no advertisements. Still, I'm docking a star for releasing the season in two $eparate part$, and for the lack of special features - some interviews with the snarkastic writers would have been nice.

All in all though, pick this up if you're a fan of the show. If your kids are always trying to take a peek at your Robot Chicken DVDs even after you've told them not to, give them this to suck on. Who knows, it could work.

Don't get even, get MAD."
1101,3.0,"It's the typical ""Young people go somewhere to party and s*** goes down"" slasher. The characters and overtly perverse killings make it fun, though. We also get a new slasher movie icon, a guy who uses a freaking anvil on a pole as a sledgehammer."
1102,1.0,"I must admit I'm not a giant comic book fan and the comics I do read are more DC then Marvel but I do enjoy the Marvel movies and cartoons. After seeing the Thor movie I wanted to know more about Thor and Loki's relationship and ""Blood Brothers"" seemed like the perfect way to do it. I watched it with my father who only has a slightly higher opinion of this movie then I do and my opinion is that it was horrible. I couldn't stand the style of the moving comics, and the plot was horrible. The whole movie Loki is gloating, reflecting or tormenting himself but it's all a bunch of talking. NOTHING HAPPENS! And besides glimpses of Thor we never see him and at the end you wish he had stayed out of the movie for freaking five more minutes so there MIGHT have been a decent ending to a miserable story. I didn't even like the set up of it being episodes, it would have been better to have it be a movie so you weren't constantly interrupted by the scene of Thor and Loki about to fight which was the only good looking scene to begin with. I would barely recommend this to hardcore fans and I recommend avoiding it to anyone simply curious."
1103,5.0,"This was another good PPV from the WWE that featured some of the best matches seen all year.  The opening match was a 6 man tag with Rey Mysterio, John Morrison and Kofi Kingston taking on Alberto del Rio, The Miz and R-Truth.  This was treated as a almost forgotten match with guys who weren't even supposed to be on the show.  I really thought that because of the way they were playing that angle that all 6 men would come out and put on a hell of match but they really didn't.  It was good but just didn't have that wow factor that you look for.  Up next was Sheamus vs Mark Henry.  Some people that I know hated this match but I thought it was pretty good.  There was a lot of high impact moves and the ending with Henry slamming Sheamus through the barricade at ringside was just fantastic.  Still don't understand this whole push for Henry (maybe it's a prize for him putting in over 15 years of service, I don't know).  The next match was Kelly Kelly taking on Beth Pheonix for the Diva's title.  This match was really good and we actually get to see a side of Kelly that we really never see and that s the angry side of her.  Other then that this match was just your standard Divas match (oh how I long for better womens matches).  I'll be honest if the next match would have maybe ran for 20 plus minutes it may have been the match of the night.  Daniel Bryan and Wade Barrett put on a hell of a contest for over 12 mins.  I really thought that because Bryan just won the MitB ladder match I thought they would keep him strong but again I was wrong as Barrett beats Bryan and actually makes himself look stronger even though he's not really a contender for the world title at this point and Bryan is.  I just don't understand why the WWE treats Bryan like a weakling.  They really need to watch him ROH or Japan because Bryan has taken on and beaten the best in the world.  Hopefully they'll wake up soon.  Up next was the No Holds Barred match for the world heavyweight title between Christian and Randy Orton.  Hard hitting match from start to finish.  This match was freaking good and maybe the best that they had in their feud.  They used everything from tables to chairs to kendo sticks to the steel steps, nothing was left untouched.  When it was over Orton was champion again for the 9th time and I was happy.  The main event was for the Undisputed WWE championship as John Cena who just recently won the title was taking on CM Punk who claimed he was the real champion and was returning to prove it.  Triple H who was the COO wanted to be sure this one was called down the middle and so he named himself special referee.  Many didn't think this match would live up to the MitB match they had and it didn't but it was still a very very good match.  It wasn't as long as their previous match but it still had a lot of back and forth action and a lot of near falls.  Punk would beat Cena again (I can't really remember the last time Cena lost at 2 back to back PPV's) and the crowd was once again primed and excited to see this.  After that the card gets kind of weird as Kevin Nash comes back and powerbombs Punk and then del Rio comes out to cash in his MitB and beat Punk to now become the champion.  I do feel this is bad booking as Punk is the most popular superstar you have and you should try to keep the title on Punk for a while and keep the fans just wondering when del Rio is going to cash in.  I think the WWE moved too fast on this but it was still a great show from top to bottom and in my opinion one of the best Summerslams in recent memory, definatly better then last year.  Great matches and another great PPV."
1104,5.0,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister who is in love with everything Christmas and if it were up to her, it would be Christmas every freaking day. She loved it. And it's a great price for all three."
1105,5.0,"The Silent House (aka La Casa Muda) is an intense, (seemingly) simple story about a girl and her father hired by a friend of the family, to go out to a dilipidated, boarded-up house in the country and spend the weekend getting the place cleaned up and in reasonably good condition for sale.  Once there, they find themselves the victims of a terror within the house.

Filmed in one continuous shot (and for a grand total of six thousand dollars), the 'one continuous shot' angle serves as more than an interesting novely or a way to actually make a good movie on such a tight budget: it puts the happenings one hundred per cent in real time and narrows the entirety of the movie into a very tight, intense focus.  It's not a 'found-footage' movie (although it does share a lot of the atmosphere and characteristics of the best of that sub-genre), but the camera does stay on the girl and her immediate surroundings for at least 90% of the time, roaming away only for a few key moments.  In this way it remains very much a point-of-view film.

This is one that requires close attention and, preferably, multiple viewings.  Some very interesting things happened watching this movie.  On my first viewing, a lot of things that were going on, especially with the way the characters acted, didn't seem to be making much sense until the end when things started falling into place and I thought I had it pretty much figured out.  As the movie finishes, one is left not only shaken but wondering if they pieced things togther right and, as with other mindbenders like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sixth-Sense-Collector-s-Edition-Series/dp/B00004BZIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Forest/dp/B000ARXG68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider Forest</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shutter-Island/dp/B001GCUO5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shutter Island</a>, you're left wanting to watch it again.

On the second viewing is where it got weird.  Watching closely you may see that certain assumptions from the first watch don't really play out or make sense anymore.  Some of the explanations didn't seem to fit as much.  Here's the strangest part, and something I don't remember ever happeening to quite the same effect with any other movie: as logic breaks down more and more, the movie abruptly gets scarier and scarier.  It's like there's something the conscious mind isn't quite picking up on, but is freaking the hell out of the subconscious.  Not that it wasn't already disturbing and frightening, but this whole 'subconscious freak-out' thing really pushed it over the top.  I've talked to several people who've seen this who generally get different interpretations of things in here, both from me and from each other.  It's possible there simply is no 'tipping point' where everything clicks in and makes sense (like with The Sixth Sense) but there's definately something weird going on.

I do generally love 'open-to-interpretation' movies with ambiguous endings, but often times This Much ambiguosness might be overkill.  With The Silent House it jusy makes it tremendously creepy and haunting.  A great movie, and a great entry for Uruguay onto the international horror scene (they've done a couple of horror movies before, but I don't think any of them got much of a release outside their own backyard; I know I hhaven't managed to see them).

Fright fans have got to get The Silent House."
1106,5.0,"just absolutely freaking hilarious, entertainment from start to finish."
1107,5.0,"I watched this with 3 guys who were die-hard action movie guys, and they LOVED this movie.  Halfway through, one of the guys said, ""this is NOT a chick flick""!!  Its the funniest freaking movie Ive seen since The Hangover.  Highly recommend it!"
1108,5.0,This is so freaking funny. I didn't watch it for the longest time because I heard it was raunchy. It is definitely not. It's hilarious!!!
1109,5.0,"I'm on vacation. I'm minding my own business and BAM!!! I turned on HBO for ""noise"" while my hubby got ready for bed. Now here we are, in a hotel filled with sleeping people at 2:00 in the freaking morning and we are laughing so hard we're crying! They've called the room to ask us to be quiet! Of course that caused another round of hysterical laughter! We have decided to order a copy of this movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bridesmaids/dp/B00466HN7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bridesmaids</a>for all of our children (we're in our 50's so I guess that blew the demographics on this one) with a box filled with memories and love. What a great way to start this vacation....me, my hubby laughing our butts off! This is a great film and I hope you enjoy it as much as we have."
1110,2.0,"The film starts with a bang, as unknown perpetrators invade a hospital and steal a new born baby from the nursery. From there, the movie fast forwards a couple of decades to the home of a young couple in the midst of throwing a shindig. The party proves to be a success. That is, until three young men on the lamb, due to a foiled bank heist, head there because it used to be their home. The men enter the home and chaos ensues. To make matters worse, one of the brothers is severely wounded. Apparently their Momma lost the house and they had no way of contacting her because her son lost his phone. Yep... you read it correctly. The boys had been sending her cash for a very long time and she wasn't there to collect it (they couldn't write her a letter that they had lost said phone). So now, they want to know where the money went. This family is very good at losing things: their minds, home, phone and cash.

I'm not going to delve further into the story. The plot is ridiculous, a hackneyed script the relies too heavily on the motherly instinct gone awry premise. The characters are either selfish or boorishly stupid. Some of the errors in judgement are astronomically bad. Their is no subtlety in the human error, which gives the bad guys the upper hand. The movie takes unnecessary turns to prolong a story that should have finished upon Rebecca De Mornay's entrance and inquiry about the missing cash. The plot twist, or reason why it was prolonged is just plain silly. All the gore in the world is not going to save this film.

Acting wasn't atrocious, but it wasn't great either. Rebecca De Mornay over stays her welcome as the psychotic mother who is frosting a cake one minute and then citing proverbial quotes like ""no use crying over spilled milk,"" as a captive lies dead and bleeding on the floor.

The gore wasn't bad, if that's your thing. The body count runs high and some of the deaths are creative. Fans of splatterpunk and gorror should find something here to get their neurons spitting happy thoughts.

*sorta kinda spoiler, but not really*
MOTHER'S DAY enraged me, especially the end. I can't cite all of the reasons the end nearly brought me to ""Hulk Smash Mode"" without spoliers, so I'll leave it be. All that I can say is that this homicidal, dysfunctional family drives along the highway of palatial circumstances, in a gigantic freaking SUV that law enforcement never seemed to have noticed."
1111,4.0,"I saw this movie back in 2012 and have been itching to see it for the last couple of weeks for some dramatic insight on the whole Ebola issue going on in Africa that has recently poked it's way into the United States. Overall, It was a pretty good movie and a great choice of cast. Although at times it seemed like everyone was chillin' and not freaking about about this deadly disease but rather sitting in meeting being rude to one another, Weird but Good."
1112,5.0,"Season 2 is just as funny as the first season. Alex and Dave finally put aside their animosity towards each other (and in one episode, they even hook up). Brad and Jane go through the trials and tribulations of marriage. Penny is slightly more mature. Her hippie mother makes a cameo (Megan Mullally from Will and Grace and Parks and Recreation. She is so freaking hilarious). Max and Dave have a Mutt and Jeff relationship. The funniest episode of the season was definitely the Valentines episode.

I seriously don't know why they cancelled this show. Was it because there was an interracial couple? Or is it because people simply don't watch scripted comedies anymore?"
1113,5.0,"Most of us have heard of the ""frivolous"" McDonalds coffee lawsuit which netted a woman almost three million dollars. After viewing this documentary, not only do you see the suit was about as far away from frivolous as you could get, but it started a smear campaign to put people in a mind set to poo-poo any other such case.

Here's the scoop. This documentary begins with the infamous McDonalds/Liebeck case where the 89 year old woman spilled hot coffee on herself and sued McDonalds for a king's ransom. It goes into the details of the case, then goes on to show the movement in the country on making things such so the average citizen cannot get their day in court no matter how negligent the other party might be.

This is a freaking horror show. The case shows the true negligence of McDonalds over and over again in regard to their coffee. It then goes to show how Carl Rove and others funnel millions of dollars into state supreme court judge elections to insure getting industry friendly judges who will vote in TORT reform to limit the liability of business in law suits. Then there's Arbitration. Turns out your credit card, cell phone or even employment contracts might prevent you from suing them for whatever reason. Instead you'd have to go to arbitration which favors those being sued about 90% of the time. Like those odds???? This is pretty much the classic approach to a documentary. They open with the key story and interject with talking heads from various folk to give the viewer at least somewhat a balanced view of things. The bad guys here do look like bad guys but maybe that couldn't be helped.

This is a real eye opener. Everyone needs to see this to make certain their legislators are fighting the good fight so we are insured of having our day in court."
1114,1.0,"Disclaimer: I am a diehard Tolkien fan, and I loved the first three LOTR movies that Peter Jackson made, despite the mostly understandable changes he included.

For all those who say that Jackson has made a new version of The Hobbit that we can now appreciate alongside the book, shut the heck up. The amount this story was changed to make a new version of The Hobbit for people to like is equivalent to fan fiction at best and horrific corruption of the story at worst. Its as if I wanted to tell a story about the Vietnam war, but Hitler is still alive and there is a foreshadowing 9/11 with not-so-subtle rumors of Bin Laden every 15 minutes. There is not a single significant event in this entire movie that didn't have a big and unnecessary change from the book to the movie.

Oh awful mistakes, how shall I enumerate thee? *SPOILER ALERT* Listed below are things the movie got wrong about adapting the story in the book to the big screen:
The main orc should be dead before the journey began in the first movie; Legolas should not be there; Radagast should not be there; Tauriel should not be there (or anywhere, since her character doesnt exist); Bilbo didn't know about the Arkenstone beforehand; the dwarves were in the Elvish prison for at least a month before Biblo let them out (not just one day); Gandalf did not have any discoveries about Sauron like that in the movie, despite there being rumors of a necromancer and an encounter with him in the North (else Gandalf must have completely forgotten all about Sauron when he hung out with Bilbo later and didn't wonder about the ring very much); the barrels with the dwarves in them had lids and straw and Bilbo rode on top (hence Bilbos nickname Barrelrider, not Barrel-periphery like in this movie); no dwarf was poisoned by an orc blade; there was no need to reference kingsfoil, as if PJ was remaking FoTR; there was no stupid dwarf smuggling situation with Bard at Lake Town; Beorn was a huge, muscular jolly man who only had milk and honey for food and whom they had to approach a few dwarves at a time, not some moping mountain man with a variety of food for everyone whose home they broke into until he transformed from a bear to said moping man; the dwarves did nothing with the spiders because they were drugged up on venom while Bilbo sang and killed all the spiders; there was only one black arrow and it was Bards; there was nothing magic about black arrows per se, the black arrow was simply Bards lucky arrow and he was boss with it; the dwarves were not such jerks to Bilbo by this point; Bilbo was sent in to spy concerning Smaug, not sent to retrieve the Arkenstone, of which he knew nothing; there were no orcs invading Lake Town; Bilbo was not such an idiot about taking off the ring when it would be advantageous to have it on (around a dragon, around spiders, etc); there was no dwarf plan to cover Smaug in molten gold (as if that would work, since hes a freaking dragon and is immune to heat); the dwarves barely saw Smaug (if at all) before he was shot down at Lake Town

All these aside from the blatant overuse of CGI (sometimes really bad CGI), excess use of fight scenes (often ridiculous fight scenes) when no fighting occurred, the overwhelmingly obvious fact that Peter Jackson was making this into another LOTR movie (evidence for that is strewn throughout the movie), and the completely wrong tone of the movie for the story all these force me to give this awful adaptation of a beloved story 1 star. Id give it a 0 if it let me, but perhaps the good actors acting with a wretched script is worth 1 star. Shame on you, Peter Jackson, for ruining this story. It should not bear the name of The Hobbit due to its enormous deviations from the story in all except the ultimate summary, namely that dwarves go after treasure with a hobbit and piss off a dragon guarding the treasure."
1115,5.0,"There isn't much to say about ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" other than... this movie is freaking amazing!!! It lives up to every expectation I had. Peter Jackson is the perfect director for all things Tolkein."
1116,4.0,"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.  His cinematic adventure began last year and continues this year.  Peter Jackson's rationale for stretching out Tolkien's book into a trilogy of nearly three-hour movies has been well-documented by this point.  An Unexpected Journey received mostly weak or middling reviews.  However, Jason, Mother, Father, and I all liked it well enough to look forward to the next movie.  That glimpse of Smaug's eye while he wakes up and peeks out of the pile of coins certainly teased something intense.  A couple of weeks ago, my friend Jason and I went to see it in a theater that is a fair distance away; I only now got around to reposting my impression here.

Let me get this out of the way first.  Yes, we did attend an HFR-3D screening, which is why we traveled to that theater.  How did it look?  Yes, it did look like a sports broadcast or an old BBC drama.  Yes, the smoother motions did sometimes look exaggerated.  Yes, I did need some time to grow accustomed to it.  When I did, however, I found it to look very nice.  The computer-generated creatures, sets, and effects actually look more natural and better-integrated with the live actors and sets.  The overall picture had a brilliant clarity.  If you get used to the higher framerate, you too might find it beneficial to the overall experience, though its understandable if you dont.

And now for the movie itself.  In terms of plot, the movie cant stand on its own, as it is built to be the middle section of a longer storyand it ends on a blatant cliffhanger to boot!  The overall story has a lot going for it, though.  I must disagree with critics who say that the pacing is lethargic; it never felt that way to me and every scene felt like it was directed appropriately. It gives us some intense interactions among characters along with wild action scenes, even if Legolas sometimes looks like an over-the-top super-ninja and some other small elements are also silly.  The cinematography is lush and creative, which seems to have been a trademark of Jacksons from the beginning of his career.  The actors play their parts well, from Martin Freeman as Bilbo to Ian McKellen as Gandalf to Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug.

Soyes.  Jason said this movie was, and I quote, freaking awesome.  I liked it too."
1117,5.0,"Its the freaking Hobbit!!! If you can watch this without reliving your childhood, you weren't raised right.  I saw the dwarves of my childhood as I'd always imagined them.. only they were better looking!! A great rendition of the original story and I'm definitely looking forward to the second and third!!"
1118,5.0,"If, like me, you can't get enough of Tolkien, and if the fine details of of his world interest you as much as the broad story, then you ought to love the Hobbit (Unexpected Journey), which is a microscopic view of the unfolding first third of the tale. It's all done with an obsessive approach to every aspect of the story. Thus, character development is managed with care, but so too are matters like the design of mugs and the hemming on Bilbo's Bermuda sorts. It's all realer-than-real. And that's not a joke. Super high-def technology provides sceen views that work differently from normal human vision. In the real world, we focus with incredible sharpness on a center of interest, and the rest of the visual field is not resolved to that extent; things come into sharpest focus when we look at them. But in the Blu-Ray screen view, the whole wide screen is sharp, and while this is great on the second or eleventh view, because there are always new things to discover, for people who do lots of visual work, the first viewing is freaking weird, antiseptic, and far, far from believable. I don't recommend doing it, because it nearly ruins the movie, but it becomes easy to see the painted, stage-set effects of surface texture, or fabricated and CGI elements in so many scenes. It's gorgeous, and perhaps looks ""real"" to most people, but it sometimes reeks of Jar Jar Binks and the heavy-handed effects in the later Star Wars episodes. The other jarring element of the film, in my opinion, is the decision to treat many of the dwarves as caricatures. There's way too much ""Dopey"" in many of them, in my opinion, and while humor is essential to balance the other emotions of the story, I found this element to be heavy handed, unbelievable, and dumb. On the other hand, the casting and acting of Bilbo is brilliantly done. I highly recommend the film; I just wish the Blu-Ray treatment wasn't so excessive and clinical, and I wish Jackson had avoided the doofus aspects of the dwarves. Well -- one more thing. As with Spielberg's ""Tintin,"" is it really necessary to have endless video-game action sequences? It's like watching NASCAR."
1119,5.0,"These tutorials/workouts are a freaking dream!  I love how they're paced, how they're taught, the locations, the time they take to do each section - they're just amazing.  And the most awesome thing is, it's VERY visually interesting.  You never get bored.

Each episode combines about 4-5 basic moves into a short choreography.  Starting with a warmup and ending with the complete choreography, the amount of time and work is just so apparent in every episode.  There are some really challenging moves that are broken down very nicely.  I would recommend this second season for anyone that's ready to move on from the beginning stages of belly dance.

There are 13 episodes.  Here's the table of contents:

14: Shimmying Circles
15: A Camel in the Cabaret
16: Hops through Flames
17: Slides, Turns, and Layers
18: The Camel's Garden
19: Turns with a Bounce
20: The Camel and the Snake
21: Ethnic Fluidity
22: Turkish Delight
23: Rippling Round
24: Down the Nile
25: Slithering and Circling
26: Bumps, Pops, and Hops

1120,5.0,some of my favorites all in one place! im especially looking forward to bringing them to the cabin on our next camping trip and freaking my friends out. and nobody scares you like mr. price!
1121,5.0,Hi this is John again I know I usually place video game reviews but this dvd set is so freaking hilarious I haven't laughed so hard in years I laughed so much I had trouble catching my breath I was on the fence with buying this collection but when I saw the laurel and hardy movie way out west on tcm I knew I had to own this collection this is at this time the ultimate laurel and hardy collection I love all the shorts and movies on this set I am a devoted stooges fan but I find laurel and hardy funnier than the three stooges I own other dvd sets but this is my absolute favorite this set is the laurel and hardy holy grail of dvds this contains all their best work when I was waiting to receive this from Amazon I watched county hospital on you tube that short in my opinion the funniest of all of them so I urge the hold outs to buy this dvd collection laurel and hardy are the funniest guy's ever if Amazon receives another sweet collection like this with the later shorts and movies I will definitely order it laurel and hardy are worth the price I'm not your traditional fan I'm 32 years old these guys these comic geniuses are before my time but with Amazon's impressive inventory I'm able to own a great piece of history when laurel and hardy died the world suffered a terrible loss but Their work and memory live forever RIP guys you're not forgotten
1122,5.0,I saw part of this show on VH1 tonight. It was part of their Rush Hashanah celebration. It reminded me that Rush is still a freaking awesome band after all these years.  The band was flawless and the crowd was electric. The VH1 telecast lasted 2 1/2 hours. I'm sure the DVD is quite a bit longer than 60 minutes. I will definitely buy this DVD when it is released. Just Moving Pictures from start to finish would be worth the purchase price.
1123,1.0,"Absolutely the dumbest freaking film ever made. It is just plain stoopid. Don't see it, it really, really, really sucks on all fronts. It is freaking dumb, pointless, silly, and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever."
1124,5.0,"I am not sure if one needs to be in the investment industry (as I am), or older and having experience with management, corporate decision making (which I am and have LOL) to fully enjoy the depth of this film. The dialog is outstanding. Very interesting watching upper management only care about the company and themselves. The continued success and ""got mine"" of those in charge, or supplied with wonderful parachute type packages is semi shocking and norm for upper management officers. Our economic disaster of 2008-2010 is presented in its most naked form via this film as to USA corporate banks. They/we bundled mortgage related products with lower ratings B, BB, BBB, A or even C ratings, coupled with a mathmatical formula the said the odds of them all failing was nearly impossible. So the products got AAA ratings by Moodys and S&P !!!!. Then the banking firms sold trillions to each other, who then borrowed trillions from other firms using these AAA rated products as collaterical.. Then the products freaking failed as housing collapased/jobs lost and people could not pay their mortgages!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We damn near destroyed the entire economic world....
Gotta love this film although skirts the true harm of what we did. But presents a fantastic insight into how the corporate profit at all cost world really works; Got Mine, Keep My Job, Make Money, hope I am not fired..... And as you get older (like me), you pray, you can keep your health care benefits LOL..... I watched it twice over a week. A first for me, and even enjoyed it a little more the 2nd time. ""First out the Door, that is not panic"".... Classic line. Really means, you saw the disaster coming first, got out, how can that be panic? LOL...
Cheers
David"
1125,5.0,Totally not what I expected. This movie was freaking hilarious I loved it. It will keep you entertained and laughing all the way to the end.
1126,5.0,"Every now and then someone makes a movie that just totally freaking nails it.  It doesn't try to be anything more than a comedy based on silly horror film standards.  And that is exactly what it is.  Acting is all good enough.  College kid parts aren't suppose to act well .. and they do that well.  Tucker does pretty good with his part, but it isn't about him.  And Dale just freaking nails it.  DERP."
1127,2.0,"After seeing Young Justice Season One Volume One, I was looking forward to catching more of this show. Some of the characterization was off, but I liked the mix of the young superheroes with the Justice League, and this looked like a good chance to explore some corners of the DC Universe that I hadn't seen done in an animated series. (Although where is Wonder Woman? Seriously, why is she not on this show?)

Unfortunately, in Season One Volume Two the show takes a downturn. I don't know how old the writers are, but they can't seem to see teenagers as anything other than petulant brats. For all the mentoring they have received at the hands of older, wiser heroes, the Young Justice group causes more problems than they solve just by their constant whining and temper tantrums.

Kid Flash in particular is poorly handled. Not only can do the writers not seem to understand his powers--he can run really fast but he can't dodge a punch? Since when can a Flash not dodge a punch? --but he is continually stuck in immature, girl-chaser mode. The Kon-El/Superman dynamic is a little more interesting, as Superman doesn't want to take responsibility for this illegal clone struck from his DNA. The two female characters, Miss Martian and Artemis, get to be the least of the ""petulant brat syndrome,"" but they seem to really only be concerned about which boy on the team they are going to hook up with. I thought they were doing something interesting with the last DVD by taking Robin out of the leadership role, but I see know they were just taking turns.

The writers seriously need to change the way they are handling these characters. The rest of the series is so cool. Dr Fate's Tower! Klarion the Witch Boy! Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent going out to a cheap diner for pie! The Red Arrow/Artemis/Green Arrow dynamic! Everything about this series is a lot of fun except for the main characters, and even then only when they are in the spotlight.

Just like Season One Volume One, there are four episodes on this DVD. Each episode seems to be a showcase for a particular character being a spoiled brat. Here is a rundown:

Schooled
Superboy is a big baby. First he refuses Black Canary's training because someone as powerful as he is doesn't need to know how to fight. Then he takes off by himself to battle the escaped Amazo android, putting his friends in jeopardy and generally being a jerk. He learns an important lesson about limits and teamwork.

Infiltrator
Artemis and Red Arrow are a big babies. Green Arrow introduces Artemis as his new prot&eacute;g&eacute;. Red Arrow tries to fight off an evil cloud by himself. Artemis tries to take on the assassin Cheshire by herself. Red Arrow and Artemis learn and important lesson about working together, and the dangers of rivalry.

Denial
Kid Flash is a big baby. There is a break in at Dr. Fate's tower, but Kid Flash doesn't believe in magic. He pretends to believe in magic because Miss Martian does, but that causes all sorts of trouble. Kid Flash leans an important lesson about the power of believing.

Downtime
Aqualad is a big baby. Even though he is hand-picked to be Aquaman's prot&eacute;g&eacute;, he would rather stay behind in Atlantis and moon over Tula. Tula (as anyone who reads comics knows) loves Garth. Aqualad fights some fish monsters, and learns an important lesson about letting go and being happy for your friends instead of being selfish.

The DVD.

Again, four freaking episodes. No bonus features. Total runtime - 90 minutes. Also, there are twenty six episodes in the series and they have released eight so far on two DVDs.  That is a lot of DVDs to buy to get the first season.

This is a terrible, terrible DVD that you should never buy, and you should refuse to support these kinds of cheap business practices from the WB. Vote with your dollar. Wait for the eventual Season One collection."
1128,5.0,"This dvd is TOO much fun to be believed. The fat is trimmed! No blabbing, no wasted time, just hit play and go! Ever wanted to be Britney Spears? I mean, damn, I know I always thought I'd be awesome in my own video. I'm sure you do too.

This workout is like going to the set and shooting your own video. 'Dance a go go' makes you feel like you are doing an entire routine from a Britney Spears video. Sorry to keep saying Britney Spears, but that's what it's like.

It's wicked-fun, for a few reasons...

1) The moves are sexy but not highly complex
2) There's tons of moves!
3) The moves usually repeat four times in a row before changing which gives a great continuity to the dance (meaning: lets you get the physical memory of how it's preformed before they move on)
4) The moves aren't lame or too slow so you get bored, or too fast, so you can't keep up!
5) You do a routine to a whole song, not 45 seconds of it like most 'dance dvds'. And there are three distinctly different routines, and she breaks down the moves, too, if you need that. Honestly, most of them you should be just able to jump right in and dance your bum off too without the breakdown.

It's sexy, hot, fun, FEELS like dancing, is dancing, changes up enough so that you don't feel bored ever, is edgy, rocking, and, again, most importantly DOABLE by any average person.

And don't you look sexy doing it! -- and actually succeeding! You know how too-complex dance dvds are: fun to watch but never get used. This is the opposite of that! You'll definately do this when you want to really dance!

The video stresses your own personal style not freaking out if you're 100% perfect. No problem! Just dance!

MTV, here you come...

Love it, thank you, Andrea! I'm waiting on your visionary part 2~! It's sure to rock!"
1129,4.0,"I originally thought this would just be a standard kid aimed animal film where the good guys (usually led by a kid) overcome some money hungry bad guys to save some whales who have gotten themselves trapped and can't get back to the ocean before the water they are in completely ices over.  I wasn't expecting much, but it's actually quite well done and enjoyable.  I'm not saying there are no annoying characters or anything, Drew Barrymore probably plays the most annoying character she ever portrayed, this time as a Greenpeace volunteer who to say is extremely opinionated about everything and blind (and rude) to learning anything from the opposing side, would be a severe understatement.  I don't know what actually happened in the true story this movie is based on, but Big Miracle includes a ridiculously unbelievable scene where she jumps into freezing cold water and cuts off a shark net caught around a tail of one of the whales with ease and no freaking out at all by the whale.  The point is this is just an out of nowhere scene, it has nothing to do with the story about working out a way to get these three whales to the ocean.  But you can't fault a film overall for that, and that's pretty much the only stupid scene in the whole movie.

Spoilers - I don't know how true the overall tale and ending to the film was but it never really adequately explained why they couldn't just use explosives or something to do the same thing they wanted the Russian ship to do other than some line earlier in the film where Ted Danson's character says we'll apparently be killing off more critters if we do that. But there weren't any other critters where the ship impacted.  The film didn't really give any reasons why these three whales, who you would think should have been aware since you don't see it happening all the time, got themselves in this predicament in the first place. Was there a predator they were fleeing from, were they all trapped in these seemingly in the wrong climate shark nets that they encountered, did aliens drop them there after they were abducted, what? Marine biologists must have come up with some explanation in the decades since it happened and the movie was made that could have been suggested by characters as theories, but none are ever voiced in the film.

But overall it's a good film not where good conquers bad, as there really aren't any villains in this (a few selfish characters, motivated by their own opportunities to gain, but no bad people)."
1130,5.0,great buy and freaking funny loved the sequel. Kevin Hart is super awesome in this movie.
1131,3.0,"I've seen a lot of Exorcism movies. Most of them being VERY bad. The last good one I saw was the Last Exorcism. Well worth watching... well worth owning.

I was hesitant to step into the movie THE DEVIL INSIDE.

Yet... here I went...

I have to say, it was believable... even the ending. I love realism when it comes to horror... which is why The Devil Inside interested me to begin with... also that, and I am addicted to Exorcism movies/articles/documentaries.

Don't go into this expecting Green Pea Soup to be spit everywhere and a lot of gore. Go into this movie expecting to see some things that would FREAK YOU OUT if they happened to you in real life. If you can do that, you'll enjoy this movie. If you can't you might as well skip this one. You have to look at it from a stand point of real life to truly enjoy it. If this happened to you ... it would scare the hell out of you. Not me personally... I am so immune to scary things it's unreal, however, a ""normal"" person would probably have a freaking heart attack.

Now make no mistake about it... the ending SUCKS. But aside from that... the film is tolerable for those of us who like EXORCISM subjects.

For me... The eerie vibe throughout the movie, the realistic effects, the great acting, and the really good story make this for one of the better of the Exorcism movies out there on the market. Not the best though.... could have done a little more, but this is well worth watching!"
1132,1.0,I barely got threw half the film and Ill tell you Idris Elba should go to the bank and return the money they paid him for this role not because he was bad at it but because they convinced him to play the role in this awful film if you can call it that. Wow what a freaking Bomb of a movie the first one was bad but you could at least get through it. I happen to love and respect the directors previous work I think they are very good at what they do but the true curse of this Ghost Rider found its way out once again with a vengeance (no pun intended). I almost felt as if I were set on fire for even trying to give it a viewing and Nicolas Cage love the Cage but Damn brother whats with the run of Bad films whats happening with the choices.(Your slowly loosing public respect for your craft). Try and find the fire within you once again and stay away from Johnny Blaze. I would not recommend watching this movie even to the undead.
1133,2.0,"One thing that always escapes me when it comes to this supposed found footage genre, which unfortunately has long grown stale, is how when the crap's about to hit the fan, the characters would rather turn their video camera in as opposed to running away. Yet, for some reason they seem to draw a lot of audiences. Look at the 83 minute exercise in audience trolling we got earlier this year, ""The Devil Inside"". Found footage? Check. Made a large impression at the box office? check.

And so we have a movie yet again that sticks somclose to its found footage guns, Chronicle. The found footage genre makes its way to the superpower realm. A bunch of teenagers encounter a strange glowy green thing and auddenly have superpowers? Sounds like X-Men, doesn't it? Sadly it's nowhere near as fun, in fact, in the fun department, it's miles and miles behind.

The film is taken from the video camera of Andrew (DeHaan, True Blood), a lonely, bored and abused teenager who lives with his dying mother and alcoholic, abusive father who beats him to a pulp on a regular basis. His only friend is his cousin, Matt (Russell, who could very well be Thomas Bangalter's long lost cousin). For some reason, Andrew feels the need to tape absolutely everything that goes on in life, and does so for the first twenty minutes on an old school over the shoulder camera.

At a party one night, he and his cousin meet Steve, a character who unfortunately gets reduced to being the token black guy. They go into a hole where there's a green glowy rock and ta da, because of it, they have superpowers. Big whoop. They can perform telekinesis and stuff. Then Andrew gets pushed a tad too far, he can't control his powers, he loves being dark and evil, and blah, blah, blah. Oh and I'll note there several parts where Andrew plays with the camera using his powers.

Like I said, this film is too found footage for my liking. First off, a good portion of the movie does a fail job at hiding the films heavy reliance on the gimmick.  A lot of shots show the camera being held by telekinesis and what not. There's a one scene I actually laughed out loud- it happens before Andrew's father visits him in the hospital, and the security guard tells him ""the camera has to stay on"". At that part, it was clear the movie lives and breathes the gimmick.

It's a shame because the acting for the most part is well done. Dane DeHaan is exceptional in the role and he captures the essence of a poor teenager being driven to insanity and embracing his dark side. His performance really chilling- it's like a high school shooting, almost like you're inn he mind of the disturbed killer. Russell is great too as his cousin although at the end it's too he just wants Andrew off his freaking lawn. Steve is a decent actor as well.

So what went wrong? What happened where i found the movie to be... Well, boring? Was I even supposed to care? Either way, this was one big headache of a movie and I certainly wouldn't be recommending it any time soon."
1134,3.0,"This review contains MILD spoilers. No names are mentioned, but astute readers won't find it hard to figure out who I'm talking about. Normally I avoid writing spoilers as much as I can, but I have found that, no matter how I phrase this review, it's still pretty obvious. I believe that is due less to my failings as a writer, and more to the failings of the movie's script. Even this website's staff review pretty much gives it away. Still, for those of you who are devout haters of spoilers, STOP READING NOW.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHRONICLE is one of those films that is annoyingly close to being really, really good. The story concerns three high school seniors -- Andrew, Matt, and Steve. Andrew's mother is dying of lung cancer and his father is an abusive alcoholic. Andrew himself is your typical put-upon loser, the kind of skinny, whiny-voiced kid who seems to have forgotten to go through puberty. Although his family circumstances obviously make him a sympathetic character, it is not hard to see why he is so relentlessly bullied and teased at school. He's mopey, cowardly, isolated, and he carries a freaking camera around with him wherever he goes. Even to a rave.

Then, lo and behold, the boys stumble across a strange hole in the ground, inside of which is some kind of mysterious glowing force that emits sounds like feedback from a speaker the size of a bus. The boys investigate (natch) and then, whatdoyaknow, they find that they have developed super powers from the strange object (which conveniently disappears for the rest of the film).

The remainder of the story deals with the guys coming to terms with their new abilities (they don't seem particularly fazed by it) and learning how to use them. From here on out, the movie -- desperate for a villain -- takes the story down very predictable avenues. It turns out that having too much power can corrupt you (I'm surprised no one's ever realized this before), and before long, it's a battle royale to determine who will be the top dog of their little triumvirate.

The special effects are fantastic. They are nearly seamless, which helps detract from the fact that this is a ""found footage"" movie. These types of movies use the ""found footage"" conceit to enhance the realism of the film, but in a case like this, it mostly just detracts from the story. What does it say about a movie that it is much easier to believe that a character can fly or move things with his mind than it is to believe that he carries a running camera with him every single solitary place he goes? Even up in the clouds, at night, during a thunderstorm, while he cries alone because he puked beer on a girl that wanted to sleep with him. He even carries it to a funeral, for heaven's sake.

Near the end, when the film shifts back and forth between security cameras, news footage, and phone cameras, the ""found footage"" aspect becomes, ironically, less intrusive. At least, it seems more plausible. However, by then, the movie has devolved into a standard superhero showdown. Throughout the film, there are multiple references to philosophers and their beliefs on human nature, desire, or reality. It leads viewers to believe that there might be some kind of deeper theory driving the story, that there might be an allegory here for something grander and more interesting than teenagers playing football in the stratosphere. But, no. It seems as if the whole thing is basically about how much it sucks to be bullied by classmates and drunk dads.

Even that wouldn't be so bad if the movie didn't foolishly conclude with a complete logical back-flip. The movie's message -- perhaps muddied by its need for a clear-cut antagonist and conflict -- is literally told to the audience by a character who reminds us that, while the villain killed many people and endangered the lives of countless others in a blind fit of petulant rage, he was still basically a good guy at heart.

Wrong, movie. You can't have it both ways, at least not with a story that lacks as much meat as this one. Because the characters are so one-dimensional, the movie only works on a chewy, eye-candy level, but it desperately wants to make a watered-down point about Nature vs. Nurture, or perhaps the psychology of prepubescence. Either way, it comes across as half-baked, heavy-handed, and actually pretty ridiculous. And that's saying a lot for a film where teens use superpowers to scare little girls at toy stores.

Watch it for the special effects, but be prepared to be steadily annoyed by Andrew's nails-on-a-chalkboard voice and the rather quick-and-easy slide the movie takes from ""Gee, these powers are awesome"" to ""The world must burn!"""
1135,2.0,"Let me say first that I agree with a lot of what the other reviewers have said both good and bad. The audience was quite happy with this movie, and it made for a nice date. It's a piece of fluff -- but it's bad fluff. Now, wait, I was going to give the good parts first.  Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy.  Some funny bits, like the paintball scene, the way each guy spoils the other's dates.  That's about it.  I'd add Chelsea Handler for a couple of funny remarks, but I really don't see what she's doing in the movie. Uh, and the cinematography is often very good. That's about it.

The bad parts are really, really bad. For the romcom format, this is a disaster. There is no chemistry between Chris Pine and Reese Witherspoon. I mean, when McG has to mount a kitchen counter to show Pine and Witherspoon how to do foreplay, you know there's a problem. There is no chemistry between Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon, either. Uh, I forgot another good thing: the chemistry between Pine and Hardy is great; they play off of each other (think Eames and Arthur in Inception)with genuine comedic talent. Which is surprising given their out of the box casting. I'd read that both men wanted to add some fluff to their resumes but they're wasted here. What they need is a vehicle that has a good script and a good director. Reese Witherspoon did the Oscar-winning June Carter Cash role years ago, and the Legally Blonde thing even longer than that. McG says she wanted to show off her sexy side here. That may have something to do with the zero chemistry thing. Plot problems: the premise is weak. Two incompetent covert-operations agents have been grounded, and so they play around with surf-dating. Would you believe -- they both fall for the same woman! Complication: they are closer than brothers, than partners, they ""would take a bullet"" for each other. However, when the time comes to test this bond, the men become twelve-year-olds and begin a series of gotcha/gotcha-back stunts. The plot has a lot of holes in it. What's Chelsea Handler doing in the movie? She provides nothing to fill out Witherspoon's character or to move the plot forward. She's given some witty impromptu lines. What's the bad-guy thing doing here? It's superfluous and badly done. The action scenes could certainly work with the stunts the two agents pull. And why is Angela Bassett in this movie? OMG The amount of wasted talent is humongous. McG's direction is, is, invisible. There is no direction here. All three of the actors try to build something with Legos, but McG insists on tearing it down.  As a director, he shoots good videos.

 Now for the worst criminal of all for the movie: the screenwriter(s). Let me start with the story's ending. It's ridiculous. ""Don't choose the better man,"" Handler tells her, ""choose the man who will make you better."" Is she kidding? Reese does choose one of the men, but lest the audience feel cheated for the fate of the other -- kind of ruining the romcom's happy, satisfying ending-- he is given something to look forward to without Reese. I'd say he's the guy who really wins the ""war."" I read an interview where Hardy and Pine suggest writing an ending which would have been far more satisfying, not to say really funny, but McG nixed it. He did say, though, that there would be an alternate ending on the dvd. If the dvd sells for three bucks, I'll buy it for that. (And Tom Hardy. Did I mention him?)  Oh, this is supposed to be the bad stuff. The screenwriter(s) must have been on crack. Or were paid two bucks a page. Will Smith and Reese produced this, and you'd think they'd have burned the script after reading it. Witherspoon has mentioned that when she thought one or another of the scenes ""wasn't working,"" she'd change it. I mean, she admitted that. Whoa. The dialogue is not good enough to be called cliched. It's embarrassing. Since its release, both Pine and Hardy have had the charity to damn it with faint praise. Good for them. There is no cohesive story; the plot is choppy and some scenes gratuitous. It's like a string of miscellaneous scenes that someone forgot to edit.

Verdict: So-freaking-so. Have a couple of drinks before seeing this. Suspend all disbelief. Do not expect a good romcom. Do not expect comedic performances. Think back to your high-school days and the people you knew then, the popular girl, the sweet nerd, the jock, in an impossible triangle. Did you like them then?  You won't like them now, either. Save your money instead of seeing this on the big screen. Rent the dvd, pop some corn, cuddle up on the sofa, and enjoy the fluff. Just don't expect it to be good fluff. In the meantime, rent a good Hepburn-Tracy movie if you want an intelligent romcom -- and a really funny one."
1136,4.0,"This was one of those instances where low expectations really paid off. Had I realized that the film was directed by Nicholas Stoller (the man behind Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek), then I may have had a bit more confidence in it.

Trailers made it seem like The Five-Year Engagement wasn't going to be so great though. It just looked like every other formulaic R-rated comedy out there. Several people who also attended the screening I went to felt the same way. ""This'll be decent at best,"" we all thought. Thankfully we were gob smacked with something a lot better than okay that was just shy of being really great.

The Five-Year Engagement is obviously centered on Tom and Violet, but the supporting cast is so freaking good. The Alex and Suzie characters are hilarious. Suzie has this party girl kind of quality to her, but she's so emotional and really spontaneous. Alex is the typical jock/playboy type of character, but his one-liners are really funny. At their wedding, Alex sings this song to Suzie in Spanish. That alone is fantastic, but his facial expressions just take it to an entirely different level of hilarity.

Violet's classmates in college; Ming (Randall Park), Doug (Kevin Hart), and Vaneetha (""The Office""'s Mindy Kaling) have more than their share of stand-out scenes. Tarquin (Brian Posehn) is funny in this really inappropriate way and Bill's (Chris Parnell) fascination with knitting sweaters is a gag that somehow never really gets old.

Tom and Violet have so many classic scenes, as well. The bedroom conversation where Tom just wants to be alone is the first that comes to mind. Then there's the fake orgasm scene and Tom's ridiculous apron. The scene people will probably be talking about most though is the scene when Violet and Suzie are having a conversation while imitating Cookie Monster and Elmo. That might be the most humorous sequence in the entire comedy.

The Five-Year Engagement isn't just a flat comedy though. It has layers to it. These characters feel like they have some depth to them. There's character development and drama, heartbreak and depression, and compassion and reconnection on top of the comedy. It's a comedy that makes a complete cycle to actually feel like you're witnessing an authentic relationship.

The film does feel a bit long though. The second act just drags on and on at times. Some of the psychology bits didn't seem completely necessary to the storyline either and the last hour could've been trimmed down a good twenty to thirty minutes.

The Five-Year Engagement runs longer than it should, but is otherwise a very charming R-rated romantic comedy. The way these characters are planned out and the decisions they make feel very human. Delightfully sincere and downright hilarious at times, The Five-Year Engagement is a pleasant surprise and a fantastic date night comedy that will appeal to both sexes."
1137,5.0,Everyone says you can't recreate the original don't know about that ask joss Whedon that guy can write! But no problems with it took a long freaking time to get here but I did ask for the long delivery (my fault) but I have it and it awesome still even seeing from the cinema and now blu ray!
1138,2.0,"Problem with this movie is that it follows all the cliches and plots of every other freaking alien movie: humans visit alien ship that seems deserted, finds out that there are some aliens that are alive and try to kill to crew, also find out that aliens are trying to destroy earth, only surviving human kills the aliens and returns to earth."
1139,4.0,"This is why I only gave it four stars because I thought it was lacking in some places.
I rented this from the library:

 It's supposed to be a modern day retelling of the Snow White and The Seven Dwarves) cartoon movie set to real action but it's too dark and too medieval for what they told in this version and I do like medieval stories because of the swords and weapons that they use, (I'm a big fan of swords) but a troll, really? an dthe names of the dwarves were all wrong (I think I counted 8 of them at one time and the one that died when he got the arrow in the back by the name of 'Gus' wasn't in the cartoon version, I was wondering how they made actor Bob Hoskins look so small (smaller than he is in real life as I saw him in Unleashed with Jet Li and I think he's only about 5 foot 5 inches in real life, but he looks even smaller here, I guess it's just a camera trick they use. I guess I just like the cartoon version better because it was so comical in it's telling of the fairy tale. And Chris Hemsworth did a pretty bang up job as the Huntsman but I don't see the correlation between this version and the disney cartoon one. Some of the special effects kept me wondering too and the evil queen's wardrobe was pretty cool. I see that they made the cover picture on the dvd of the queen a bit larger as if she's the main title character point for the movie. The scenery and locales were spectacular because I watched the extras on the disc and found out that they filmed parts in Stotland and South Wales, I've always wanted to hike through some of those areas of Scotland but they did say that it's freaking cold there in those parts they filmed in.

 **I almost can't wait to see The Hobbit, coming soon."
1140,2.0,I got this to try to understand the movie and I'm still freaking lost.  I do love Noomi
1141,1.0,"I saw this because a lot of my friends said it was sooooo funny. I need new friends. What a moronic plot, premise, bear freaking thing whatever. You will come out stupider from watching this and them you could watch anything and think it's hilarious. Not sure why Mark Wahlberg fell so low, sure he was Marky Mark at one point but I thought his loser days were over. Pathetic."
1142,3.0,"This film was really an interesting film to watch. And I mean it. When it was released back in September 2012, I had no such interest in watching it. For me the film just looked lame. I know you should never judge a book by its cover; I was just totally uninterested in this film.  For starters it had that gangster's vibe going for it. And I just don't like gangster movies, for one and the fact that it involved  killing people randomly, which I like, but this film kind of (for me) seemed to go over the edge and get a little too extreme. When I watched it, it had a very realistic and dark thing about it. What got me threw it all was the mesmerizing performances, by lead Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and supporters, Noah Segan and Emily Blunt. Okay so the issues with this film include  Bruce Willis, length, and ending. Bruce Willis. The man behind Die Hard. I don't know what to say, the guy has lost it. He just can't act anymore, why he does it most likely now is to put food on the table.  Whenever he's onscreen he just doesn't seem to be n it, he doesn't have the same momentum he used to have. The dude unlike Sylvester Stallone just can't do it anymore. He's given up trying. His scenes were very poorly acted.  The length of this film is way too long. I can think of a couple of scenes that should have been cut, or shortened more. It's just way too unbearable.  This film could have made for a decent Hour and a half film, but instead the people behind it added un- necessary additions to the film such as the half naked women in the bed scene, and the ""kid blue"" getting his knuckles cracked scene.  Those were lengthy additions that made little difference to the story. The ending to this film was also a bit of a disappointment for me. It ended with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character killing himself so that the crazy future him, Bruce Willis wouldn't kill the kid. It was a very poor ending. The kid should have just been killed and Levitt's character ending it by killing the future him.  The kid was freaking nuts, and would end up being a ruthless killer. The kid killed people, he was already a lost cause, and Emily Blunt's character man was she a freaking air head. She should have killed the son. Heck with it, I would have, he was nuts. Well now to the good things. It includes the acting, special effects, and character development. The acting as I already explained was very good. Memorable you could say.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt nails another role in the head. He is most likely one of the best actors of today. Every film I see him in is more un- forgettable then the last! He is excellent in his role, and adds depth to his character. And a few supporting cast members as I've already stated were excellent as well.  The special effects, while minimal, are excellent and sharpened to the tip.  The character development is by far the best thing. All of the character's back stories are told neatly and well. All of the character's had an emotional back story, and you felt something for each one, good and bad. You felt their issues and problems, big and small.  Every character was proven to be realistic and had something about them that at least one person could relate to.  All in All, Looper might not be a big success, but it puts its characters in the right place and just seems realistic, and emotional. C+"
1143,5.0,"Great action movie.  Jason Statham is so damn cute, fun to watch JLo freaking out when she gets in trouble."
1144,1.0,"not even worth the $3 dollar rental. story sucks, characters suck, everything sucks, I can't believe a movie with this much money and effects could suck so freaking hard-"
1145,1.0,"I got suckered by the hype of this pile of trash. I admit it.

Kind of the warning sign to me that I need to think before I go blindly into watching flicks recommended by professional critics and comic book nerds.

Everyone in the cult of Dredd is kind of weird. It's something I don't understand anymore. I guess I missed the appeal of Karl Urban gunning down random poor people/criminals in a apartment building while Lena Headey sits around doing nasty things to people.

About the only thing that seems to get anything out of me is Anderson played by Olivia Thirlby, who is the only character with a real arc or background besides maybe Headey and one of her random hired guns in the building who we only find out is a family man.

Otherwise everyone else is about as faceless and badly written as you can get.  Best of all is your growling main character who is wearing the helmet because the comic book nerds demand he keeps it on throughout or else!

Urban's performance closely resembles a bad Clint Eastwood impersonation, I mean this guy does a killer Deforest Kelly one in Start Trek, but can't pull off a Eastwood, that's shameful.

Even his role in Priest seemed to feel like Gary Oldman or something, and he excelled at it. Here, he's kind of just eh.

I'm not going to blabber about how violent the movie is, because why bother, plenty complain about it on here as it is. The violence is rather over the top, which is an underestimate really. I kind of wonder if the MPAA was asleep at the wheel when rating this movie, I mean they gave Killer Joe such a freaking hard time the previous year before this one.  But this one, they apparently didn't care.

I think if anything, Deadpool showed this movie up in the R-rated comic book movie contest, I mean it actually succeeded and raked in the money and got people hooked. This  did not, and I have to fault the writers of this movie for making a movie with no really background or anything to it or barely any existing.  They made it hard for anyone to really get hooked into anything about this character.

I mean that's something that even Stallone did better, he gave something to the character, an arc, something, Yeah, he had to tone the violence down and make it cheesy and put Robbie the idiot front and center. That was back when Robbie the Idiot was getting his 10 seconds of attempted fame, before getting sentenced to only Adam Sandler movies and DTV land. Robbie the Idiot had also been in Demolition Man, which was a better movie than Stallone's Dredd, but it nailed the satire and humor that really is missing in this movie.

Frankly only Paul Verhoven seemed to nail this kind of nasty witty humor in his films like Total Recall, Robocop. Robocop is based on Dredd and is probably the best adaptations that never was for it. This movie barely has any humor to it, it's too busy trying to be sober and serious. Even Stallone's Dredd seemed to know it wanted to be a satire or something besides dour and dull.

Slow-mo is a horrible device for a writer to create to justify endless slow motion action scenes or violence scenes. You know if you wanted to be John Woo, just be freaking John Woo, it's not going to kill you not to have some lame plot device to explain your love for slow motion shootings! It's infuriating that the drugs couldn't of been something that wasn't so stupid and hard to say with a straight face.

Armand Assante eats the scenery of the original movie and Headey just soaks in baths and tortures and cuts things off of people. She really just acts smug throughout, and it's a boring smug, not very entertaining to watch or even be invested in.

The special effects look cheap and crappy, the costumes look rather cheap as well. One shot of the city they included I swear basically could have been stolen from Blade Runner. That probably would have saved CGI money. You can create a future city and not make it look like Blade Runner, be more original with your design movie, for god's sakes. And we barely see any of the city as it is.

I would say the movie's action scenes are something to watch, but they aren't either. Not when 2012 had End of Watch, Skyfall, Django Unchained, Premium Rush, Jack Reacher, The Expendables 2, The Raid. Then again even Act of Valor and Safe House had better action scenes, because I actually freaking cared about the characters in the movie.
And it's kind of pointless for me if I don't really care who lives or who dies in the action scenes. I mean everyone is nearly detestable, maybe the computer hacker guy and Anderson are about it. I really thought they should of just offed Dredd at the end of this movie, good ending, instead some weak Deus Ex Machina patch helps him live. BOO!

Finally, the fanboys of this movie are insufferable people. I understand the fact that you like it, that's nice, I don't. Please stop wearing others out because they don't. These fans are also very desperate for a sequel, apparently never coming. I doubt also Netflix is springing for a series about this. You're not Marvel or DC owned, so forget it.  But the fans live in a blissfully ignorant world of thinking a sequel is going to be popped into production anytime now.

Lionsgate is a really B-level movie company, they produce cheap action movies and their biggest claims to fame are Hunger Games, Expendables, Twilight and independent movies usually action ones. In some ways, they are to me like Cannon Films. Cheap, predictable action pumped out for the action fan to look at and forget the next moment. I realize they are only distributing this movie, but really it seems no different than any of their other B-level action gore fests. The only difference is that Jason Statham isn't in it or some aging action star.

It's rather sad to see this type of potentially great movie squandered by being nothing but a paint by the numbers action flick. I mean the source material could warrant a better version than Stallone, but it would have to be someone with a witty, sharp humor level.

By the way the score is a wretched John Carpenter sound a like, which is insulting as it gets. I guess ripping off is the sincerest form of flattery.

My opinion on this pile of whatever. What a disappointment that only caters to weird fans of this comic book and even they couldn't bother to actively go see it well enough or even spread a good word about it. But part of me thinks Lionsgate knew they had a dud on their hands so they sabotaged it anyway to sink it fast. By the way, if you want a good R-rated Comic Book action movie, there's a whole list of them: Watchmen, Sin City 1 or 2, Blade 1 or 2, Deadpool, hell for obscure foreign movie watchers, Lone wolf and Cub is a particularly violent and exciting Manga/Comic adaptation made in the early 70s that is pretty good."
1146,3.0,"OK I admit, time-travel films are hard to grasp but I am also relatively intelligent. However, even if you dismiss me, my husband is a freaking genius AND a film junkie so we both could not demystify the plot. It was good. It was enjoyable. there was no way I would have not finished watching it and I have no issues stopping films half-way if they are going to waste my time but alas, I am still not happy with how it all ended. But it had Bruce Willis so really, why am I complaining? :)"
1147,3.0,"I bought this movie thinking it would be funny because it's got Ben Stiller, Jonah Hill and Vince Vaughn. It's one of the most ridiculous comedies I have ever seen.  When I say ridiculous, I mean really freaking stupid. It's a movie about them becoming a team as a neighborhood to keep the people safe from harm and crime, well later in the movie an alien crash lands and they decide to investigate it. Need I say more? I don't think so."
1148,5.0,"I'm really puzzled by some of the bad reviews here. I think these people just aren't sic-fi fans (like my wife). This movie is not for everyone but if you like sci-fi movies you should really like this one. None the less I have enjoyed this movie in theaters and and at home in 3D. Personally I think this movies rocks! Some bad ass CGI worlds and special effects along with a strange and twisting story. All these critics here claiming it's a rip off from other movies...I've never seen a sci-fi movie with the plot of ""what they found on the other planet and why that planet was set up the way it was"" ...no spoiler so I choose my words carefully. But really freaking cool how the story unfolds once on the new planet. I was not expecting the element of horror. I'm not a fan of horror movies but I like when they are done in sci-fi without a lot of gore.  I also enjoyed the beginning opening sequence of how the aliens left there DNA behind, pretty cool. The writers even threw in the God factor to this movie, and a battle with Faith and science, and I loved that about the movie. I for one am with the Christian scientist :)
I think Ridley Scott did a great job with this movie and Prometheus is one of my favorite sic-fi movies. I don't think I've seen a Ridley Scott movie yet that I didn't like. I really hope Prometheus part 2 comes out because they left it wide open. At $20 for 3D, BR, digital copy and Ultra-Violet you can't go wrong with this 4 disc set.  If you have the capability to watch it in 3D then do it first, other wise blu-ray. What can I say I've seen this movies twice in 3D and both times it was bad A$$."

I have a new 75 inch Sony Ultra 4K TV arriving in the next two weeks and I have to be able to see this movie in 4K resolution.  It is an absolutely beautiful movie.

1152,1.0,I thought a movie with Logan Marshall-Green couldn't be so bad since I could just watch his scenes and drool and at least that might be great but no. I was freaking wrong. This movie was awful even Charlize Theron was terrible in it. Maybe I don't get it but I did not get the appeal of this movie at all.
1153,4.0,"I have to begin by saying I was surprised by how much this film did not suck. Horror movies are a genre in which 90 to 95% of the material offered is bad, and that figure rises to 99% when dealing with remakes, reboots, prequels and sequels. TEXAS CHAINSAW is in some measure all of these things, so I was expecting about as much quality as youd find in the sluice gate at a slaughterhouse. As it turns out, its actually pretty goodif you can get past the gristle.

TEXAS CHAINSAW begins just hours after the events of the 1974 original left off, explaining what happened to the cannibalistic Sawyer clan after one of their would-be victims escaped and contacted authorities. Cut to today, where the gorgeous Alexandra Daddario, her boyfriend Trey Songz, her slutty best friend (Tanya Raimone), and his buddy (Karam Malicki), are setting out on a roadtrip to Texas. Seems A has discovered that her just-deceased grandmother has left her a house there. Daddario is in a state of upset because in receiving the house she has also just discovered that she was actually adopted, and that her parents are therefore not her real parents. Driving south, the gang adds a handsome hitchhiker (Scott Eastwood) to their group,  thus demonstrating that, like most horror-movie characters, they don't have a helluva lotta sense.  Eventually the crew arrives at the supposedly empty Plantation-style house, set on walled-in grounds in the woods, and are given the keys by a shifty-acting lawyer (Richard Riehle). Ignoring a warning to read grandmas will BEFORE they go inside, the gang soon discovers two unpleasant facts: 1) the house is NOT empty, and 2) the townsfolk know something about the history of both the houses hidden occupant and A.D. herself, things they are very keen the gang not discover. What follows involves pretty much what youd expect from an entry in this franchise: screaming, running, chainsaws, meat-hooks, dismemberment, face-peelings, face-wearings, salad bowls full of severed fingers, chainsaws, gratuitous but welcome semi-nudity, small-town intrigue, buckets of blood, complex family ties, and more chainsaws. If you have never seen one of these movies, this is as complete a tutorial as you would need  you simply won't look at the McCullough in the tool shed the same way again. Nor should you. After all  the saw is family!

As I said, and despite a lot of very bad reviews  the Tomameter reading on this flick was a sickly 19% --this is a surprisingly not-bad film. The acting is good all the way around, the mounting tension is nicely balanced by sudden and vicious outbursts of blood and gore (disgusting, but not over-the-top), and the film is professionally lit and shot once the inept opening is finished. The rip-roar of the chainsaw becomes gut-tightening as the movie goes on, evoking a sort of Pavlovian fear-response from the viewer, and there is something just genuinely horrible about that hulking guy in the basement in the human face mask. Gunnar Hansen is far more effective physically playing Leatherface than Kane Hodder ever was as Jason Voorhees, and despite his age still knows how to ply his grisly trade with a young mans vitality, sawing apart Volkswagen vans and lumbering through State Fairs after his prey with the single-minded focus of a guided missile. And to sweeten the deal, Daddario is so f-ing other-wordly gorgeous and has such a hot body I was just mesmerized by her presence from the first frame. And there is an easter egg after the credits which is gruesomely funny to behold, if a bit over the top.

Now, when I say its not bad, I don't mean its perfect. There are numerous problems with the story, starting with its clumsy and badly-written opening, in which the film tries to evoke some sense of sympathy for the Sawyers  a vicious, inbred, cannibalistic group of sadistic murderers who make ornaments out of their victims  and finishing with the movies climax, which, following the moronic trend of modern horror, also tries to make Leatherface look like a sympathetic character and completely rapes the characterization of Daddario's character. (Blood may be thicker than water, but chainsaw grease is thicker than blood.) Furthermore, every twist in the script is something you can see from three miles off, and it is possible with close to 100% certainty to figure out who is going to live and who is going to die the moment they are introduced. As with all horror movies, the police behave with lombotomized stupidity, and as with all CHAINSAW films going back to '74, the chainsaw itself is called upon to do things it could never actually do in real life, becoming the bad-guy equivalent of the gun that doesn't need to reload. Finally, and without unleashing a spoiler, I can say that the dark secret the town is trying to protect would in real-life have been the source of endless boasting. Nobody would try to hide their participation in what the townsfolk did to the cannibals living in their midst. They would put it on freaking YouTube!

This, then, is TEXAS CHAINSAW, 90 minutes of tension and grue delivered to you in a surprisingly effective package, with a couple of extremely hot women to sweeten the deal. It won't be competing for Greatest Horror Movie of All Time,  but by and large it does what it sets out to do, which is remind you that if you are in Texas and you hear a chainsaw start up, you should probably keep driving until you hit Nova Scotia."
1154,1.0,"This latest edition to the TCM franchise is by far the very worst movie ever made and I definitely mean that.  Need an example?  How about the line, ""Do your thing cuz!""  Enough said.  This movie had so much extremely bad acting and the corniest and lamest dialogue ever written that I shook my head constantly while in the theater and wanted to walk right out this steaming crap fest half way through the film, all and all I would say don't even watch this pile of dog crap even if it comes on TV and you are really bored, it's that freaking horrible!!"
1155,1.0,"Within the first five minutes, I wanted to turn this movie off--as soon as she said in the voice over, the eyeroll-worthy ""wargasms"", I had had enough.  I have very little patience for movies lately.
Even so, I forced myself to continue watching--it's Oliver Stone, right?
Oh, but it gets worse, because ""O"" then watches a video of decapitated heads and has no human reaction.  ""Oh, like people being tortured and beheaded, like. um, sigh and stuff""  And whilst the ""men"" then discuss this dangerous new development--another drug cartel wishing to take them over with threats of death included, the dingbat girlfriend joins the conversation and all but twirls her hair and bats her eyes and says, ""Let's, like, go party and stuff!""  I paraphrase, forgive me.

 Is she concerned with this seething, vicious threat to herself, her way of living, or to these two men that she supposedly loves SO much?  No!  Gee, I would be.  But, you know, that's just me.

They plan to leave the country, escape the cartel, and what does she do next?  She goes to the mall!!!!!  And the morons LET her!!  Because, you know, when attempting to double cross a clever drug cartel, I always plan on calmly, dreamily promenading through department stores, making innumerable purchases, and changing into new clothes--WHILE I'M SHOPPING.
IN THE REAL WORLD,  I'd be freaking out, terrified that something bad would happen, I'd leave immediately--Stone could have milked that part of the film, he could have really saturated it with such incredible suspense and genuine fear, it could have been so gripping.  But he destroyed it all. What a lost opportunity.

I guess I'm expecting more from people in their twenties, whether potheads or no, a serious situation is a serious situation, right?  These people act like thirteen year olds, like my nephew, just very unaware of consequences. It was infuriating to watch.

As for the rest of the movie, the twists and turns, the brutality, eh.  It was okay.  I think Salma Hayek was good in her role, but I don't like the relationship that was developed between her character and O, it, too, was off and contrived.  All of them seemed like cartoon characters, or caricatures, they should have been drawn with far more gravity, then the film would have been fascinating."
1156,1.0,"So, let me get this straight, ancient astronauts are found and we make our way to their home world; it's the first contact with aliens. When they get there, the crew starts a bunch of petulant behavior and the chief scientist starts boozing it up. Geez, Hollywood, I guess you assume your entire audience is a bunch of freaking retards. Well, I suppose you're right. I spent $3.99 and all I got was 2.5 seconds of where the Alien came from. Hint:from a guy's gut.

Actually, come to think of it, there was four bucks worth of information in this movie. If you are ever trying to run away from a giant ring shaped space ship that is falling down toward you and rolling along it's perimeter, turn 90 degrees and run, rather than run along the path of the falling space ship."
1157,4.0,"This was one of those movies with a really cute trailer, the little boy with all the zombie stuff in his room, posters, clocks, lights, etc.  Turns out he is a boy that can see and talk to the dead and it doesnt freak him out as much as those around him, even the ghosts are not freaking out they can be seen.  The animation is good through a bit gross, slimy, gooey and floppy corpse tongue, if you have a kid or wife that doesnt like that sort of thing you might want to warn them.  The story was good and more original then some of the things that are out there lately, though the twist was easy to see coming (and I am often surprised in movies) so I would say it is a bit more of a kids flick than some of the other animation out there."
1158,3.0,"Well, the effects are nice.  The scenario is interesting for about 30 minutes.  But, seriously, the movie is boring.  Not to mention unrealistic.

Firstly, all those animals were hiding out and not killing each other?  This kid did not hear them?  Had the writer ever seen any of these animals in the wild or in captivity even?

A hyena and a zebra are not going to snuggle in hiding.  That zebra would be kicking and freaking out and overturning that boat.  Second, that kid stood no chance in a boat with a tiger.  Let alone with a hyena!  Those beasts are mean and nasty.  Look them up.

Look, supposedly this story is full of symbolism one should enjoy interpreting.  Ok, there may be educational value in this movie.  But entertainment value?  Not much.

This movie requires effort to enjoy.  Effort to sustain suspension of disbelief.  Effort to interpret its elements.  Effort to stay awake.

NOT RECOMMENDED."
1159,5.0,"Alright. Prometheus isn't for everywne. You'll love or hate it. Or like or loathe it. The plot is rife with holes, scientific method advisers were clearly not consulted in the studio's rush to get this movie out after god knows how many years since Alien now? And these aliens look way too much like us to be scary.

There are astronaut zombies and cobratic phallic hissing dentata-face things, as suggested by other reviewers. But it's more like a horror scifi Tone Poem. A sort of visual symphony. With proper logic notes and implausible hues, it kinda draws you into a world that's vast and alien, yet with archetypes sprinkled throughout which awaken glimpses of prescient wonder, harkening back to our genetic memories. What would confronting your creator be like? How would You fare?

Sir Ridley Scott has created a particularly potent world, and populated it with dunderheads. Monty Python in outer space might've done better, even survived the events. Benny Hill would've made it out. I'm talking about some of the writing required to get the crew from point A to point Z in the movie, with all the scares intact.  The actual actors played it perfectly. And even the characters were well rounded, for their roles. I think many sympathize with Shaw, as many as with David. When he says ""I think I can,"" at the end, it's chilling.

Themes in the movie delve into lineage, mortality and genetics, with emphasis on an alien catalytic fluid, where accelerated dna dissolution and recombination yields voracious organisms that quickly wipe everything out, morphing towards their host's form with every generation. The end of the movie is great in that regard, by the way.

Monsters? Exploding heads? Zombie spacemen? Self-induced abortion of a tentacled demon foetus? All there.

Presentation is epic. Sets feel totally real. Costumes, setting, lighting, spacecraft, effects? Magnificent. Biblical at points.

This is a companion to Alien, more than a prequel. What else happened in that universe, that Ripley happened on to? The events are in different planets... so it's easy to think of them as nearly simultaneous. So while Shaw is off looking for the creators, the colonial marines are getting splattered.

It would be soooooo freaking cool if Blade Runner was tied into this world somehow. It would make Ridley Scott's epic legacy even grander than it already is."
1160,1.0,This movie is freaking gross! I don't know what they were thinking.they took a decent story and made it an up close and personal bloodbath with in your face exploding heads and way too much gore. If you like seeing fatal car accidents in real life then by all means buy this atrocity but if you are like most of us don't waste your money!
1161,5.0,"I think some people who are true sci-fi fans and either didn't like this movie initially or were confused on how to feel about it should watch it again.

I watched this the first nite it came out in theatres and everyone was super quiet after the movie ended. I think everyone was processing...This movie doesn't use the typical sci fi tactics to engage the audience... there isn't really a constant feed of mind-numbing visual action one would assume. This movie was done tastefully (for the most part) and speaking of good taste...wow, there is a really freaking hot guy in this. Logan Marshall-Green is so friggin' hawwwwwwt he made me smile just watching him. But prepare thyself because there is a price to pay for those good looks of his. I will not spoil anything but if you're squirmish, get ready!. .

Initially it was hard for me to accept Noomi as the female protagonist for a few reasons. I'll just come out and say it: there is something off-putting about her facial structure and hair for me. Her bone structure is maybe just bad on film. I wanted to slick her hair back the whole movie because it was always in her face. Not to mention her accent in this. In the end, she won me over with her perseverance for answers despite the obstacles and her ability to survive. I can't say I'm sold on the idea that she would have pushed through all she did due to how her character was presented, but I accepted it and kept my eye on the idea her character brought up which is you may not like what answers you find that reside beyond your faith but the truth is freeing. She really is a pretty good actress so eventually my shallow reasons for not liking her fell by the wayside.

I love the guy who plays the captain of the Prometheus- Idris Elba. He has a few cheesy lines, but I think he was good for the role. And ya gotta have the black guy! Charlize Theron is, as usual, wonderful to watch. Fassbender was pretty good but I never got why he was such a vindictive android plus I had just recently seen him in Shame and the transition from a sex crazed sad guy to android was a little (*cough*) hard to shake. Guy Pearce was okay at best being a gross old rich man; I wish they would have just used an old man though. Older actors need roles and this would have fit the bill for the right old man. And I REALLY wish they would have better visualized the ship itself since the movie was even named after it. I never got a good sense of the layout. One of the things I didn't like about this movie.

SPOILER ALERT! The aliens in the movie are well done. I got so frustrated when the alien doesn't answer Dr. Shaw in some way after she pleads for answers and pours her heart out. In his facial expression, the alien seems moved by her briefly, but then the android steps in and just pisses him off. You'd think Mr. Weyland would have a better plan for first contact than to use an android as ambassador asking for sh1t. That is not how you get what you want. No less from an HR Giger represented alien species.

Despite the stereotypical plot twists and tactics, I really enjoyed this film. I wish there were more sci-fi movies in general and I've always been a fan of Aliens (and I'm not too big on scary stuffz). Don't expect perfection from it, despite my 5 star rating. Compared to all the thoughtless garbage Hollywood makes these days, this is a gem... You might just need to give it a second (or third) chance to let it charm you."
1162,5.0,"This film is absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end. The ""beginning of time"" montage that starts the film is beautiful; roaming shots of the Icelandic countryside and angry waterfalls wash over you as the score tries to soothe you in a way that feels like it's trying to mislead you. It's as if it's trying to say, ""There there, it'll be alright,"" and pats you softly on the hand like a caring grandmother before turning around in the next scene and growing to its peak as something horrific takes place on screen that wasn't expected mere moments ago.

Everything is awe-inspiring to look at. One of the reasons for that is that Scott tried to use as little CGI in the film as possible (although there are over 1300 digital VFX shots) and mostly stuck to computer generated shots being used in space. If you're not blown away by the scenery, their exploration of the planet's surface and what that leads to, or the incredible shots in space, the technology they use in the film is beyond astounding; Reacting with holograms, 3D maps that can be accessed with the swipe of a finger, and an android capable of doing things some people only dream of is only scratching the surface.

Where do we come from? Who are our makers? Will we still trust our faith when we find the answers? These are the questions ""Prometheus"" explores in its story. You also have a pretty great idea of just what the heck a Space Jockey is by the time ""Prometheus"" ends. The thing is that if you go into this expecting a straight shooting ""Alien"" prequel, you'll more than likely be disappointed. There are definitely nods to it and parts of the film play out similarly to ""Alien,"" but this is more like taking place in the same universe as ""Alien"" and more of an indirect prequel. That quote Ridley Scott gave about this ""having 'Alien' DNA,"" is extremely accurate.

""Prometheus"" isn't perfect. It may be really slow moving for some. It takes its sweet time establishing its atmosphere and you may be left wanting a bit more action. Patient viewers who can sit still and admire dialogue and a solid story will be rewarded while trigger happy viewers will more than likely get antsy. The ending, although somewhat satisfying, is mostly just this huge tease. If a sequel isn't made, we should probably riot; although, with repeat viewings, it's less of a problem.

The biggest issue people may have is that technology seems so much more advanced in the past than in the future. ""Prometheus"" mostly takes place in 2093 while ""Alien"" takes place in 2122. You also have to keep in mind that the Prometheus is a more advanced ship than the Nostromo, a towing vessel; more of a grunt ship. So the argument could go either way.

Repeat viewings also leave you with more questions. The main one being why did the atmosphere have such an altering affect on the ampule room yet didn't affect the cargo hold at all?

""Prometheus"" is really freaking superb on one hand. Its cast is ridiculous and every one of them delivers, the visuals are fantastic, and the storyline is mostly incredibly enthralling. Imagine being a film critic who's used to taking notes throughout the duration of a film, but during ""Prometheus"" you were so absorbed in it that you didn't write anything down other than the title. That's kind of a big deal.

On the other hand, something more definitive seems like it would have been more gratifying. With stakes so high that define what we, as humans, actually are, an open ending leaving room for a sequel feels like a bit of a cop out. ""Prometheus"" is still spectacular and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott is back in top form, but ""Prometheus"" suffers from pulling (and relying on) the strings of anticipation a bit too much."
1163,2.0,"Visually pretty, for sure, but what a lame story.  I just don't agree that this story is worthy of 5 stars.  Really?  5 stars?  How?

I just don't get it, won't recommend it, and certainly will never waste my time watching it again.  Once again, two stars only, and I mean only, because it was visualy appealing.  But the plot and movie stunk."

1166,5.0,"I don't like zombie movies, but I freaking love this series. It's not about the zombies, people; it's about the characters and how they survive in this zombie infested world! Plus - SPOILERS - Shane dies and that was good news for me!"
1167,3.0,"Why you shouldn't see it:

Not to give away too much about this particular movie, but... it drags at parts. While it doesn't necessarily feel any longer than its two hour runtime, it does feel every minute of it. Have you ever watched a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat? Well, neither have I, but I've now seen half of a movie that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. I understand there's another movie - titled, coincidentally enough, Lifeboat - that takes place entirely on a lifeboat. Maybe someday I'll watch that Hitchcock piece, but until then I'll have to settle for this particular lifeboat-centric movie. Okay, okay, I have exaggerated slightly how much of this movie takes place on a lifeboat. The parts of the movie that take place on the lifeboat aren't technically entirely on the lifeboat, as there is also the 20-or-so-foot radius of open water around the lifeboat where some action also takes place. So there's that.

This one actually reminds me a fair amount of Cast Away in that the majority of the movie leans heavily on the ability of a single character to engage the audience's interest while he does nothing more than try to survive in extraordinary circumstances. The problem with that comparison is that Suraj Sharma is no Tom Hanks (full disclosure: I have an almost creepy respect for Tom Hanks' acting chops, so I may be biased here). While the latter half of Cast Away thrives on Hanks' ability to make otherwise mundane onscreen moments incredibly intriguing, Life of Pi just doesn't have as strong a feature actor to revolve its survival story around.

Strangely, some of the more dragging parts of the movie happen before Pi ever fatefully sets foot on a boat. Since the story isn't so much about a lifeboat as it is about a boy and the man that boy becomes, there's the sometimes regrettable necessity of building a backstory about where this person is coming from. It's hard to explain, but there is just something about this backstory that doesn't hold my attention nearly as well as others (for example, Cast Away). As a general rule, I spent a fair amount of the first half of the movie wondering things like, ""When are they getting on the boat?"", ""Why are they not on the boat yet?"", ""Why do Indians wiggle their heads like that when they talk? Do they think it conveys any message to the listener other than induced confusion?"", and, ""Wait, does this movie even have a boat in it?""

Why you should see it:

Perhaps above I didn't mention a fairly big (literally and figuratively) additional character in the movie, specifically in the lifeboat: an adult male Bengal tiger. The tiger has a name, but I won't spoil that for you, and I will just refer to it here as ""tiger."" So anyway, what you thought was going to be a nice, laid back, somewhat boring adventure on a lifeboat turns out to be, in fact, a second-by-second struggle for survival against a freaking Bengal tiger. In case you're not as familiar as I am with Bengal tigers, just know that they average 500 pounds and are considered to be the most aggressive subspecies of an animal that is known to occasionally eat people.

Tiger has a funny name in the movie, and I will give credit to the author and screenwriter for occasionally adding in appropriate moments of humor and everyday humanity into an extraordinary coming of age story. If it hadn't been for the occasional giggle moments in the first half of the movie, I'm not sure I would have made it to the second half. Well, that's an exaggeration, since I'm pretty thoroughly stubborn when it comes to finishing movies, and even more so when it comes to best picture nominees. Still, suffice it to say that there wasn't much to hold my attention for the first hour.

All that being said, there is really one main reason that anyone would want to see Life of Pi, and that reason has everything to do with an appreciation for visual art. Once the film reaches the boat, nearly every frame of the movie one could take, frame, and put it up on his or her wall. The visuals are stimulating not only due to the fact that they include crystal clear detail and vivid, saturated colors, but they also depict images that are not frequently seen. You may not be aware, but an adult male Bengal tiger does not often chill out on a lifeboat playing with flying fish in the middle of the ocean. Even in little moments, Lee finds ways to create visual art out of his material. When the opening credits are rolling over footage of a small Indian zoo, the words on the screen behave like the animals on the screen. Sometimes it's the little things.

In Short:

Life of Pi is visually breathtaking at moments and beautiful for the rest of it. If you have interest in seeing it and aren't opposed to the whole 3D phenomenon, I recommend it as a readily available way to suck you even further into the visuals Lee has created. The story drags at parts for me, and but for the payoff at the end (which I won't spoil for you), I would be happy to write the whole thing off as eye candy and nothing more. But that payoff is there, and as a consequence I've been thinking about it since I saw it almost a week ago. If it weren't for the occasional slowness of the movie itself, I would rate it higher, but for now I'll settle at a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anyone who likes pretty things and/or exploring the nature of storytelling.

Exceptions to the recommendation:
- anyone who would prefer to believe that there is no beauty in the world;
- people who are frightened by adult male Bengal tigers (just kidding, because that should really be anyone/everyone, and I'm not going to recommend that no one see this movie just because of a healthy respect for one's own mortality when near that particular ornery feline);
- militant atheists... I guess I should have mentioned somewhere that this story is set up as proof that God exists and has a fair amount to do with religion... oops;
- racists (who aren't Indian);
- homophobes who want to stick it to Ang Lee (figuratively) for daring to make a movie about gays (this movie doesn't have any gays to my knowledge, but I figure sticking it to Lee for Brokeback Mountain by not watching Life of Pi makes about as much sense as homophobia in general);
- people who don't like irrational numbers."
1168,2.0,"It's mainly about a bunch of individuals in the middle of a war who are unable to get over their petty differences and simply get along with each other.  They all end up killing each other with their own stupidity.  Why have people in your zombie fighting group who can't be trusted?  Then there is the backstory about stumbling zombies who apparently are able to move at a consistent 15 MPH.  Just have some zombie rules and follow them.  They're stumbling and they walk really slow, so follow that one freaking rule at least.  Show some consistency.  We find out that apparently everyone is a carrier and Rick held it from the group (seems like this would be really relevant given his wife is pregnant with a possible zombie baby).  The CDC guy informed them of this which is odd because he was following all the CDC protocol to avoid exposure to the disease.  Please don't try explaining it...it is just stupid.  Then some other group wants to take over their farm because apparently, there aren't enough empty farms to be found in the country during a zombie apocalypse, and it is necessary to take stuff from people.  Instead of hitting up Walmart for supplies they go into a town with lots of buildings and hit a tiny pharmacy that isn't very secure.  Their zombies are less intelligent than buffalo, and yet they can't figure out how to kill masses of them.  Finally, one would think they would use some strategy in fighting the zombies and secure the perimeter, but nope, none of that stuff....just hold up in a farm next to some woods.  They don't even give any thought to weapons.  Nobody bothers with a silencer of any kind, and instead of using weapons like oh a baseball bat, a long machette, or a samurai sword, their weapons of choice are screwdrivers and knives that result in lots of blood getting sprayed all over them.  Writers should have watched Zombieland a few times.  Should I even mention trying to drive a ancient Winnebago across the country in a post apocalyptic world?  Oh, and what the heck is with them coveting a crappy book?  Did libraries, book stores, book shelves, etc go away in their post apocalyptic world?"
1169,3.0,"Season 2 had it's moments like the Shane/Otis incident, the Sophia incident, the Dale incident, the Rick/Shane incident and the outstanding freaking awesome finale with the appearance of Mishonne and the finale scene of the camera panning to show the prison BUT I thought the season as a whole was a little sluggish compared to the kick ass Season One.  I realize the shows producers were establishing characters and that's important to story telling so I'm not complaining.  TWD has to be the BEST television series ever.  It is gruesome, compelling, disgusting, gory, well written, character driven with a dose of wonderful zombies thrown in for good measure and who doesn't love zombies?  The blood and guts is pretty graphic at times (just remind yourself the zombies aren't really tearing away at human flesh, that's nylons they're chomping away at) so the series isn't for the feint of heart but if you're into heavy duty carnage and adrenaline fueled excitement, this series doesn't disappoint.  At the end of season 2 Rick has become glorious Ricktator and I'm pumped to see what direction he leads the group -- and what members of the group will follow.  I'm a huge fan of Glen so (not having followed the graphic novels) I'm hoping Glen sticks around.  Can't  wait for Season 3!!!"
1170,5.0,"Dark, deranged, twisted and sick and I loved every freaking moment of it. These people are the strangest on earth they do things to each other you would never believe. It begins with an attractive couple a psychiatrist his wife and teenage daughter moving into a beautiful old house with a dark history. Their first day there they meet their next door neighbor played byJessica Lange who comes looking for her autistic daughter who has a creepy uncanny knack for getting into the house

After settling in slowly bizzar things begin to happen and as the story goes on the history of the houses previous owners through the years is discovered shocking things a murder among other things. The first owner was a doctor who built the house for his wife and the path he chose to follow is indeed horrific and beyond imagining ,

The new owners are trying to start over after the loss of their unborn child, he has a strange assortment of psychiatric patients one is a charming kind hearted teenage boy with a creepy connection to the old house. Later on the wife finds out she is pregnant and the couple is ecstatic about it and happily start preparing for the new arrival

As hidden secrets are brought to light the young doctors dark secret comes out. Then there is a guy dressed in one of those black rubber S&M outfits with a ski mask like hood on it sneaking around their home scaring others and later on does that lead to a mind blowing surprise. Jessica Lange's character also has a connection to house and was involved in something tragic that took place in the past. I don't want to give anything away and spoil it for others but this is an amazing series, I thought after season 1 this could not possibly get any scarier but season 2 and 3 are proved me wrong and even darker than season 1. Season 4 is really creepy I rented episode 1 of it and it is really good, American Horror story just keeps getting better and better. Angela Bassett fans will be glad to know she stars in Seasons 3 and 4 as Marie Levaue the famous voodoo queen"
1171,2.0,"I really cannot believe what they have done to this show. It really seems like AMC and its set of unsophisticated, juvenile writers have their heart set on ruining this show by process of elimination of one important character at a time. Last week we saw Dale, a relatively major and regular cast member who provided an important dynamic to the group, be killed off in the most outlandish way (a zombie opening up his chest cavity with his bare hands, yeah right), and this week Shane, a principal cast member, was also booted off the show.

AMC should just cancel the show. They ruined it. Killing off Shane was an even more epic mistake than killing off Dale. Shows rarely recover from such major cast changes. Yes I know, in the comics, Shane dies pretty early on. But

1) the show has already deviated quite substantial from the comics anyway and
2) Shane was a regular cast member and the audience had established a connection to him. He was a major player. Killing off major characters like that is demoralizing.

So killing him this late on was a huge mistake and I don't think people realize how much his absence will be felt as the show continues. It will change everything.

Personally, I don't care much for following this past season 2. I might take a peek out of curiosity every now and then but this show is done for me. Shane was a central figure - controversial or not and the writers just turned his character into a caricature.

Word has it that Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale) left the show because AMC fired Darabont and he just didn't want anything to do with the show anymore and that Jon Bernthal (Shane) left for the same reason. In fact, Bernthal has been cast in Darabont's next TV project, ""L.A. Noir"". So it seems like the writers messed it up for everyone so badly by firing the head creative mind followed by lousy writing and the direction they took the show in general, that now half the cast are leaving voluntarily. Next week more will be killed off; personally I am betting on T-Dog, Hershel and Carol but it wouldnt surprise me if they offed Glenn too.

This show should have been about the adventure and this disease and trying to find answers as well as surviving, traversing the landscape marred by the apocalypse. Darabont set it up masterfully: dark, and sad and sinister. When Amy died and turned, the transformation was tragic and sad and it had resonance. They didn't even do that with Shane, it was just rushed and he turned almost instantly. It's like they couldn;t get it over with fast, to finish up in the time allotted.

The writers, after Darabont's departure, have degraded this show to soap opera level with lousy writing. Some drama and tragedy is good (like in season one) as it humanizes the show, but this show has become just that, a drama. Zombies and the zombie apocalypse have become the mere incidental backdrop.

Rick saw a helicopter in season one, but we don't know what happened and he never mentioned it again and no one ever asked again. If the world had come to an end and I saw a helicopter in the sky I would have hope that there is something left and ask questions and purse, instead of hanging out on little house on the prairie bickering with my best friend over some woman.

+ WHY IS THAT KID UNSUPERVISED? Over and over again, he just pops up in a scene. I mean since Lori gave Andrea a lecture on how to be a good doormat of a woman, she just got the award for the worst freaking mother EVER for letting her son wander around the zombie-overrun world unsupervised. Is this a joke?

+I liked how no one was phased about Dale's death. Maybe with the exception of Glenn, everyone just sort of went about their business like nothing of proportions happened. Andrea, from what I gather in the comics, was shattered at Dale, whom she was close to, dying but here she just had this dumb grin on her face like ""oh well, things happen"".

+ Very stealthy of both the readers and Shane to drag Rick into the open field to kill him.

+ This episode, much like the last and half a dozen before it, is not about zombies and end of the world. They are about two Alphas stuck in a ""how long is my ding dong"" contest and the entire show has been just about that; which contributed to the complete and utter destruction of Shane's character into nothing but a caricature and stereotype of the psycho Alpha.

Apparently the term Walking Dead refers to the living, not to the dead. In this episode it is somehow established, in the finest tradition of vague and incoherent story telling these writers are accustomed to,  that whatever that virus is that turns you, has apparently infected everyone, the living, so that now everyone turns, even if they were were not bit. If that is true, then why didn't we see that anywhere in the show (except for 2 episodes ago)? They spent the whole first season showing how people who get bit, and bit only, develop the symptoms such as getting a fever and dying. Not ONCE did they ever show an incidence that it was otherwise. We saw dead bodies on the highway that had not turned; now suddenly the dead turn without a bite. That doesn't make sense and it's called continuity or lack thereof.

The assumption is that the virus mutated and that this is what Jenner told Rick. But that also doesn't make sense. Why would Jenner withhold that info from everyone except for Rick. I mean why wouldnt he just tell  everyone that they are infected? He told them everything else; in fact, he had them under lock up and tried to convince them to die. This information would have served beautifully in that capacity. I mean, what's in it for him to lie anyway? That just doesnt makes sense and the only way it makes sense is that the writers are in fact just making this up as they go along - which evidently is what has been happening since they fired Darabont.

With regard to Shane: instead of keeping the differences in opinion between Rick and Shane to a manageable level and expanding on it, so as to keep the antagonism with regard to how to approach the post apocalypse, they turned this how into this stagy, melodramatic love triangle and Shane into American Psycho, ruining his character.

The thing is, Shane's character provided an important aspect and tension to the show. He was the guy who seemed headstrong, having gotten a little carried away given the totally desperate situation they are in (this is the zombie Apocalypse after all, we'd all lose it), but he was also strong and made sense and the audience was split, some agreed with him, some didn't, reflecting exactly the kinds of dilemmas these people were facing as a group: make an attempt to keep our humanity or stay strong and adhere to the no nonsense attitude Shane was advocating to survive. When Shane insisted they give up searching for the girl, audiences agreed. He was believable, he made sense. Remember Shane was shocked seeing Sophia come out of the barn, he consoled Carol after Sophia's demise, he did feel bad when he shot Otis to get away. He had humanity, which they stripped off him for no good reason. And instead of continuing to keep his character complicated like that, they went overboard and turned him into a psycho who was about to murder his childhood and best friend over a stupid woman. Huge fail.

There is such a thing called consistency within a plot dear AMC writers. You cant just make characters, in a span of 10 days, act out of character like that and make a 180 degree turn. Shane's character was not a sociopath. He had rough edges but he had compassion too.

I am gravely disappointed with how this show has turned out. AMC should continue on its path of crappy cheapness, as they did with this show by keeping the cast on the same place for the whole season and firing the creative head talent, and just cancel the show.

There is a lot of serious narrative fail in not only this episode but throughout the second season and I think people are starting to feel the void of Frank Darabont and his masterful storytelling. The network and the crappy, cheap writing has literally driven away most of the actors."
1172,5.0,freakingly awesome. Jessica lange is incredible.
1173,5.0,"When I first heard of Revenge, I thought it was another ABC failed attempt to rise back to the top.  But when I watched the first episode, I was hooked and I bought the whole season on DVD.  The result: it is one of the best tv shows I have ever watched.

The whole story is about a woman, who comes back to her family-home in the Hamptons and is looking to lay her past to rest.... literally.  The woman's name is Emily Thorne, but her real name is Amanda Clarke, and has returned to get revenge (title reference) on those who framed her father for a crime he didn't commit.  While searching to gain vengeance, Emily (or Amanda, whatever she likes to be called) runs into people from her past and also sets a series of events that will affect everything and everyone.

The summary sounds like it lays everything out in front of you and you think that you have the whole thing figured out.  Well, if you do think that, you are wrong.  This story is planned out way bigger than the summary lets you believe.  Yes, it is about revenge, but it way more than that.  I'll review a little bit more and I promise to try to keep my spoilers to minimum.

I really do love this first season of the series.  It was well-paced, well-written, fun to watch, exciting, and even sexy as hell.  The whole storyline starts off fresh (in its own way) and starts to build up towards a lot of things.  We are introduced to a lot of characters (who I will talk about in a little bit) and we also are given explanations to a ton of stuff.  We learn to what really happened to Amanda's father, David Clarke, and why he was imprisoned.  We also learn some really exciting secrets along the way.  One of which you will not see coming and will definitely leave you speechless and shocked (foreshadowing episode 12, ""Infamy"").

As for the characters, they are done really well.  The main protagonist, Emily Thorne (real name, Amanda Clarke) is not exactly the type of girl who you would call ""nice"" or ""thoughtful"", at least when you are the one being targeted by her.  Emily is a troubled woman, who is out of revenge and doesn't care about anything or anyone (which we see change over the course of the season).  While it looks like she happy on the outside, you can quickly tell that she completely the opposite on the inside.  We also have Victoria Grayson (the main villain of the story), a woman who has a more troubled past than Emily.  Victory is portrayed as a deadly woman, who knows how to make threats with a single smile.  Unlike Emily, Victoria is filled with regret for the things she has done (a small reference to certain betrayal).  We also have the great Nolan Ross, who Emily's closest and most loyal friend.  Nolan is more of the comic relief of the story and also the backup for Emily's plan for revenge.  Trust me, Nolan will bring out a few laughs out of you.  There is Jack Porter, who is a certain person from Emily's past and (sort of) a love interest to her as well.  We also meet Jack's little brother, Declan (who I swear looks like a more younger version of Orlando Bloom), who plays the love interest to a girl named Charlotte Grayson, who is the daughter of Victoria.  Keep in mind that Charlotte plays a big role for the season.  We also have Daniel Grayson, who is the son of Victoria and also Emily's second love interest in the season.  Daniel is more of the ""innocent"" boy who is looking to do something with his life and not have to be part of the Grayson family business.  And finally, we have Conrad Grayson, the husband to Victoria and father to both Daniel and Charlotte.  Conrad is the secondary villain of the series and plays a great role as well.  If there is one thing funnier than Nolan himself, it is the conversations between him and Victoria (trust me).  There are tons of other characters who play big roles in this story as well, but I think the series does a better job at introducing and explaining them.

Sense we are talking about revenge, this series really does live up to the title and the expectations that comes with it.  ""Everything"" is almost about revenge.  Emily's motives are for revenge and so is her commitment to it.  Her everyday life and thoughts is pretty much revenge.  Not only that, but some other characters get revenge as well.  Somewhere along the way, we see someone getting back at someone who did wrong to them.  People may be think that this series goes to far, but if you actually watch the series, you will understand why Emily and others do what they have to do.  Especially Emily.  Out of all of the people in this series, Emily has the right to do what she has to do.  Her perfect life and father was taken away from her and she spent the rest of her life in a living hell.  The little girl who smiled and loved everything was killed when her father was framed and put in prison for a crime he didn't commit.  Heck, even after he was arrest Emily was going through a living hell of her own.  The nightmare was everlasting for Emily.  It left a huge impact on her and it looks like it will never go away.  If you truly want to understand why she wants revenge, just watch the freaking series and find out.  With me, I agree with Emily and say that she needs to do it.  I know I couldn't live on or have peace, knowing that the people who did evil are living like there is no tomorrow.  I believe that if justice can't be served, then revenge has to be.

As for the ending, I won't say much about it.  I can't go heavily into it without revealing a few spoilers (if not all of them).  But I can say this, it ends on a high note and also reveals one more secret that leaves you wanting more.  In fact, this secret that comes with it is not even seen coming.  The ending was satisfying and leaves a lot of room for season two.  If you want to find out, you have to watch it, that is all I'm going to say.

If you do think about it, Revenge feels more like a Count of Monte Cristo story.  It has the revenge story feeling and also that dark atmosphere that the novel had.  Not to mention that Amanda comes back with a new name and a lot of money, which she uses to get revenge on the rich (or those who framed her father).  That sounds a whole lot like Edmond Dantes to me.  If you read the story, then you can see the connection.  Also, some of the small time villains fit the description of a few villains from the novel too.  I do consider this series to be inspired by the Count of Monte Cristo and believe that it almost lives up to it as well.

Is this a tv series that you would be interested in?  Well, if you like revenge stories and twists and turns, then I would say ""yes"".  But if you are the forgiving type and aren't really interested in vengeance, then I would say ""maybe not"".  Truth is, this is not a story about forgiveness.  Even Emily herself says this in the beginning and end of the first episode.  There is no forgiveness and no salvation, just revenge and darkness.  My personal opinion, I love revenge storylines and dark stories.  They always seem to make better stories and they seem to have something for everyone.

I really do love this series and I highly recommend it for anyone.  It will shock you from beginning to end and will never once let you go to sleep without wondering happens next.  I say buy it and watch it with friends or family.  Heck, watch it with both!  Enjoy it and just have a great time!

Revenge Season One is the best!"
1174,2.0,"A friend of mine who is a comic buff told  me that he stopped reading the comics after a while because they became increasingly more ""soap opera"" like and about characters and their feelings and relationships and less and less about the zombie apocalypse, immediate survival, the question of how it all happened and the end of the world. So I am afraid this show is headed in that direction as well. Already as it is, everything we have seen so far in this season, with the exception of the very first episode and then this episode, have been heading in that direction and if the intention of the writers is to make this show about some psychological expos  of its characters with the apocalypse and zombies thrown in there as the incidental backdrop, I am afraid it will be just downhill from there. I am sure lots of people are interested in that kind of story line but I think for those of us who are looking for more the disappointment is impending. I, for one, am certainly not interested in a series that studies how people act under pressure. That's just too easy.

Having to wait 6 episodes to get some much needed plot reward is not a great TV show maker, it is a sure recipe for impending cancellation.

That said, this episode should have been the third episode in the whole bunch instead of drawing things out painfully long for four or five episodes to get to this. They seriously need to take the direction away from the characters' mostly petty interpersonal relationships and strike a balance with regard to  character development and trying to answer some of the tough questions like they did in Season One when they went to the CDC. I still don't understand why throwing in one of the oldest cliches in soap opera history, like the pregnancy and ""who is the father of my child?"" could possibly be considered clever and intelligent plot elements.

The way they have portrayed most of the characters in this season has made liking them increasingly difficult. With the exception of Shane and Andrea maybe, everyone there is out of their freaking minds.

First you got Dale whose preferred method of dealing with conflict of any kind is brushing it under the carpet. After first taking the gun away from Andrea and then later lying about the car being fixed so they could not move on, he now, quite cleverly, decides to hide ALL guns the group owns, so Shane cant get to them; nevermind that they are surrounded by walkers. Of course Shane is the bad guy for asking him to return them.

Then you have Rick, who appears to have suspended all reason, negotiate in all seriousness with that nut job Hershel about staying on the farm indefinitely in exchange for helping him rescue Walkers. Wow. Did he really think that they could all stay on little house on the prairie with the world gone under, a myriad of unanswered questions (see CDC from season 1) and over a dozen zombies in the barn and days filled with plowing fields and rescuing Walkers here and there? Seriously? It's also only been a week or so since he awoke from his coma. Isnt it too early to settle down already and throw in the towel? Shouldnt they be looking for answers instead of wasting their time worrying about Lori's rate of sexual intercourse and status of reproductive organs?

Finally, the little boy got more dialog and screen time than TDog and Daryl has gone from the violent, yet courageous,  boondock trash who was willing to blow everyone's brains out at the drop of a hat to sentimental, mooshy and sappy around Carol, who seems a little too old for him and whom he affectionately calls a ""stupid b*tch"". Huge turn off. Calling an abused woman abusive names totally made me dislike Daryl.

Shane's character is quite interesting. He seems to have had those violent and angry tendencies all along actually, only that they were sort of kept in check under the thin veneer of civilization and the rules, laws and mores that govern it. Now, all of a sudden with all those structures, if you so will, no longer in place, those traits in him keep peaking through and manifesting. I don't think he is a sociopath or even an evil and callous person like most people here like ot say. I highly doubt that if he was in pre-zombie apocalypse world, he would have shot another human being, like he did with Otis, to save himself. But in a world that's been taken over by flesh eating zombies, the same rules don't apply anymore. They can't apply or you'll die. It was either him (and with him Carl) or Otis. Keeping your humanity is important but it can really only go so far if you want to survive. Shane's deterioration as the result of the meltdown in the world is quite interesting.

Shane is still the most reasonable if you ask me and i think Rick's behavior would have gotten them killed, but you can see his mask of sanity slowly slipping and that is intriguing. I hope the writers keep the nuances and ambiguity there instead of following some trite clichee and turn him totally evil.

One of the strength of this show was that unlike most zombie movies, this looked at the humanity of it all, portraying the fate human kind was facing as tragic, illuminating the sadness of a world torn by disease. Those scenes in the first season where Morgan's child struggles because his mother has become a Walker, when Amy turns or where they have to abandon Jim who was bitten, were beautifully executed and powerful. Amid all the insanity we were reminded that the biggest tragedy is that every single human being has been ravaged and killed by illness and reanimated into nothing but a monstrous, animated corpse forever doomed to wander the world in an undead, mindless daze in what is to be the zombie apocalypse. This dilemma was central to the story line and created an unparalleled mood and somberness. Season 2, on the other hand, let the air out slowly and painfully and now, with the exception of this a couple of episodes, it has flattened out, like Lori' s chest and personality.

This show has gone from one about survival and the adventure within an unexpectedly terrifying setting to one about the interpersonal relationships of the remaining survivors. How about those iconic shots of cities and roads that are completely empty and where the signs of the apocalypse are the only things that mar the landscape like overturned cars, wrecked buildings, fires, and dead bodies?

The aftermath of the chaos, the silence, and the blank canvas of the landscape - especially city - created a suspenseful atmosphere in the first season, drawing you in and wanting you to know more about how all this happened, what is left, where the scientific community is, how other cities and countries dealt with it etc.

I don't see this show taking on a meaningful direction, however, to parallel what we have seen in Season 1, anytime soon, if they continue on the same path writing wise. It certainly is a shame. They should never have let Darabont go."
1175,1.0,"This show has utterly lost its way, the suspense and action of the first season is completely lost.
Sad- I thought it would grow more intense after the first season. QUestions to ask- have any major characters been killed by the walkers so far in 6 episodes this whole season?! None. Not one, they go out from the farm, occasionally encoutner a situation and then come back. And the retarded farmer vet, with his barn full of zombies, seriously you have got to be kidding me? I know he is a ""Religous"" man and killing is wrong for him, but come on.
I will give this show one, just one MORE episode to blow my mind, and if it doesn't it, that is it.
This has devolved into a freaking soap opera, with what looks like not much budget spent on these episodes either."
1176,3.0,"*Spoilers Ahead*

I really cant help but compare this season to the breathtaking and phenomenal season one. Whereas in Season 1 I felt that I had to suspend disbelief only minimally, I see myself having to do that now a lot. Some have already mentioned some of the inconsistencies that have overall contributed to diminishing the quality of the show.

One of course is the whole trying to pull the zombie out of the well thing. I mean first, Dale stops the other dude from drinking the water, saying it is contaminated when he finds out the zombie is in there. Then, they risk someone's life, i.e. Glenn's, to take the zombie out on grounds that leaving it there might contaminate the water? Also, while on the one hand they argue with each other about not taking unnecessary risks, here they are willing to risk one of their best men to take out a zombie that had already contaminated the well so it doesnt contaminate the well? It didn't make sense. It seemed to me that the well zombie segment was inserted in there more as a show of a cool zombie effect rather than because it really fit the story. It is as if they wanted that gory special in there and wrote the story around it.

And what is that with the church scene? I don't remember if it was in this episode or the previous one but it was one thing that truly bothered me: that whole scene where first Carol and then Grimes sit there and whine and plead, pray and sob to the cross was so sappy and tacky. Oh my god. I couldn't believe they blew so much screen time on that. I mean let's forget for a second that you would have to be seriously insane and in complete and utter denial to believe in any kind of religious stuff or divine providence when the freaking ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE has befallen the Earth, but to seriously make that one of the plot elements with the secret message being that maybe there is something divine after all, was so inappropriate for this show, not to mention sappy.

And whats up with the men all holding the weapons and determining which little woman can keep hers. That's ridiculous. They keep saying they cant have it because they have no training, but who cares? The world has come to an end for cryin' out loud;  these people live life like someone was holding a knife to their throats and they are at the risk of being attacked by an insane freak at any moment. Everyone, except the kids, needs to carry a gun and not ask for permission, especially when they are wandering through the woods filled with zombies. And then even that is obviously biased, because Lori got to have one last episode because she is Rick's wife even though she is as trained in shooting as Andrea or Carol.

Another thing that truly bothered me is how careless these people are. This is a world that has gone under and the deranged undead are lurking in every corner, and neither Lori or Carol really watch for their kids. In the first episode of the season when they were stranded on the road blocked with cars, they just wander amid the cars and Lori and Carol let the kids walk around on their own. Later when they go looking for Sophia, Carl asks if he can go stating that ""they need all the men they can get to cover as much ground as possible"". Yes, kid, all the MEN, not little boys. And then Lori actually says ""I don't know. Ask your dad, I cant always be the bad guy"" as if she was debating whether she should let her kid go to Magic Mountain instead of on a zombie hunt:  for crissake by_ch you are about to send your kid out into woods deluged by the insane undead, he isn't going to the state fair or planning to go on throw up rides. I couldn't believe they let him go. So of course when he was shot, it was hard ot feel sympathy for them -they should never have let the kid go.

Everything since they left the CDC is drawn out. I think this is all supposed to be taking place in a 48 hour period but it is so drawn out that it feels like they have been there for a week. I know they are waiting for Carl to get better too but their main mission still seems to be to find the girl and at this point it seems just a little crazy and out of touch with reality for them to be looking for a girl abandoned in the woods filled with zombies. Do they seriously think they are actually going to find her. ?

Anyway these are just a few of the inconsistencies that are starting to really bug me. Otherwise great show - even though I wish they were bringing back more of the bleakness of the first season and stopped with all the sentimentalities and sappy sub-plots."
1177,3.0,"Okay, I just want to say, this movie was freaking ""badass"" and I really mean that!  ""Roadblock"" (The Rock), ""Commander Colton"" (Bruce Willis), and ""Snake Eyes"" (whoever plans Snake Eyes) deliver the most action-packed film ever!

The only downside I hated about this movie, is that Channing Tatum's character, Duke, is killed off at the very beginning, just like everyone else.  After surviving huge next-generation starships, master assassins, Rex (aka Cobra Commander), Destro, and nanomites, he is killed by a simple explosion, leaving all the work to his best pal to stop Cobra.  That was the biggest mistake in the film.  The very reason it has three stars!

But despite Duke's death, the movie has turned out to be amazing film and a great sequel to the first G.I. Joe movie.  The Rock and Bruce Willis bring out great characters and do their best to save the world.  Along with pretty familiar characters and a good storyline, our heroes are back to deliver one awesome take down on Cobra!

The first film will always be my favorite, but to those who say this movie sucked, it actually wasn't bad.  I mean, we have Snake Eyes back and The Rock taking the lead now.  Yes, Duke dies and Storm Shadow's story gets confusing, but the movie was pretty good.  The fight scenes were badass and the characters were amazing.  But as always, the first film was better and nothing will change that.

I recommend this movie if you can handle the death of Duke and be preparing for a sequel.  ;)"
1178,1.0,"There are films that ask you to accept the premise before going in. There are movies that ask you to accept certain plot elements though they don't make sense. There are movies that ask you to shut your mind off and just go with the idiocy going on on screen. And then there is GI Joe. Nothing makes sense in this film. Not a single solitary thing. There's really nothing more I can say about it. It isn't suspension of belief that this movie asks of you, but the utter ejection of your brain into a little jar which you might hopefully get back when you walk away. I'm sorry, I couldn't do it. I just couldn't do it. Once, a long time ago, I could. I still remember being very entertained by the first Transformers, so obviously suspension of belief to this level was possible for me at some time in my life, but I just can't do it anymore.

The movie starts with a GI Joe par core fight scene, which I guess was supposed to be exiting but all I could thing about was The Office.

[...]

It really is that ridiculous. But to be fair, this is standard popcorn action stuff. I can forgive a movie its sins of over the top action, I have in the past, I will probably do it in the future. But the action in this movie never really excited me at any point. I can enjoy dumb action as much as the next guy (hell, I think I'm the only one in the world who liked Die Hard 4 after all), but GI Joe's was just too... Transformy. And not in the Transformer 1 kinda way, more like in the ""what in the name of God is going on here?"" Transformer's two kinda way. A small difference, I know, but even those who enjoy the first Transformers as a guilty pleasure want to rip our heads off at the idiocy that is the second movie. Transformers 1=stupid fun, while Transformers 2="" my God what did I just see?"" That's pretty much how I felt at the end of this film. A lot of bullets are thrown around, a lot of explosions, and a lot of crazy over the top action slock. But just about everything in it defines all sense of logic and reason to the point where I think the movie was written by the special effects people instead of, well, you know, actual writers. Did Michael Bay do this movie? No? Well riddle me surprised.

But it's not the crazy over the top action that does this movie in. Despite my bad mouthing it, there were a couple of scenes I have to admit were really freaking cool. No siry, it's the complete lack of sense. Spoilers follow, so if you care about such things, cover your virgin eyes. So Cobra's plan to take over the world is, upon installing one of his henchmen as the fake President, to assassinate the Joe's with a massive military strike against their base after framing them for the assassination of the Pakistani President after using them to steal all of Pakistan's nukes which are conveniently all located in one central location guarded by people wearing towels (and no, that's not a racist remark, one of the dudes is literally wearing a towel on his head). So they launch a massive strike against the Joes... and no one ever questions the logic behind this, asks why the attempt was never made to capture and try them, question the President's authority to straight up kill all the Joe's using (ahem) COBRA troops. Did none of the generals wonder who all those mysterious troops were? So once the Joe's are out of the way the next step in the plan is to gather together in one spot the leaders of every nuclear armed nation in the world in order to negotiate talks on nuclear disbarment. Once there he, launches his nukes at all of them? Okay, first off, North Korea is at these talks. What fantasy world is this? North Korea sitting down at the negotiating table to talk about nuclear disbarment? Balderdash! So the nations of the world respond by, launching every single nuke they have, AT EACH OTHER? Wait a minute, they weren't nuking each other, America was nuking them, why then would they nuke each other in response? So the fake President then destroys all his nukes with a magical button, an watches as all the other world leaders have similar magical buttons that destroy their nukes midair as well. But wait, what if one of them decided not to? What if, you know, North Korea or Iran decided, screw it, and let their missiles destroy America anyway? Then Cobra would be dead, and the whole plan would be for nothing. Yeah, way to go Cobra.

END SPOILERS!
You see, no logic. There are so many plot holes in this movie it might as well be Swiss cheese. Nothing in this movie makes sense. There's a part where a character takes out a handful of grenades he was hiding in a fruit bowl, a FRUIT BOWL. Golly, sure hope he doesn't have any company over for dinner. Wouldn't want any kid finding a freaking grenade while looking for a banana. I haven't mentioned a quarter of the huge gaping holes in this movie, and I think just the ones I listed are pretty bad.

The acting is adequate for this kind of movie though nothing special. The Rock puts in a fun performance, while everyone else is... well, there. Bruce Willis was an odd character. He didn't really do much, just sort of gave the Joe's their guns for the final battle and helped out a little bit in that battle, but he is more of an extended cameo then an actual character. I mean it's still Bruce Willis, so you know he's a cool guy,  but it seemed like a role they threw in there to give the movie a little extra star power it didn't have before.

So in conclusion, GI Joe is Transformers 2. Is it better than the first? I don't know, as I've never seen the first. Is it entertaining in its own right? That all depends on the level of BS you can take before giving up on a movie. I was somewhat with this movie all the way up to the point where the villains revealed their master plan, at that point I couldn't take it anymore. It had reached levels of ridiculousness m fragile little mind could not take. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoyed all three Transformers movies, know they are capable of suspending belief in the rules of logic and reason for an entire movie, and want nothing more than to see big huge action scenes. If that's you, you'll like this movie, and more power to you. If not, I'd recommend saving your money.

Replay value; low."
1179,2.0,"I gave it two stars. One star because the action was fun and I did laugh through the movie. The second star was because the seat I was sitting in was comfortable.

Here Duke dies by hovering helicopters and oh by the way, with every other Joe except for a handful. Come on!!! Why did RZA play blind master? Why did Cobra Commander leave Destro in the chamber? At the end of part one he was saying Destro would serve him. When did Cobra Commander and Destro have time to talk and change things? Another issue I have with this movie and the first one is, why does each Joe have to wear the same uniform? It's freaking rediculous and basically took away from the chracters in the movie. I was in the Army and saw alot of special forces guys and though they may be wearing the same uniform, they looked different because some may wear hats, scarfs, glasses, or what have you. They tried to deliver a unique version of Joe and in my opinion they moved so far away from canon they should not make a sequal, wait five years and reboot this whole thing. And please, do not hire a director that has only made dance movies. Common sense would have lifted this movie up."
1180,3.0,"Way too much screaming for no reason ( which is just annoying) & the ""footage"" from the participants was horrible.  Half the time you can't see whatever they are freaking out about.  But it was somewhat creepy...Better than some other ""reality"" type horror movies that I've seen."
1181,5.0,"The guy who lasted until the end reminded me of someone who I know from youtube. I checked the credits, though, it wasn't him. The voice sounded just like him, though. Creepy, to say the least; and that's not even scratching the surface. Sure they weren't world-class actors/actresses, but it was supposed to be a reality TV type thing, so of course they're going to be normal people freaking out at paranormal things! I'm very glad that there were no nude or adult scenes in this film. It's worth a watch ...I just wish I hadn't watched it alone."
1182,5.0,"When I heard that the WWE was going to release this set I was so happy.  At one time the King of the Ring was one of my favorite events and this set should be really good.  One of the things, first off, that I noticed is that a lot of these matches have not been released before or maybe have been released once which is a good thing.  I love the fact that we will get to see the finals of the very first KOTR with Bret Hart vs Bam Bam Bieglow.  Honestly, this is a pretty good match and the fact that Bret wins makes it so much better.  The other match you get from 1993 is the Hogan vs Yokozuna match for the World title.  I kinda wish they would not have shown this one.  It's an ok match but the ending is just awful.  If you've never seen this match just wait and see what I'm talking about.  From 1994, we get the finals again when Owen Hart beats Razor Ramon to win the KOTR.  This is a great match and a good representative from th 94 event.  I only wish they would have included the World title match between Bret and IC champ Diesel.  These 2 always had great matches and this is one of my favorites between the two.  The 95 edition of the KOTR was probably the worst one of all the events as Mabel wins the thing!  The match they chose to represent the event was the Kiss My Foot match between Bret Hart and Jerry Lawler.  This feud was a good feud but you know i really never thought these two worked that well in the ring and this is just another example of that as this match isn't that good.  I kind of wanted to see Shawn Michaels vs Kama that went to a 15 min time limit draw in the first round of the KOTR tournament.  The 1996 edition features a few matches from it.  The first one is the IC title match between Goldust and Ahmed Johnson.  This was a good match with a lot of really good mind games being played by Goldust.  It is a little suprising that they chose this one but it is good.  Of course, we get the finals with Jake Roberts and Steve Austin.  The match itself sucks but hopefully they'll keep the interview with Steve afterwards as this is what truly made him in the WWE.  We also get the world title match between Shawn Michaels and the British Bulldog.  This is a killer match and well worth the price of the DVD set alone.  These two guys always put on a great show and this one is just as good as the rest.  On the Blu Ray edition u also get Steve Austin's first match of the night against Marc Mero which is actually a good match.  We get 2 representatives from the 1997 edition.  The first is the match with Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels.  This is a pretty good match even though both Shawn and Steve have slammed the match in the past.  I actually like this match and as a note check out the kid who tries to jump into the ring to save Shawn near the beginning of the match.  The other match you get is the KOTR finals between Triple H and Mankind.  I thought this was also a good match to add to the set.  From the 1998 edition we also get 2 entries.  The first is the finals between Ken Shamrock and the Rock.  Honestly, these 2 guys never really had a good match but this one was very very good.  I remember watching this one when I was a teenager and being on the edge of my seat.  This is a good one.  The other one is one that we have seen so many times I think the WWE could have done without it and that is the Hell in the Cell match with Undertaker and Mankind.  Is it a great match ?  Yes it is.  Is it worth another spot on a DVD ?  No I don't think it is.  I mean it's been on a Taker set, Mick Foley's set, the Hell in a Cell set and just recently on the OMG set.  I'm not a hater of the match I just think it's been released too much and is now overkill.  The 1999 edition has one match and that's the world title match between the Rock and the Undertaker.  It's an ok match but nothing really killer in it.  I actually would have liked to have seen the KOTR finals with X-Pac and Billy Gunn going on it.  That was a really good match that I would have liked to have seen on the show.  We get 2 entries from the 2000 event.  The first is the finals of the KOTR with Kurt Angle and Rikishi going at it.  This is a pretty good match but is it worth being on the DVD ?  Probably not.  The second is the World title/6 man tag match with champion Triple H teaming with Vince and Shane McMahon vs Undertaker, Kane and Rock.  The stipulations for this match was basically whoever scored the pinfall got the win and the title (Triple H did not have to be involved in the decison to lose the title).  This was a good match with a sick spot from Shane in it.  The 2001 edition has 3 entries.  The first is the Light Heavyweight title match between Jeff Hardy and X-Pac.  It's a good match but not great.  Not sure why this one is on here.  The next one is the finals of the KOTR with Kurt Angle and Edge.  I love this match as it has a lot of action in it and we got Kurt trying to go for his 2nd straight KOTR.  Great match.  The other one we get is the street fight between Kurt Angle and Shane McMahon.  This match is just freaking sick from start to finish.  This is actually one of the best street fights I have seen and thought it maybe should have won Match of the Year in 2001.  The 2002 edition was the last one to be on PPV and has 2 entries.  The first one is the KOTR finals with Brock Lesnar and RVD.  I like this match even though I knew who was going to win.  As a side note I am glad that WWE is starting to put Brock in some of their DVD sets as it seems like he was shunned there for a while.  The other match is a killer one with Kurt Angle vs Hulk Hogan.  This is actually one of Hogan's best matches in the WWE and that is due in no small part to Kurt and his ability to make just about anyone look good.  If you get the Blu Ray edition you also get the World title match with Triple H vs Undertaker.  Do not expect a WM 17 or a WM 27 from these two in this one.  I remember buying the PPV when this came out in 2002 and I actually fell asleep during the match.  It isn't that good.  After 2002, the KOTR went on a sabbatical and made its return in 2006 where it was mainly done on TV.  We do get one match from 2006 and that is the finals between Booker T and Bobby Lashly.  This match did take place at Judgement Day and it was a pretty good match.  I was happy that Booker won and added another honor to his unbelievable career.  Next we go to 2008 as there was no KOTR in 2007.  We get another match that is the finals from 2008.  The match is CM Punk vs William Regal and it is a really good contest.  I can remember watching this one and just hoping that Punk would win but that was not to be.  Still this is a good one.  The Blu Ray edition will include the semi final match between CM Punk and Chris Jericho which is also a very good match.  After 2008 we again skip a year and the KOTR makes a return in 2010.  We get one match from that one and it is also the finals with Sheamus taking on John Morrison in a thriller of a match.  I actually thought this was going to be Morrison's match but they went with the Celtic Warrior instead.  And again if u get the Blu Ray you also get Alberto del Rio vs Daniel Bryan in a quarter final match that was pretty good.

So, all in all I think the WWE has done an outstanding job with the match selection here.  Some of these matches I have never seen on a DVD release or have not seen in quite some time and look forward to seeing them again.  I really can't wait for this one to be released.  I say good job on this one WWE!!"
1183,5.0,"Watching ""Atlas Shrugged"" is nothing dissimilar at ALL to watching the 6 O'Clock news on any given evening.  We Christians see this as the Books of Daniel and Revelations coming true, and fully expect to hear that trumpet blow, literally any minute now.  And some (evidentally) ""ex-hippie"" sorts believe that the end cometh this December 21, either by the sun sort of ""breaking wind"" and incinerating the earth, or (this one is good!) ""naughty alien reptiles"" conquering the earth.  Myself, I tend to disagree on that point - I mean, who are YOU to make conjecture as to when God is gonna say, ""Blow the trumpet, Gabriel, I can't deal with them any longer.""  ""Atlas Shrugged"" is a rather secular conjecture about the ""end of time,"" infinitely more believable than the ""naughty alien"" thing.  In truth, though, I found ""Atlas Shrugged"" more akin to Fritz Lang's 1926 masterpiece, ""Metropolis,"" you know, that riff about those who ""have,"" and those who ""want it"" - except when Georgio Moroder got hold of ""Metropolis"" in, what, '84? he increased its value exponentially by adding sound, color, and that freaking BRILLIANT music! Still: the ""rich have it and the poor want it,"" blah-blah-blah, only, in the the case of ""Atlas Shrugged,"" people seem to be mysteriously disappearing from the face of the earth.  I haven't read the book - yet - nor had I even seen ""Atlas"" till last weekend, when a kind of...serious friend, down in Georgia, played ""Altas"" for me, after a rather lenghty dinner debate about eschatology (that means ""pertaining to the end of the world/judgement"" kind of thing), and after the movie, I reiterated (what would be a ""hook line"" if we were talking about pop muzak), ""Who IS John Galt?,"" the question raised in the movie as to ""why"" and ""by/for whom"" these disappearences are occurring.  I have shopping today, and tomorrow night, I'm going to rehearse with a new band: but you can just BET that Saturday, I'll see ""Atlas Shrugged II.""  Oh yeah...and one other thing: ANY movie that annoys liberals THAT badly just HAS to have merit, take that for what it's worth..."
1184,4.0,"One of my biggest complaints with The Wire, aside from being such a freaking bummer and not very satisfying to fans, was how terrible it looked on dvd. The show was produced on a very low budget and it showed on dvd. These blu rays look about 10 better. The big downside though is that they altered the aspect ratio from 4:3 to 1.78:1. Basically what that means is that it originally had black bars on the right and left sides of the screen but now the image fills the whole screen. The problem with that is that they had to blow up the image while cutting out like 10-20% of the peripheral image. So there are alot of  too-tight shots where you can't really see much more than people's torsos and head. Not a huge deal, especially considering this show never really had any great cinematography or anything to really miss. Most people won't ever notice that the image has been cropped. All in all, this is a much improved version over the dvds."
1185,5.0,"This is a great action packed anime series, Dante a wisecracking tall hot white haired half human half demon who is addicted to and loves strawberry sundeas and lives on pizza modern day devil hunter who ironically hunts and kills demons. His weapons are his two guns Ebony and Ivory are always kept loaded and ready, a really cool long gothic looking sword Rebellion he carries on his back, and his amazing martial arts fighting skills is given strange cases to work on

In the first ep he is assigned to take care of and escort a young girl Patty the heiress to a fortune to the reading of the will and along the way she is hunted by demons that Dante protects her from. One part I think that people will like in ep 1 is while Dante is driving her to the will reading he pulls the girls hat down over her eyes then with his gun kills the demon that is about to kill her while it is holding on to the side of a moving truck without stopping his car I personally found that to be freaking awesome

Some of Dante's cases include a rich man who's daughter is being romanced by a handsome guy with powers and her father thinking he's a danger to her wants Dante to kill the guy, that tale has a very interesting little twist to it I don't want to give it away and spoil it for anyone

An ancient jeweled mask that grants wishes with a twist

The beautiful human singer who mysteriously disappeared some time ago and when one of her songs is played appears as a deadly demoness

A motorcycle racer racing another guy trying to evenge his brothers death a situation that has a freaky unexpected surprise in it

Later on it leads up to patty again unknowningly patty and her mother are part of a lower level demons plot to gain great power he is gathering various artifacts to perform a ritual in order to obtain his goal

If you love lots of action mixed with humor, and interesting characters like Lady a human female devil hunter who works with Dante and the one who also busts his chops at times. And later on Trish a gorgeous female demon and Dante's ex partner who controls and uses lightening. Morrison his agent the interaction between he and Dante is hilarious, and others. And has some of the most awesome music there is then this is for you, you will not be bored with this series, it is a full of amazing special effects, plots, action, and great characters from start to finish, this is one of the best anime investments I have ever made, I only wish they had made more episodes for the series the second I saw the first episode I was hooked on it"
1186,4.0,"*The Revenant (no connection to the fantastic Neonfly song of the same name) has currently been making its rounds on the HBO Channels. Since it was a Vampire movie I had not previously heard of, my curiosity was up, so I gave it a watch. It is an extremely low-budget, totally cheesy Dark Comedy. I loved it!

Lt. Bart Gregory [David Anders - well-known from Heroes, Warehouse 13, 24, The Vampire Diaries, etc.] was killed in battle. However, after his funeral and burial, he inexplicably comes back from the dead. He seeks out his best friend, Joey (Chris Wylde).

One of their mutual friends, Mathilda (Jacy King), trying to make sense of this deduces that Bart is either a Vampire or a Zombie. It's hard to tell at first sight - he's not as suave as most Vampires, but not as deteriorated as a Zombie, despite the weird eyes. Turns out, he's a Vampire. She keeps telling Joey to ""do the right thing"" and decapitate Bart during daylight hours, which Joey can't bring himself to do.

Thinking he's been given a Second Chance at living, Bart decides to use his new-found powers and abilities for ""good"", and he and Joey soon find themselves on the evening news as the infamous ""Gunslinging Avengers"" taking out the Los Angeles area's worst criminals (while feeding Bart's need for blood).

One nuance Bart & Joey forget to factor in is - how to stop any Vampire's victims from coming back as an Undead themselves. Big mistake! Another big mistake is - Bart's girlfriend Janet (Louise Griffiths) finds out that he's back - after having taken solace in Joey's arms after the funeral.

Incredibly surprising and unexpected ending, which I'm NOT going to spoil. You'll have to see for yourself.

This is one of the freshest takes on the Vampire in decades. It's a freaking train wreck throughout that you just can't look away from. Plenty of unanticipated surprises laced through the entire movie. You have to see this one at least once!

1187,2.0,"""It ain't a damn joke man, the freaking thing's alive.""  A group of scientists in Antartica have discovered something.  When grad student Kate Lloyd (Winstead) is sent to see what they have found she and lead scientist Halvorson begin to butt heads.  While the fighting occurs something awakens the discovery.  I have never seen the original or the 80's remake so I wasn't sure what to expect from this.  What I found was that this was a very un-original and pretty boring movie.  I do watch a ton of movies every week and have noticed that there are about 4 ideas that keep getting re-done and this is part of the problem. The plot of this one is...group finds something...new group shows up...thing breaks out...people get killed and chased for a few hours.  The majority of the movie is people running around in the dark trying to hide.  I like the movie better when it was called ""Alien"".  Overall, unless you are a huge fan of horror movies I wouldn't be too excited. This is nothing that hasn't been seen before over and over. I give it a C+."
1188,5.0,"My review is based SOLELY on the acting skills of the movie. Dominic Cooper is freaking brilliant. I never doubted for one moment it wasn't two seperate individuals playing the role and that's because he's just that bad a$$ and good.

I'm not sure how much of the story line/events are true but based by some net research after watching this movie the real life body double did say the ""carving"" scene was real but a rose pruner was used and the ""wedding celebration"" scene was true involving the bride. I'm trying not to give too much away to anyone who hasn't seen it.

Based on news reports Uday's reputation as a sadistic, mentally challenged lunatic seems to be well founded and the premise of Iraqi citizens were definitely afraid of Uday coming into power. I'm trying to get my hands on Latif Yahia's book. Is it all true? Who knows apparently there is no one around to fact check the events in Yahia's book or is there?"
1189,5.0,"This episode does not suck, thank you very much. This episode was great and full of Lassie. I loved at the crime scene when Shawn and Gus tell everyone it was a vampire and they (mostly Gus) start freaking out. I had my headphones in but was laughing out loud! So funny!"
1190,4.0,"So the last good zombie apocalypse movie that I saw was Zombie Land and I was very excited when I saw this in the Red Box.  I mean seriously, just the title shows how awesome it's gonna be!

***SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS***

So the movie mainly follows a few main characters as they try to get toward a safe haven called ""Catalena"" or something, it's on an island and it's supposedly free of zombies.  They run across some other survivors whose names don't really stand out in my mind as I sit here and write this.  But the main one I cared about was Ving Rhames!  This guy is such an awesome guy that he doesn't need a gun, he just bashes zombies in the head with a sledge hammer!

They move toward the safe haven and they come across zombies that have been shot in the head with arrows and they wonder if these are other survivors just ahead of them.  Later they meet up with these archers and they team up together to travel to safety.

I loved this movie!  I only have two complaints about this movie.

First of all, Ving Rhames and one of the women survivors come across a .50 cal machine gun and the woman says, ""I wanna take it with us.""  Why?  Do you have any idea how heavy that thing is?  Not to mention how noisy it is?  When you shoot that thing off, all the zombies within 10 city blocks are going to hear it and descend upon you like a pack of ravenous dogs!  Plus how are you going to transport it?  Oh I see, you're just going to put it in a shopping cart and wheel it around.  Then when she fires the weapon while it's still in the cart, the cart itself doesn't move.  COME ON!!!  Gimme a freaking break!  Do you have any idea how much recoil there is on a .50 cal machine gun?  Why do you think they are always bolted to the roofs of vehicles and held down with sand bags in front of fox holes?  If she had fired that gun in that cart the kick-back would knock her over and the fact that the thing it was sitting on had WHEELS, wouldn't be too smart either.  You can use your head and figure out what would happen if anyone in the real world tried to do that.  Not to mention when she was shooting the machine gun, the ammo belt that was going into the gun, WASN'T FRIGGIN' MOVING!!!  Ugh!!!

My other complaint is the climax of the movie.  The survivors are ambushed at the docks where they are supposed to meet up with a boat that would take them to safety and what are they ambushed by?  Take a guess, seriously, think about if you were in a zombie apocalypse.  What would you expect to be ambushed by?  Zombies?  Other humans looking to rob you?  Maybe even a lich controlling the zombies?  No, of course not!  That would make too much sense, instead let's have them be ambushed by zombie tigers.  Seriously, ZOMBIE TIGERS are the final bad guy these survivors have to face off against.  That was just... oh my god, my head hurt from how stupid that was.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

So even with those two things that I didn't like, this was still a pretty good movie and I do recommend it for anyone who loves zombies.

Check it out!"
1191,4.0,"Just finished watching TLC 2011 so here's my thoughts.

Zack Ryder vs. Dolph Ziggler - US Title - Dolph Ziggler always has great matches, espescially when he opens a ppv. A ppv always seems to go very well whenever he opens, and this is no exception. Great wrestling matchup, and I dig Zack Ryder too. And it's great to see him finally win a singles title. 4/5

Air Boom vs. Primo/Epico - WWE Tag Team Title - It's good to see air boom (since it looks like its going to be short lived. But this match isn't really anything special 2/5

Beth Phoenix vs. Kelly Kelly - Divas Title - Another crappy divas match, they even messed up on a few spots during the match, these two actually have had good matches between each other, but this isn't one of them 1/5

Cody Rhodes vs. Booker T - WWE Intercontinental Title - It's great to see Booker T back in the ring against a talented wrestler like Cody Rhodes, definetly not the best match either of these guys have had but it's not bad either. 2/5

Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Stairway to Hell Match - (A ladder match with a weapon on a top is known by ECW as a Stairway to Hell Match, so I'm calling it that) This was actually a very violent match, granted we can't have blood in WWE but despite that this was a violent match and I can't say anything really bad about it. There was one spot where Nash got hit in the head with the hammer while they were on top of the ladder that looked kinda ridiculous but other than that, great match. 4/5

Sheamus vs. Jack Swagger - Random bonus match, always good to get a bonus but nothing special 2/5

Theodore Long dressed as santa and even gave the now talking Hornswoggle a Christmas gift, it's funny that he Hornswoggle never really talked and now that he does he is hilarious to listen to.

Mark Henry vs. Big Show - World Title Chairs Match - This isn't a wrestling classic like they've had over the last few ppvs, this is hardcore! Steel chairs galore! Chairs completely fill the ring and they just went at it, it's a little short but nonetheless enjoyable. And then Daniel Bryan goes in a cashes in his MITB briefcase. 2/5

Randy Orton vs. Wade Barrett - Tables Match - This match made it into WWE's top 25 of 2011, but I don't really know why. It's a good match, but idk why it'd be worth going into the top 25. 3/5

CM Punk vs. The Miz vs. Alberto Del Rio - WWE Title 3-Way TLC Match - Although WWE has made changes over the last few years this is one that has stayed the same. TLC, carnage, carnage, and freaking carnage! While there's no storyline for this match, and the only reason it's a TLC match is because of the PPV gimmick, but it was a great match that is insanity from start to finish. 5/5

All in all a good ppv, there's glitches here and there but it's having."
1192,3.0,"...unfortunately, the apparent low budget, so-so delivery by the cast (with the exception of Pollyanna McIntosh), frequent implausibilities, and loose ends, for me, THE WOMAN fell short.
*** WARNING: SPOILERS!***
The locations are cheesy. Cinematography is for spit. Neither do a thing for creating a mood, or atmosphere. Quite the contrary, the way this movie was filmed detracts from a movie that needs every apsect to lend to it's authenticity. I did NOT find Chris Cleek the least bit intimidating, chilling, or threatening. He seems awkward and miscast. He looks, and speaks as if he is on the verge of cracking up. I agree with the reviewer who compared him to Will Farrell. Its like any minute the movie would be interupted by G.E. Smith's freaking sax, and Cleek was going to turn to the camera and say, ""Live from New York, its Saturday night!!!"".
Okay, the incongruities, the ""woods"" where the father is hunting, and comes upon this feral woman looks like its 100 yards from the local mall. This feral woman who has survived in the ""wild"", where did she come across the clothing? A mini skirt if memory serves? Her hair is slightly unkempt, not matted down and covered in filth, as one might expect. In fact it looks like she gets frequent trims, the ends are cut straight across, nice and even. No excess body hair. Apparently, razors and depilatories are readily available. The teacher that just drops by her student's house; uninvited, unannounced, to tell the parents of what she feels is an emotionally troubled girl, that she she believes the girl is pregnant. Perhaps this woman looking for a career change? Why else would she behave so ludicrously? Surely she would be fired, and possibly have legal action taken against her. Guess, in the frenzy to express her concern, she overlooked that.  And I guess the notion that perhaps the reason for the change in the girl's demeanor is the result of dysfunction at home? Hey, anyone could have overlooked that, right? And what was with the other feral, pseudo dog girl?! I'm sorry, that was just so hokey, and corny. And finally, the way youngest daughter just scurries off with this strange woman. Come on.
Clever premise, unrealized."
1193,1.0,"Here again. I will not be reviewing this in my normal method. It is obviously not for anyone under the age of 18, some even 25.

The 1 Star Rating is so people can find my review better. Read through.
The reason I say, no one under the age of 18, is because we are supposed to protect them from needing to see this. Their time will come when they must do the same and hopefully they were raised by good parents.

It is common knowledge that this movie is almost perfect and should be mandatory for every single man and woman in government to watch. The 1 Star Rating was click bait. Look past the movie and get to the heart of the true story. Yes, this movie displays brilliant and honest depictions of language barrier and men who should have all faced the death penalty. And those who can't understand it, well, you chose a different venture in life, but you cannot deduct star for lack of experience. Who cares about the production of the movie? Did you miss the whole freaking movie? Is someone that insensitive to life and should be evaluated? I have spent two years in South Korea, 4 months in Haiti, and 7 months in Afghanistan. My service time was 5 years Army Military Police (been awarded an AFSM, a Combat Action Badge, Army Commendation Medal, and a Valorous Unit Award, to just name several), I have a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice: Criminal Psychology from Liberty University, I am a Wall Street Journal Young Professional, Life Coach Certified and Accredited, an Amazon Author, a member of the Christian Association for Psychological Studies, and a non-profit board member. With that, I promise everyone, American U.S. Departments could care less about women, just as this movie shows. They allow the military personnel to dabble in Prostitution in Korea, day after day. They know it happens, thousands of people know it (everyone who has served in Korea, knows). Any paid services for male mental satisfaction from women, is legally prostitution. Where else does it happen, with U.S. money and DOD, DOT, DOE, etc. identification? Why do you think certain places put their businesses outside of military bases IN the United States? Drugs, sex trafficking, and legal business are the three largest options. Turning the other way, is not ""enforcing law"", it should be charged with 20 years in prison. The CIA is 10 years, minimum, ahead of the normal populace, in technology and warfare. Are we dense? Human Trafficking can be ended in 1 or 2 years, globally (there are more U.S. forces than trafficked women around the world). But, men pay to torture women and other men are so emotionally and psychologically lethargic, they say, ""It was a good movie. Most women want to be there and are not tortured at least twice a week. The end. I guess I'll watch the Transformers now, for a laugh, before I lay down to my bed with no worries and I never think about what women are being forced to do, right this very moment, as I can freely choose my next move. How many tears must be cried, by these women, every two days? When was the last time I cried? It was a family tragedy, not an endless array of heartless men who are addiction to violence and bleeding flesh."" And never think of what it feels like to LIVE EVERYDAY BEING SEXUALLY TORTURED. 4 million women can tell you. Another 5 million dead women can, in the span of what, 70 years?

Oh, well. Caring comes with action, not the ignorant ""innocent until a hidden camera shows the event, because neuropsychologists are not really good at knowing brain behavior and should not be trusted to detect when a man says something stupid to cover himself, from justice""...

Welcome to the world, hopefully you all only birth boys. One less thing you have worry the rest of your life about. Liberty mattered more than safety, back in the days when men had reason to fear justice and their ethical neighbor. Now, no one is scared of law.

1194,2.0,"The look of the film is top-notch; breathtaking sets, gloomy atmosphere, beautiful cinematography - everything you'd expect with Guillermo del Toro co-producing. Too bad the movie's a mess, not very scary, and full of illogical character reactions or actions that will have you yelling ""What the HELL are you doing? Just turn on the freaking LIGHTS!"" more than once. The original TV-movie remains the best, so creepy it will have you looking over your shoulder after a viewing; this one, not even close."
1195,4.0,"Going into this movie, I for some reason thought that Del Toro had directed it, instead I saw in the opening credits that he had only produced the movie and co-wrote the script. So while you can clearly see Del Toro's influence on this film, it falls short of what it could have been. The intro of this film was scary, brutal, and freaking awesome, but it almost could have been from another movie (or maybe something shot to convince them to green light the film). After the intro the pace, violence, and scariness took an immense drop that never really picked up, even in the end. However, I loved the atmosphere and the creatures, along with their creepy actions. What I couldn't stand was the pure idiocy of all the people in the movie.

DBAotD embraces Hollywood Horror tropes to a fault, they include having a shy child for some reason searching through a new scary house alone for no reason without any fear (even gathering tools and opening a rusted shut and bolted ash pit because she hears scary voices wanting to play), parents discounting their child without publishable scientific evidence of the events, and a refusal to leave the house until it's too late. I appreciated the fact that the movie didn't use the current Hollywood Horror cliche of the startle scare which I find very overused and annoying. I also liked how the people could actually fight and kill the monsters (tooth fairies/gnomes). However, I think that the director of the film really missed out on making a great movie by not embracing this facet further. I would have loved if the light (instead of just making the creatures run & hide) actually hurt/burned them. Then when the child starting using the camera flashbulb to fight them, it would have been awesome if the flash exploded the little creatures. They could have completely changed the annoying ending, and the whole tone of the movie for the better. Instead, we had the stupid people doing more stupid things, and the most overused ending in Horror, the potential sequel cliffhanger. Still, I actually enjoyed the movie for all of its faults."
1196,3.0,"I couldn't tell if the young US Marine Nathan Harris suffers from PTSD or had developed an addiction to the cocktail of pills which was making him behave erratically. In the end, what I ultimately took away from this documentary is Nathan has a sore hip, he sometimes argues with his wife, he likes to play with handguns during the most inappropriate situations, plays video games, and he takes a lot of pills. So in a lot of ways he's a totally normal twenty-something American male.

The documentary jumps back and forth between his third and final combat deployment as a US Marine, the latter footage being about 85% talking/negotiating with Afghan men and 15% actual footage of his platoon in contact with pro-taliban fighters.

Back home, we'll see Nathan struggle with hip/leg pain and civilian re-integration as he laments about how a Wal-Mart without vacant parking spaces is more stressful to deal with than being in combat, or how ordering fast food through the drive-thru is an ordeal. Perhaps he's claustrophobic or just rocked out of his gourd on pain pills, but there's a lot of footage of him burying his face in his hands seemingly freaking the *&%^ out.

It seems like the filmmaker thought these scenes of him losing his cool about totally mundane activities might make it hard for the audience to relate with his mental state, so the decisions was made to include an excessive amount of footage of a visibly semi-sedated Nathan handling loaded handguns around his visibly nervous wife. In bed. Or just while hanging out on the couch. You know, perfect moments to whip out a handgun and play with it. Doesn't the USMC teach you something about how one gun is for fighting and one is for fun?Watching these moments made me feel as uncomfortable as his wife.

The problem with the footage of him being back home with his wife is the viewer has no concept of the passage of time. The viewer won't know how long he's been back or how long it's been since he'd been shot. The whole time I was wondering if his wound was really that crippling in the long term, or if he was in all that constant pain because he'd just been shot 2 weeks ago and he's still recovering from complicated surgery. I got no sense of the severity of the wound over time other than he might walk with a limp for a while, and certainly his days as a grunt are over. Will he walk with a cane his whole life? Or will he be back to normal in a couple years with physical therapy? The film would have you believe the former but I'm dubious.

When you finally start to establish a timeline you are jarringly taken back to deployment footage, which feels like it is going to culminate in showing you, from his first person camera or the camera of another, the moment he takes that devastating bullet to the hip, but it never does. You just see some blurry footage of somebody on a litter being loaded into a medevac helo, who may or may not be Nathan. It's frustrating.

Still, I found in Hell and Back Again interesting simply because Nathan seems like genuinely good guy with a good sense of humor and a heart of gold, so I was sympathetic toward him almost immediately. I didn't find the ""flashbacks"" to Afghanistan boring like other reviewers did. Deployments aren't 100% firefights, there's a lot of relationship building with the locals, and the footage shows just that."
1197,5.0,"Just like everyone else, I was ecstatic to see these shows finally get a DVD release. But just like everyone else, I had some questions I wanted answered before purchasing. Rather than freaking out and spamming the comments with ""WHERE'S SEASON 1?!?!?!?"", I decided to go straight to the source and ask the team over at RuPaul's Drag Race directly, via Facebook. These were my questions, and these were their answers:

Me: ""Is Season 1 coming to DVD as well? And are the ""Untucked!"" episodes included with the Season 2 & 3 DVD's?""

LOGO: ""Hi doll, lucite heels are clear, but some of our music for season one couldn't be cleared. Untucked isn't on the DVDs but lots of extras.""

So understand ladies and ladyboys, they did try to put Season 1 on DVD, but licensing the music (probably Destiny's Child) was probably a bit too expensive. But don't be sad, Amazon sells all of Season 1 digitally, so at least you can own it in some form."

So far  i own all the Dr. House seasons, Gilmore girls seasons, i won up to the 11th season of NCIS, i just watched all 12 seasons of murder she wrote and now Colombo. i love them all. and like i said no freaking commercials to put up  with..i own 504 dvd movies + because some of the dvd have more then one movie in the case. i have nearly 2 bookcases filled of episode seasons, and dvd movies. Yeah a lot of money invested in them but it beats the hell out of watching  the crap on tv. my daughter is a real bargain hunter for me to get the movies at a cheaper price. yes i do buy cheapy movies at Walmarts to for 4 or 5 dollars.

1200,2.0,"I had not seen this movie in the theater as I had planned, and now I wish I had of. I bought this on Blu Ray the day it came out, and I watched as soon as I got home. I was pretty darn excited. But with my hopes thinking that this would be like Piranha 3D in tone, I was not impressed. I wanted this movie to be good, and graphic and exciting, like it's smaller counterpart, but no, the Piranha's had more bite than this. Yes, there was the moment when that one (forgettable) character went into the lake with a spear to kill the Hammerhead, and that moment really creeped me out because I hate sharks, and that darned Hammerhead looked pretty freaking real. I should know not to go into a movie with high hopes if I have not done any research, but from what I had heard, it was a good movie. To a point I liked it, and to a point I loathed it. It was fun at times, then not so much other times, so hope came and went for this little ""shark"" film, if you can even call it that. If sharks scare the hell out of you, I say check it out, but don't go in thinking this is the next Jaws type of success movie."

1203,1.0,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!

I really enjoyed the first film, but I did not have high hopes for the second-- after all, what gave the original all of it's charm (meeting the girls, seeing the relationship between them and Gru blossom) had been wrapped up in a little bow...what else needed to be said?

Five minutes into the second film, I realized that the writers agreed with me.  They had nothing to say.  So this is about 90 minutes of minions, minions and more minions- oh, and two lame romances I can't imagine either the kids watching the movie or the parents who accompanied them could give a damn about.

I knew I was in for a LONG 90 minutes when I realized that the fart gun- a harmless, three-second gag in the first film, was going to be shown as a freaking institution in the second.  ""20-fart salute?""  Um, the gun was made by ACCIDENT in the first film.  Dr. Nefario said ""ok, I wondered why anyone would have any use for this...""  There are TWENTY in the second film?  And it's used TWICE? Wasn't funny ONCE!

Then the romance storylines.  Groan.  Nobody cares if Gru finds a wife (including Gru.)  NOBODY cares if the oldest girl finds a boyfriend.  I'm grateful that the opportunity for product placement when we find she's texting someone was passed by at least.  The girl Gru falls for is annoying as hell, and a really good reason not to see Despicable Me 3, if the rest of this mess wasn't enough already.

Finally, I was really annoyed at the dropped plot point concerning the villain's kid.  The villain has a young son- yet he's willing to commit murder and transform thousands of minions- and HIMSELF- into a rampaging, homicidal beast...umm, if he does this, who is going to take care of the kid?  We kind of needed to see some resolution here- if the villain is now captured and facing prison, what becomes of his son?

Anyway, this film was a chore to sit through, so unlike the first film, which was a pleasure I've gone back to several times.  What a shame."

1210,3.0,"Unfortunately this sequel to the excellent ""Taken"" (2008) provides little new and is certainly inferior to the original.  In this Olivier Megaton directed money grab, Liam Neeson remains effective as a former government secret agent.  In the original, he goes after Albanian goons involved in the sex trade.  They made the mistake of kidnapping Bryan Mill's (Neeson) teen age daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) which put Bryan in full on battle mode where he is able to use ""his special skills.""  This time, Kim's is still a teenager trying to pass her driver's license exam after a couple failures.

As an aside, I'm a big fan of the TV show ""Californication"" and 29 year old Maggie Grace has her own ""special skills"" in her role as a rock `n roll groupie in the recent season.  For her next role maybe she can play a high school student on ""Glee.""  Anyway, even if Kim can't parallel park, she can sure drive the hell out of a Mercedes cab, complete with a manual transmission.  Hard to focus on the plot, or lack thereof.

Bryan is on assignment in Turkey and the Albanian head of the family, Murad Krasniqi (reliable Rade Serbedzija), is out for revenge.  He and his henchman travel to Istanbul and get a bonus in that Kim and Bryan's ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) meet him there.  This time Lenore and Bryan are kidnapped and Kim must play a key role in getting them rescued.  There's nothing overly offensive except the script, especially some of the dialog.  Like ""Kim, drive faster"" or ""Kim, go go go"" and of course Kim freaking out.  There was no need to make this more-of-the-same movie except for box office receipts of course."
1211,1.0,"Thanks to the first film of the TAKEN series, under the auspices of 20th Century Fox, Liam Neeson as butt-kicking ex-spy Bryan Mills has successfully rebranded himself as one of the elder statesman of action cinema, now able almost to be spoken in the same sentence as names like Willis or Stallone. Then after that came a series that should have pushed the point home that he didn't belong there, with films like THE A-TEAM and UNKNOWN, which were both terrifically bad films. Unfortunately, he reteamed with A-TEAM director Joe Carnahan for THE GREY, an existential survival thriller that was well-received amongst fans and not unliked by critics. So, the Neeson Express was still rolling, and Fox, never knowing when to let a good idea lie (see the ALIEN, PREDATOR or DIE HARD series for evidence of this), decided to try to create a franchise out of what could only really succeed as a one-off. This led us to TAKEN 2, and what is one of the most boring, most unentertaining and really, one of the stupidest films of the year.

Basically, the film revolves around Mills' recently-divorced ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen, reprising her role) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, also reprising her ageless role) surprising him in Istanbul very shortly after he's concluded his protection service there. At the same time, the father (the wasted character actor Rade Serbedzija) of the ""Good Luck"" Albanian who Mills let fry in the chair from the first film, has sworn vengeance on Mills and his family. But instead of the daughter being taken, it's him and his wife. And Kim is the only one that can assist her father. And through a series of increasingly implausible scenarios, Mills takes the bad guys on to save his ex-wife.

I know that some people felt that there could never be a sequel to a film like DIE HARD because of how singular that film felt. Four sequels later, they're still expanding the idea to a fault. Well, TAKEN, because of its specific plot (kidnapped daughter), can really only work once, and as evidenced by this film, it's true. Bryan Mills, while being a badass, is little else. His motivations to save the wife of his ex-wife, who seems very keen on rekindling their relationship after her latest marriage ends, seem much weaker than a father protecting his daughter, and his pursuit of their assailants seem much more languid and rote. This is obviously a film that is going to hold no surprises, and to be honest, that should be enough. But the direction by French-director-with-the-greatest-action-film-director-name-ever, Olivier Megaton (TRANSPORTER 3, COLOMBIANA) is, similarly to his previous work, pretty uninspired and has no real excitement or vitality to it. Even the ""final fight sequence"" is dull and unimpressive. Neeson is just going through the motions here. I appreciate that actors are working people, and that they need to get some change in their pockets, but Neeson must have turned down better films than this. Janssen just exists to look nearly unconscious through most of the film, and Grace, who I really loved on LOST, and thought she was a lot of fun in the film LOCKOUT, has an expanded role here, but still makes not much of an impression. Plus, how old is she supposed to be? In LOST, she seemed to be in her early to mid-twenties, but in these films, she seems to be in her teens, and it really doesn't work.

I'm going to perhaps spoil something here, so you might want to not continue reading if you don't want to know more about the most idiotic point of the film. The film opens with Bryan looks to give his daughter driving lessons since she keeps flunking the parallel parking part. Of course, this means that a certain part of the film will require her to drive. When we get to this film's been-done-a-thousand-times-before car chase, she is inexplicably behind the wheel and instead of there being any beats where she is driving the car poorly, or is freaking out because she can't get the car in gear, she is driving this car like Jason Bourne on a bottle of No-Doz. She is doing things with a six-speed manual transmission that master stunt drivers would be envious of. And the finale of this chase scene culminates with Bryan instructing his daughter to drive DIRECTLY THROUGH the gates of the American Embassy without stopping, assuring that 50-caliber machine guns and other weapons begin firing at the car. And you know what? That's not even the stupidest part of the scene. It's when Bryan makes a call to one of his stateside spy buddies that puts an ignominous cap on this frighteningly moronic scene.

If I didn't think that TAKEN 2 was a bad idea before I saw it, I can guarantee to you now that it's a way of wasting valuable time that you will never get back. Skip it."
1212,1.0,"This is a fair movie... if you can manage to sit through the first half.  The first hour of this film made me want to scratch my eyes out, it makes no sense, has no consistency, is historically inaccurate to the point of bringing tears my eyes and is just abolutely retardedly ridiculous.  Poorly made is an understatement, this film will stand for all time as a testament to the fact that a big budget, big stars and outrageous CG effects do not mean the movie is good.

Other than the fact that the first half of the movie (unlike the book) made absolutely no sense, seemed to completely lack any purpose and was nearly sickening in it's constant camera-angle changing motion spinning toward making as much noise and pretty colors as possible without advancing any kind of plot... it was freaking BORING and completely uninteresting.  The only reason I even made it through more than 30 minutes of this tripe is because my wife refuses to not watch a movie she's paid for, no matter how awful.

Now, at about half-way through the film, after this absolutely ridiculous excuse for a ""party"" at Gatsby's (see below), the film slowly becomes tolerable.  As if they suddenly changed directors the film starts to turn away form flashy, noisy ""look at how cool looking my new movie is"" (which it isn't) toward an actual character and circumstance driven story.  Too late though, because by the time it really gets interesting it's pretty much over, and to be honest I was more than ready for it to be.

Why it sucks more than anything else:  Historical piece, base upon classic literature, with absolutely NO historical accuracy or base of reference.  Dear director and producer, this is supposed to be the roaring twenties you idiots, do some research.  JAZZ MUSIC DOES NOT SOUND AT ALL LIKE CLUB MUSIC, people didn't dress like that, the world didn't look like that, they didn't have super-charged cars that could outrun the batmobile, they didn't talk like that, and nothing was made of plastic.  Ever heard of this thing called art nouveau?  No?  Well they did in the twenties.  Truly, the opportunity this movie had to protray life in the twenties should have been inspirational.  Instead, the production team used it as an opportunity to go retarded.  SHAME ON THIS MOVIE AND EVERYONE INVOLVED IN MAKING IT.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to a drunken monkey, do not waste the money or time required to watch this."

However once i saw the first episode i changed my mind alltogether. It appears that they finally woke up and decided to give us a good Transformers show the like i have never seen ever since Beast Wars Season 3! The show is darker than the previous incarnations but it keeps a balance with the light heated approch of B.Wars and Animated. There is also a quite delicious treat...Peter Cullen and Frank Weller are back as Optimus Prime and Megatron! Peter keeps giving a sense of wisdom to Optimus that i really have missed and Frank, oh boy, Frank performs a Megatron that you shouldn't take lightly. If you thought the original Megatron as scary, wait to see this one!
 and i was really impressed with the animation. Normally, i dislike CGI but this one is something special. And the storylines are freaking awesome!!! I will give you a small spoiler for the first season closing episode, they face Unicron but you will be blown away with what they came up for this version of the world eater. Trust me, it is a major twist. There;s also a great depth exploration to the robots back story, especially for Optimus;s past which takes some elements from the original G1 show.

1220,4.0,"The Adventures of Tintin was a film I wasn't sure what to think of. Another motion capture CG animated film? Haven't we gotten enough of those from Robert Zemeckis? Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull really soured my opinion of an already faulty foundation known as Steven Spielberg's more recently directed films. However there was an upside: both the outstanding Edgar Wright and writer/director of Attack the Block Joe Cornish contributed to the writing of the film. The cast was also incredible and the film had a reputation amongst critics who had already seen it as being this nonstop action adventure. Tintin sounded like money going into it; BIG money. The final product turns out to be rather good, but isn't quite as spectacular as the hype lets on.

You're pretty much thrown into this mystery right from the start. This isn't an origin story. It's a continuation of a character most people either are already familiar with and/or immensely love. Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) buys a model ship at an outdoor market known as The Unicorn, but things become strange very quickly. Two men try to obtain the ship from him right after he purchases it: the first one warning him to get rid of it as soon as he can and the other, a man named Ivanovich Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) offering him any price he'd like. Politely declining, Tintin takes the ship home and eventually discovers that something is hidden inside the ship. As a journalist always hungry for a story, Tintin embarks on an incredible adventure accompanied by his dog Snowy and a sea captain named Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis).

The opening credits are amazing. It's traditional 2D animation, so it stands out from the rest of the film. There's this mini mystery solved during the duration of the opening credits. The pace is perfect and it's easily one of the best film openings of the year. You'll probably also notice the incredible score by John Williams right out the gate. It captures the atmosphere of crime and noir films perfectly and makes full use of a wide range of orchestral instruments. It's just an extraordinary score all around.

Peter Jackson once described the film's look as ""photorealistic; the fibers of their clothing, the pores of their skin and each individual hair. They look exactly like real people - but real Herge people!"" This is a really exceptional quote to fall back on when trying to describe how the film looks. Textures, hair, and the way character's mouths move are all very realistic. Despite sharing motion capture qualities with recent Robert Zemeckis films such as A Christmas Carol, Beowulf, and The Polar Express, Tintin looks better. It could be due to the characters looking more like the actual characters and not the actors who portray them, but Tintin pays ridiculous attention to detail which is probably just as much a blessing as it is a curse.

There are two action scenes in the film that are worth the price of admission alone; Captain Haddock's pirate flashback and the motorcycle chase scene. The pirate ship battle makes it seem like the Pirates of the Caribbean films failed miserably at anything remotely resembling action. Tintin has this fantastic use of perspective in that it's dynamic, but it doesn't get too experimental or crazy. It's like you're always in the right place at the right time. You can clearly make out what's going on at all times, which is something Michael Bay isn't able to claim the majority of the time. The motorcycle chase is my favorite of the two since it's nonstop. The pirate scene cuts back and forth between what Haddock is remembering and what's transpiring in the real world. The motorcycle chase is just in your face the entire time, lasts around six minutes, and puts you on the edge of your seat.

Tintin does have its shortcomings though. It does feature two of the year's best action scenes, but it also drags quite a bit in the middle. You get a little bored at times watching Tintin and Haddock be stranded out at sea, stumble through the desert, and Haddock's incessant rambling of never having enough booze. It results in the film feeling longer than it is. There was also a big deal about seeing this on screen. ""It MUST be seen in 3D,"" is what we were told. As you can imagine, the 3D isn't really mandatory for enjoying the film. Aside from one scene, I don't recall a huge use of it anyway. A lot of the action was also extremely unrealistic, as well. I know, it's Hollywood, it's Steven Spielberg, you're supposed to already have this suspension of disbelief anyway. If I get to the point where I notice that this couldn't happen in reality though, then I feel like the movie hasn't effectively done its job; not completely anyway. That feeling was almost overbearing at times with Tintin.

The Adventures of Tintin does seem to fall a bit short of the painting critics have painted for it, but is still well worth the price of admission. This year has also been an amazing year for movies featuring dogs: The Artist had Jack, Beginners had Arthur, and Tintin has Snowy. Snowy is easily the most entertaining of the three, but he's also the most animated and the most fictional. Tintin may be a bit slow at times, but visually it's freaking spectacular and the score is an easy contender for one of the best of the year. As far as animated films go, it's films like The Adventures of Tintin that movie lovers live for."
1221,5.0,"In one wide shot of the creature returning to the lab, he's wearing tennis shoes. Woops!
But it doesn't stop there my friends. Nooooooo.
In the morgue scene the corpse breathes. Boom mics appear in various scenes. Apparently the production had a film editor, but nobody knows why. Pointless and downright silly narrative monologue at the beginning with bad folk music in the background. Crew shadows everywhere. Monster standing around waiting for cue. Hanna Barbara cartoon like sound effects. A monster that wears a Phillis Diller feather boa. NOBODY in the film can act. Miles of ""stock footage"" that sticks out like a goiter on a prom queen. One of the best scenes in the movie is when the monster is in the lab freaking out and tearing the place apart. He ""acts"" like a 3 year old birthday boy after somebody flicks a booger on his cake.

This movie has been described as;
* Deplorable
* Horrible
* Crap

And, it's HILARIOUS! An all time classic!

If you're a fan of bad (and I mean really bad) movies, you're going to love this! The HD 1080p transfer isn't like James Cameron going back with his touch as he did to Titanic. This transfer shows a little wear...and it actually enhances the retro experience. There's a restoration featurette on the Blu-ray that shows the sharpening, color correction and digital noise reduction they used and it's pretty impressive. This Blu-Ray version is guaranteed to be the best treatment you'll ever see given to this film and it looks pretty darn good, even on a projector screen.

Denis, please stop, go and keep on playing with CAB, Stern, Niacin, or whomever you can find, but this is not a place in which you can shine anymore!!! Leave that new wife take the skins in Santana new band...That BTW in my humble opinion is nothing to write home about...Sorry Cindy, keep on drinking natural home made juices, and you will be a real good chef, but a good drummer is another story...sorry!!!!"
1223,5.0,Not much for words so I'll make it simple the movie was freaking great plenty of action a few twists and a whole lot of bang for your buck.
1224,3.0,"2012 was really quite a thrilling year for moviegoers, one of the most interesting in a long time. The Hobbit, Amazing Spider-Man, Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers, and ... Skyfall, marking the 50th anniversary of James Bond, a historic marking in film history.
Despite being that old, the character never lost any of its appeal - remarkable when you consider that the series was in production almost continuously for five decades. Many tried to explain the magic of 007, but in the end, my point of view is this: movie magic is like love. If you can explain love, it's not love.

Skyfall, like the two previous Craig outings, firmly positions Bond in the year 2012. But this time, it harkens back to his past, his childhood. So, while the plot itself doesn't use prominent source material, the film extensively explores the character's past as written by Ian Fleming.
You could rightfully say that the plot plays almost second fiddle to Bond's personal characterisation, the confrontation with his age and his relationship to M. This gives Daniel Craig a vast playing field to portray James Bond like he never was before, a fully fledged dramatic character. Indeed, what you will most likely take with you from this film is the acting and character scenes by Craig, Dench, Bardem and Fiennes.
However, this is where the good news probably end.

With all the hype, and reviews calling this the best Bond film since Goldfinger, I rarely left a theater so dissapointed.
You know, ever since Casino Royale, and even in the Brosnan era, we were confronted with always the same tagline: Break out from the formula!

With every new Bond movie, it appears like the producers say there will be something special. However, if you announce something special 10 times in a row, it's not that special anymore. And that is a trap the guardians of the Bond heritage should not fall into: replacing one formula with another.
When was the last time James Bond was sent on a regular, straightforward mission until the end? Well? That was precisely 17 years ago: GoldenEye.
That was the only movie that did not feature ""specialties"" such as ""Stockholm Syndrome"", Bond ""going rogue"" or Bond falling in love ""for real"" or Bond being constantly at odds with M.
The quintessential mistake the Bond producers made (and make) is their thinking that the formula didn't work anymore because of the lukewarm reception of the later Brosnans. It wasn't the formula that was wrong with these films - they were just averagely produced action films with average scripts.

That mistake was mended when Craig took over, and still they feel like they can't just send Bond on a regular mission without detours or psychological WMD.
The motto of these films may be ""away from the formula"" and ""more realistic"", and still there is that nagging feeling deep inside that says been there, done that. When Bond feels betrayed by M, when the villain hints at being Bond's darker side ...

But fine, these are deeper flaws, let's assume it's a given, and you are not bothered by it. Then Skyfall still has many flaws.
First and foremost, the plot. It was almost a miracle that the same guys who ""wrote"" Die Another Day also contributed to the Craig scripts. This time, however, Purvis and Wade let their Die Another Day mindset shine through.
Skyfall focuses on Bond being too old and failing his test, even though Quantum of Solace showed a Bond who just received his 00-status. Makes no sense. Even less sense makes the fact that even though focusing on a list of all undercover agents worldwide for more than an hour, leading even to M's retirement, it disappears in a magic cloud of smoke, never to be mentioned again.
Silva's scheme to kill M relies on so many coincidences that it even insults the term ""deus ex machina"".

He gets captured. Deliberately. Then he escapes, also planned (let's forget for a minute that his escape seems to rely on the assumption that MI6 would hire exactly the guy who invented Silva's choice software for encryption), and I ask myself why he wants to get captured in the first place; apparently, to see M. But since he seems to know out of nowhere where and when she will have a semi-public hearing (that coincidentally happens when he gets captured), why would he bother?
Indeed, I have come to accept many impossibilities in Bond movies - they simply belong in there.

But: we see Bond being shot twice, once hitting organs (as hinted at later), falling 500 meters to his demise, drowning on top of that. 10 minutes later, we see him banging a woman on some beach, conveniently focusing on the wound at his shoulder and forgetting the one that seems to have punctured his liver, and back in action. Gloss over much?
I have an easier time believing Jaws could have actually survived the freefall in Moonraker.
Then Berenice Marlohe's character. She's introduced in utterly brilliant scenes in Macau and Shanghai, making you believe she could be the best Bond girl since Natalya in GoldenEye. And then? Killed in the very next scene. What an awful waste.
Being a film music fan, Thomas Newman's score remains dull and generic, without the faintest memorable thematic wisper or hint at Bondian romanticism, strings chopping away every 30 seconds in an attempt (!) to generate thrill - the most forgettable Bond score since the original Dr. No score by Monty Norman.

Other things dragging the film down: an opening titles montage that feels like you are being sucked into an animated Tim Burton film, a finale on a graveyard that feels like a Tim Burton set, unintentional comedy when Bond plays ""Bond Home Alone"" at his family lodge, complete with exploding floorboards. And a dangerous reminder of better days when Bond drives M to safety in the old Aston Martin DB5, seemingly parked randomly in the city because we don't have enough hommages to freaking Goldfinger piled up, the last significant one was only in the very last movie!
Speaking of continuity, at the finale, a weeping Bond holds M in his arms and kisses her forehead. Really. An emotional Bond is one thing, a wimp another. This isn't the same man who threw Mathis' body into a garbage can in Quantum.
At some point I was praying that Bond's housekeeper wouldn't lead M to Bond's room and show baby pictures or a photo of his parents dancing in falling leaves.

Skyfall is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, but it surely isn't the revelation people are making it out to be.
We have now spent *three* entire movies to set up James Bond as we know him! For Christ's sake, enough with the Stockholm syndromes, the psychoanalysis of Bond's mind, the mother complexes and the broken hearts! After 10 years of this stuff, one is longing for a bloody Roger Moore escapist adventure.
It's time Bond walks right into the office to learn his mission again. That doesn't mean the movies can't be down to earth as they are now, and Bond sticking to Fleming's characterisation, but Bond being personally involved in everything for 15 years now is tiring beyond belief. Connery's films never needed that heavy stuff despite not resorting to pure comedy.
Despite contrary statements, the feel of the Connery films was never reproduced. Don't be fooled into believing it isn't possible.

Perhaps the Broccolis should actually watch Goldfinger to search for something else than the possibility to pay hommage to it."
1225,3.0,"Not a bad film, the star zombie makes ups were well done and, if you are NOT already getting burned out on the GLUT of zombie-virus 28 freaking days later, run me over and kill me now---- style zombie film, then this one won't leave you feeling a little too deja-vu.  Like I said, not bad, but the over-flux of this same style of fim and story line, means you gotta try harder for an edge and angle to re-excite this all too same story line.....if you can purchase it in the $10 range then worth it, otherwise please rent first and see if it entices you."
1226,2.0,"I'm not sure exactly what D'Onofrio was going going for here, but I'm guessing it was an excuse to sit hang out in the forest and smoke a little bit. The movie has a decent foundation to build an acceptable horror/slasher flick, but on all accounts they just pissed on it. The acting isn't terrible, the music is actually really freaking good, but it lacks any kind solid story, and you can find more believable violence on daytime public TV. Vincent liked some music and wanted to do something with it, calls were made, and somewhere along the way someone squatted and this movie fell out."
1227,5.0,"I really enjoyed this film & i'm a very picky vampire film fan being i come from the Hammer films era. I do not like cheesy vampire movies, and folks this is not one of them. Indemnity is a very well written and well paced film that holds a lot of suspense & the vampires are freaking cool, If you like films like near dark then watch this movie. I think it's suited for all aspects of the vampire genre."
1228,5.0,"The original FMA anime follows its own storyline while Brotherhood follows the story in the manga.  The two series have basically the same story until they get to Lab 5 and the two anime go in vastly different directions.  I'm not here to tell you which series is better.  I like them both equally because they are both excellent shows.  Brotherhood is much more fast-paced but it also skips a few things from the original series.  The first episode of Brotherhood has an anime-only story and an anime-only character and Mustang is introduced in a rather wonky way.  Mustang isn't introduced as this badass character but an useless one

I also like the origins of the Homunculi more in the original show.  Not that the origins of Father and his ilk are bad but there's really no explanation on where Father came from other than a throwaway line.  The motivation of Father is also kinda boring: become a god to ""fix"" the world.  It's just like any other anime plot.

Brotherhood is far from bad.  It has great characters, great action, great funny moments, great animation and a fantastic dub.  I feel like I should justify why I prefer dubs over subs.

The subtitles usually go by a tad too fast for me to read them. I usually focus more on the subtitles and nothing else.  Plus I can't tell who's talking if someone is off-screen unless they have a VERY distinctive voice; all I'm hearing is Japanese and NOT the character who's speaking.  I hear no accents, no emotion, no passion, all I'm hearing is a foreign language that I can't understand without watching what amounts to is a book--an actual book--shown on screen page by page.  I don't watch anime to read a freaking book.

Yes there are good dubs and this counts as one of them.

The original show is good and so is Brotherhood. I would recommend both shows actually.  They are equally good in my opinion."
1229,5.0,"Such a GREAT, MUST SEE Show...I didn't even know why they had delayed making another season after Spartacus: Blood and Sand had come out but, it turned out sadly, that production for another season was delayed because the great, and total hottie, lead actor Andy Whitfield was diagnosed with (and sadly passed away from) early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
My heart was truly sad when I heard about his passing and I honestly don't like Liam McIntyre quite as much as I did Andy Whitfield as Spartacus but, the show has a truly great ensemble cast that it doesn't really matter. Plus, Mr. McIntyre is still good, don't get me wrong, just not as good as Andy Whitfield was if you ask me.
Anyhow, this is a show that shouldn't be missed (except by those that it is inappropriate for) because it really is that good and worth getting STARZ for on your cable, sat, or dish just so you can watch it!  If I hadn't gotten STARZ to watch this particular show, I would have never been turned on to other shows they make now like Camelot, The White Queen, Da Vinci's Demons, and Black Sails now.  Bottomline, great freaking show!
JR in VA"
1230,5.0,This is another fantastic season. And I feel  Liam Mcintyre is doing a great job. I also have to agree  this episode 5 was over the top. I was jumping up and down in my chair and my dogs thought I lost it. When the stands in the arena started collapsing I was freaking out. Steven DeKnight is a fantastic writer. This season is AWESOME. I will most certainly buy the dvd.
1231,4.0,"Stars: Dominique Swain and Jake Busey

Screenplay : Paul Bales

Director : Joseph J Lawson

Love the work the four of you and rest of cast & crew accomplished thanks from this geekster.

Done almost 200 reviews on IMDB and 200 more on AMAZON,This flick is up there with my favorites.

There are Zombies of Nazi ilk and an adventure down to the center of the earth,Tough horror scenes rivaling SAW and villians like JAKE BUSEY (Yes,Gary's little boy,Move on) and Christopher K Johnson and dare I mention a villian bigger than any makes a comeback for The Asylum !

When you let your special effects in house direct,Magic happens, No Really .

So,This is a freaking awesome 90 minutes...Little Indiana Jones ,Shock Waves and Saw."
1232,5.0,"It's been a long time since I can remember an artist that continually just gets better with each passing album and concert. Joe Bonamassa is with out a doubt one of the best to come down the line in a long long time. I could go on and on but his praises have already been sung here. If you like this guy this will blow you away. Heck...every musician or any one with a lick of musical sense should pick this up. Yeah it's that good. I have several dozen concert Blu Rays ...(and 100 or more DVD's)...in my ever growing collection and this is now in the top 3. Porcupine Tree's Anesthetize, Rush's R30, Peter Gabriel's Growing Up, David Gilmour's Albert Hall and Toto's Falling in Between would be the other great ones so far. This is better than his Royal Albert Hall Blu Ray. (which is great too)

Here's the basics. Set list is great. Picture quality is great. DTS Master 5.1 is AWESOME on a good system. Band is tight. Venue is great. Guest artist great. None of the artsy fartsy distortion or quick 1 and 2 second cut and pans of Black Country's or other Blu Rays. Every one is showcased as needed for a proper amount of time. It's just a freaking awesome concert. Buy it!

This Blu Ray should be a new standard by which all others are judged."
1233,5.0,"I think everyone should see this movie. I mean everybody. I think that this movie not only for it's amazing quality and amazing actors, it is a scathing amd frightening depiction of what would happen during a nuclear war, and the afteath of survival. And it ain't pretty honey. Scared me so bad I had to research nuclear bombs, and statistics says it would take a hundred thousand years, just for nuclear half life, and no life would be able to survive the radiation of aftermath of fallout and beyond. Scary thought huh?! Ya, well it scared the living daylights right out of me. I was freaking out crying at one point with anxiety, but that's shows the incredible quality of the film makers. This movie is a roller coaster. I think that this is probably the scariest movie I've seen in a forever because it's so real, and so much of a possibility. After watching this I said 100,000 Hail Marys and I'm not even Catholic I just did it for good measure. I donated to UNICEF, and I rocked back and forth in a corner for about a month. Okay that's how scared you're going to be. And then the next day you're going to call up all your friends and your family and you're going to tell them all that you love them, even the distant relatives. Some of you will start trying to build your own bomb shelter, and start stacking food corner and hoarding it. I'm just saying these could be possible side effects of watching this movie and it's completely normal just go with it, you also might have a nervous twitch in one eye that's temporary... don't be worried. So for anybody who really likes the reality horror genre, put on a diaper, and then watch this because it's going to scare the poopsies right out of you."
1234,4.0,"I was really stoked when I heard the WWE were releasing a collection of the Clash and I was pretty happy with the outcome.  I do wish there was a documentary to go along with the matches but I'm still happy with what the WWE put out.

The first match is the main event of the first Clash between Ric Flair and Sting for the NWA World title.  The match is a classic and goes to a 45 minute draw.  It is also the match that many people, myself included, made Sting the superstar that he is today.  The match is very well contested and made all of the matches from Wrestlemania IV (held on the same night) pale in comparison.

Up next is another match from the same event as Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard defend the NWA Tag titles against the team of Barry Windham and Lex Luger.  This match is just plain good.  The fans for some reason are just rabid during this match and I think that's one of the reasons it's so good.  It's kind of short, clocking in at like 10:00, but still worth watching.

Up next is another tag title match from Clash II involving Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard defending the tag titles again against Dusty Rhodes and Sting.  This was another good match and again clocking in at around 10:00 but again worth seeing.  To me anything with Sting in it is worth watching.

The next match is pretty suprising as they chose to put on Ricky Morton vs Ivan Koloff in their Russian Chain match from Clash III.  I don't know I just found it to be a suprising pick but it was a good pick.  Of course there is some blood but these two do use the chain rather well and have a pretty good match.  Still, if I was choosing a match from this Clash I would have picked Sting against Windham.

The next match is a classic between Ric Flair and Terry Funk from Clash IX in an ""I Quit"" match.  Many have said this may have been the first real main stream hardcore match and after viewing it I kind of agree with it.  These guys leave it all hanging out and then some in this classic.  I like the use of the microphone although sometimes you can't hear what Flair says.  I like the use of the tables in the match and Flair's chops are just freaking killer.  Just put on your surround sound and listen to the sweet sound of Terry Funk's chest being turned to hamburger meat.  All in all good match and great choice for the set.

This next match blows my mind as to why it's on here:  It's the Clash X match with Mil Mascaras taking on Cactus Jack Manson.  This match sucks and the only reason I can think of as to why it's on here is because of the WWE trying to reach a bigger Latin audience.  That's great and all but jeez pick a better one then this.  Even Mick Foley said Mascaras was one of the most unprofessional wrestlers he has ever worked with.

The last match on the first disc features the Midnight Express taking on the Rock n Roll Express for the NWA Tag title at Clash XI.  This is an awesome match with 4 of the best tag wrestlers ever!  This match is fast paced and features some great back and forth wrestling.  The only downside is the DQ decision at the end but still worth checking out.

The first match of disc 2 is a US title match with Lex Luger taking on Ric Flair.  I love all of their matches and this one is no different.  Great wrestling, great psychology and all around great action make this match another one worth viewing.  It's another DQ match but it's still worth viewing.

Up next is a 6 man tag from Clash 15 with the Young Pistols and Tom Zenk taking on the Freebirds and Badstreet.  This match is ok and has some cool spots but I'm still wondering why it's on this set.

The next match is the Battle Royal from Clash XVI which is actually the first Clash that I saw as a kid.  Again this is another one of those matches where you're left scratching your head.  It's a good match and El Gigante (aka Giant Gonzales) wins but I still can't understand why it's on here.

The next one is Sting defending the US title against Rick Rude from Clash XVII.  This match is ok but I would have prefered the 20 minute draw they had at Clash XXI.  This one is subpar mainly because Sting was supposed to be hurt during the match.  Earlier in the show a package or gift was presented to Sting and Madusa was in it.  While she was flirting with him Lex Luger came out and attacked Sting.  So he was still showing signs of being hurt for this match and it kind of took away from it.  Still, it's a Sting match and worth viewing.

The next match is the 2/3 fall match for the WCW Tag titles between Brian Pillman and Steve Austin vs Ric Flair and Arn Anderson.  This was a great match even though the ending is pretty crappy.  I enjoyed all the time we see Austin and Flair in the ring with each other but one thing I didn't like is the fact that they edited out Jesse Ventura's commentary.  We only hear Tony Schvonie's commentary and it is kind of hard to watch because of that.  I don't know why they just didn't get Austin or Anderson or both to step in and do some guest commentary with JR or Michael Cole or Matt Striker.  That would have been better then gaps in the commentary.  Still, the match is fun to watch.

Up next is a match between Brian Pillman and Steve Austin.  This is after Austin turned on Pillman and joined the Studd Stable.  It's a good match but I honestly don't think it was good enough to be on this set.

After that one we get another suprising match with Dustin Rhodes and Steven Regal going at it for the WCW TV title.  This was a great contest between two very underrated wrestlers.  The match does go to a draw but it is very well worth seeing.

The last match of disc 2 is an Elimination match with Sting and Ric Flair taking on Rick Rude and Vader.  This match is very very good and I was so glad that I found out that it was going to be on the set.  It is really a dream match with 4 of the biggest stars at the time going at it.  The match goes for like 22:00 and that was pretty long for a televised match at the time.  Flair gets eliminated early on like after maybe 10:00 or so because of a massive suplex Vader gives him.  Then Vader is eliminated at the same time by DQ so the rest of the match is between Sting and Rude and these two deliver another great match up.  This one is worth the price of the DVD set alone!

The last disc starts with the Unification match of the WCW World and International titles when Sting once again takes on Ric Flair.  This isnt't Clash I again but it is still an enjoyable match.  I do feel that the whole Sherri storyline that goes along with the match takes away from it but it's still worth seeing Flair unify the titles and add to his legacy.

The next match is a US title match between Steve Austin and Ricky Steamboat.  As always this is a great match between the two and if I'm not mistaken this was Ricky's last match in the WCW due to an injury he received.  Classic wrestling, great match.

The next match is another really good one from Clash XXXII when Ric Flair and the Giant take on Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage.  This is a big time match and all 4 guys I thought brought it for this one.  This is also the match where Elizabeth makes her debut.  The fact that Flair and Giant won made me smile ear to ear when I was younger and when I watched it again here recently it made me do it again.

The next match is a women's match from Clash XXXIII between Madusa and Bull Nakano.  These two always put on classics and this one was no different.  Awesome contest between one of the best from Japan and in my opinion the greatest American women's wrestler of all time Madusa.  I'm hoping because they have been putting her (Madusa) on some of the last few DVD releases that maybe she'll go into the Hall of Fame and has finally gotten over the embarrasment of dumping the WWE Women's title in the trash at WCW.

Now we get another head scratcher as DDP takes on Eddie Guerrero for the Battle Bowl ring.  It was a good match, don't get me wrong but neither one of these guys were big stars at the time so I'm not sure why their match was included on this set.  Still though, watch it, cause it is a good match.

The next match is a Triple Threat match with the Steiners taking on Harlem Heat as well as Sting and Lex Luger for the WCW Tag titles.  This is a good match but the ending with the match being declared a no contest kind of took away from it all.  Still worth seeing.

The next match was Ultimo Dragon defending the WCW Cruiserweight title against Dean Malenko.  This match, as is always the case with these two, was very well done and well worth seeing.  I'm not so sure if it was as good as their Starrcade 1996 match for the 9 Cruiserweight titles but it was still worth seeing.

The next match was from the very last Clash and it featured Chris Jericho defending the WCW Cruiserweight title against Eddie Guerrero.  This was another good match and again was another match that was well worth seeing.

The last match was the main event from the last Clash as it was Lex Luger and DDP taking on Scott Hall and Randy Savage.  Honestly, Hall is not worth seeing in this match but everyone else carries the match and makes it well worth seeing.  I can't remember now for the life of me whether we get to see Sting with the vulture at the end but even without that segment it's still worth seeing.

There are some extra matches on Blu Ray and if you bought this at Best Buy you received two bonus matches.  I didn't get either one of these but because I've seen every Clash event I can tell you about the matches.  The first BR match is a tag match with the Midnight Express taking on Ric Flair and Barry Windham.  This was at Clash IV and was a very good match that I wish was on the regular DVD set.  The match goes about 17:00 and does have Flair and Windham going over but this was an instant classic.  The next bonus BR match we get is from Clash XVIII and it features another tag match with Steve Austin and Rick Rude taking on Sting and Ricky Steamboat.  This is another match that I wish was on the regular DVD set but sadly WWE decided to put it on the BR set only.  This is a fantastic match that actually features the top 4 contenders for the WCW World title.  Great contest and well worth seeing.  The final BR bonus match we get is the Thundercage match from Clash XXII as Sting and Dustin Rhodes took on Vader, Paul Orndorff and Barry Windham.  This was yet another match that should have been on the regular DVD set.  Fantastic contest that I believe was originally supposed to be a 8 man tag.  The match was supposed to be Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Van Hammer and Ron Simmons taking on Vader, Rick Rude, Barbarian and Barry Windham.  That would have been good but what you get is even better.  Great contest and also features Cactus Jack turning good.

If you bought this DVD set at Best Buy then there was 2 other matches your could have gotten.  The first one was Hulk Hogan taking on Ric Flair for the WCW World title at Clash XXXIII.  This was not their best match together and I am glad this one was not on the regular set.  It's a terrible match with the two and it ends in DQ, so it's not worth seeing.  The final BB bonus match was the Midnight Express taking on the Fantastics for the NWA US title from Clash I.  This was a pretty good match but again I am glad WWE kept this off the regular set.

So, all in all this is a pretty good set.  Of course there are some matches I wish was on here like:  Sting and Ric Flair taking on Dick Slater and Great Muta from Clash VIII, the Steiners taking on Doom for the NWA Tag titles and also Doom's masks on the line from Clash X, Ric Flair taking on Bobby Eaton for the NWA World title in a 2/3 falls match at Clash XII (this one in particular is one I was suprised was not on the set as it requested a lot by fans), Lex Luger taking on Rick Steiner for the WCW World title at Clash XVII which is a very underrated match, Steiners taking on Steve Williams and Terry Gordy at Clash XIX, Shane Douglas and Ricky Steamboat taking on Steve Austin and Brian Pillman for the WCW Tag titles at Clash XXII, and there are many more that I won't mention at this time.  Here's hoping for Best of the Clash of the Champions Vol II."
1235,1.0,"This was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life! Video Renters Beware, you wouldn't want to rent this movie because of how stupid it is. It was so freaking boring and stupid I wouldn't even want to pay attention to this movie one more time! I HATE it!"
1236,4.0,"When I heard this dvd was going to be released I was so excited.  I was one of the people who used to do the whole underground tape trading.  I loved ECW and I still love watching some of the matches and some of the people who made that company great.  I think this set is a pretty good set but there were some things about it that I didn't like.  One of the things was editing the ECW crowd.  Hell, they were part of the show so I think this was a bad move from WWE.  They should have slapped on a rating for the set and released it like they did the The Rise and Fall of ECW.  Some of the matches were questionable as well but overall it was a good set.

The first match was the tournament finals for the NWA world title between Shane Douglas and 2 Cold Scorpio.  This was a great match and a great way to start the show.  I was always a fan of both of these men, Shane with his technical skills and Scorpio with his high flying ability.  This match did not disappoint.  Of course, the aftermath of this match is what started the whole EXTREME movement.

Up next was a match from Harcore TV between Raven and Tommy Dreamer.  This is truly one of the greatest, maybe the greatest feud, in ECW history.  I remember when Tommy first started with the company and he would come out in his singlet and smile.  The fans would boo the crap out of him until he took his ""caning.""  This was a good match but these two would have many other better matches.  As a side note, this is the debut of Beulah, who would go on to be Dreamer's real life wife.

Could not wait for the next one:  Dean Malenko and 2 Cold Scorpio vs. Eddie Guerrero and Taz.  I refuse to add the extra Z to Taz's name.  That was a WWE thing and this is him competing in an ECW ring not a WWE ring.  This match was awesome from start to finish.  I think Eddie vs Dean may have been the best classic wrestling feud that the ECW ever had.  When these two were in the ring, it was just magic.  I do remember Taz hurting his neck in this one and that hindered the match a little bit but it was still great.

The next match was another great one between Eddie Guerrero and Dean Malenko for the ECW TV title.  About a week prior Dean had won the title so this was the rematch.  This was a great match, however the only bone I have to pick, is this fan in the crowd.  He's at the bottom of the screen and he's standing the whole time!  He is so distracting.  Thank God that Eddie and Dean are so good you watch them rather than this dork who will not sit down!

The next match was Shane Douglas taking on Cactus Jack for the ECW world title.  This was a brutal match between two guys who were trained together.  I like this match but it does feature Cactus doing one of the most disgusting things I have seen anyone do and it involves his spit.  This was the first time that I can remember Cactus having his hands handcuffed and taking multiple chairshots to the head.  He later did that at the Royal Rumber 1999 but you can see an earlier version here and honestly, it may have been more brutal.

After that we get a really good match between Chris Jericho and 2 Cold Scorpio.  This was a good match with a lot of technical wrestling.  I expected more high flying but because they suprised me it made it that much better.

Up next is a ECW tag title match with Sabu and Rob Van Dam taking on the Eliminators in a match where tables and ladders are legal.  Holy crap!  This was a great match.  They had a series of these matches and this one was one of the best.  Another of these matches were released on the RVD set from WWE but this one was even better.  I've always liked both of these teams and was glad this one was on there however I wish the 30:00 draw they had from November 2 Remember 1996 would have been released instead.  Still, this one is definatly worth checking out.

Up next was billed the ""Grudge Match of the Century.""  It featured Sabu taking on Taz.  This was a freaking brutal match.  So many great things about this one.  One thing to look for is Taz ramming his forearm against Sabu's face and breaking his nose.  This match was great but was not the main event of the PPV Barely Legal.  I remember Raven, who was in the main event had a real problem with them two being the only two people on the poster when they weren't in the main event and he was.  Still, this was a great match.  The only thing was confusing, was Bill Alfonso's turn.  It was done kind of poorly.

The next match was an ECW world title match between Bam Bam Bigelow and Shane Douglas from November 2 Remember 1997.  This was a rematch as Bam actually shocked the world and became champ a few weeks prior.  This match here was better and was an instant classic.  There were so many twists and turns that at times it was hard to keep up.  Great match and well worth seeing.  Glad to see Bam featured in a match, he was very underrated.

Freaking loved the next one for the ECW tag titles at Heat Wave 1998.  It featured Rob Van Dam and Sabu taking on Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinaki.  If you love high flying wrestling then this is the match for you.  This match takes place more in the air then it does in the ring.  It is a great one.  It is awesome to see Hayabusa wrestling before his tragic accident in the ring.  If you like to see the Undertaker walk the ropes wait till you see Shinaki walk the ropes.  Sabu is crazy in this one and RVD steals the show as always.  This is one of my favorite matches on the set and I think you will like it too.

The next mach is RVD taking on Jerry Lynn for the ECW TV title.  I'll tell you, if Eddie and Dean wasn't the greatest classic feud in ECW then these guys were.  What a match?  Back and forth, up and down.  This match starts in first gear and never lets up.  This match was great, they had better, but this one was great to see.

The next match was Shane Douglas battling Taz for the ECW world title.  I think at this time Taz had been chasing the title for like a year and this was the match the fans had wanted to see.  It was kind of a let down.  Most of the fans hated it and thought it was too slow.  The fans even chant, ""Boring,"" during the match.  It does pick up toward the end but it was still a let down.

Up next was Lance Storm and Justin Credible taking on RVD and Jerry Lynn.  Lynn and RVD were kind of an experiment but man they made a great team.  This was a dream match and it did not disappoint.  I loved this on and actually, at the time, hoped that Lynn and RVD would stay a team and for RVD to get rid of Sabu.  Great match.

Up next was Masato Tanaka taking on Mike Awesome for the world title.  Awesome match!  These two had a great chemistry and once again it showed in this one.  These two had some insanse chair shots and some insane moves featuring tables.  Loved this one.

The next two matches were from Cyberslam.  The first was Taz taking on Tommy Dreamer for the world title.  This was a good match but I have never liked Dreamer at all so for him to win was just sad to me.  After he beat Taz and FINALLY became champ Justin Credible came out and challenged Dreamer and then beat him for the belt.  This match was a little better but I was hoping someone else would have become champion, maybe Lance Storm.  Kind of bad booking if you ask me.

The next match was Rhino taking on Sandman for the TV title.  This match was good but I hate Rhino so it wasn't that good.

Then, we get Rhino taking on Spike Dudley for the TV title.  This match was better.  I have always considered Spike to be very underrated and this match proves that point once again.  I have to say that I have seen Spike in some big matches, i.e. against Bam Bam, against RVD, etc., and this match was another one of those.  Great match because of Spike.

Up next was Jerry Lynn taking on Christian York.  Lynn is one of the best wrestlers ever and this is a waste of a match with him in it.  It's short and doesn't show you just how good Jerry is.  I would have liked to have seen maybe a world title match with him in it.

The last match was Tajiri and Mikey Whipwreck taking on the FBI taking on Super Crazy and Kid Kash.  Good match and a pretty good way to end the dvd.  I will admit that toward the end of ECW, it was harder and harder to find good matches but this was a good one to include.

The blu-ray set has two matches on it from Night the Line Was Crossed.  This was an event that Paul Heyman told everyone was either going to make the company or break it.  The first one was Tommy Dreamer taking on Jimmy Snuka in a pretty good match.  This one wasn't anything to get excited about but it was still good.  The other one was the one hour draw for the world title between Shane Douglas, Terry Funk and Sabu.  This was a great match that I don't know if it would have worked with 2 other guys than Shane and Terry.  Sabu was ok in the match but Terry and Shane is what held this one together.

All in all a great set.  Some things I want to see for Vol 2:  Some Cactus matches, another Raven/Dreamer match, would love to see a Raven/Sandman match, maybe another Eddie/Dean match, more Taz matches, definatly some more RVD matches especially the RVD vs Sabu match from Wrestlepalooza 1998 TV title match that went to a 30:00 draw, also some more Bam Bam matches like the one where he won the title would be nice, would like to see some Gangasta and Eliminators matches, I also thought Vol 1 was missing the Dudley Boys so would like to see them in a few matches as well.  So many things that I want to see.  Can't wait for Vol 2 and who knows, maybe we'll get a Vol 3 as well.  They'd be stupid not to keep releasing these.  Fans love ECW like a religion, myself included, and these sets are some of the most purchased sets that WWE sell.  Maybe they should provide some matches and let us choose what will be on it like they did with the WWE championship and IC title dvd sets.  Here's hoping."
1237,4.0,"This Anime is truly a really old one. The character hardly move at all (There is tons of standing still, only mouth moving scenes), each episodes story is predictable and the series isn't as perverted as the new Lupin. But is it entertaining? Hell yeah!

The music is one of the highlights here. The theme song consists entirely of a man reapeating ""Lupin the 3rd"" in different tones. The BGM is really awesome too. One infamous track is ""Lupin - Nice Guy"", a song where a man brags about Lupin in weird ways. The intro uses scenes from the episodes, but in a really amusing, 70's kind of way. It's like the cartoons you used to watch when you were a kid. Most of the episodes isn't continuous, so you can basicly watch any episode you watch. The only episode that proves different, is when Goemon arrives.

Since Hayao Miyazaki took over the show after episode 8, there is almost none nudity after this. The first 8 episodes have fanservice, but much milder than today. The story telling is also really good and keeps you glued to the screen for at least 4 episodes! And the detailed characters, it's freaking epic! When was the last time you say an young Anime character with hairy legs and even hands?

This may serve great for people who have never watched Lupin before. Or just Lupin fans who love this guy. This is, by my opinion, the best Lupin series ever. Miyazaki proves to us that Lupin really is a nice guy, even though he is a thief. He is kindhearted, always there for his friends and doesn't shoot people just for fun. The voices fits the characters perfectly, and even though the audio is only available in mono sound (The JP track) the series doesn't get bad because of that."
1238,5.0,"Best episode in series to date, just far freaking out!  Ensemble just pulled off one fantabulous performance from start to finish!"
1239,3.0,"If you're wondering who actually watches and enjoys all of these ""found footage"" films - well, that would be me.  I freaking love ""found footage"" movies, even the bad ones - especially the bad ones from The Asylum.  With so much to make fun of, how can you not enjoy yourself?  Alien Origin is an especially bad treat.  Almost nothing actually happens, and when something does happen, you aren't permitted to actually see any of it.  Don't expect to see any aliens here, as the camera conveniently messes up whenever a possible alien pops up.  As an added bonus, though, the filmmakers throw in some found footage inside the found footage that is the movie.  I'm talking found footage squared here, people.  In all honesty, I can understand why some people are actually calling this the worst film from The Asylum in years.  Of course, as far as I'm concerned, that is exactly what makes Alien Origin such a hoot to watch.

The footage making up this film comes from a squad of Belize special forces sent out into the jungle to perform the dangerous job of nailing some cameras up along some river that has possibly been the site of some activity (probably drugs, but who knows?).  Along for the thrilling ride (or should I say hike) are ""adventure journalist"" Julia Evans (Chelsea Vincent) and her film crew.  You have to love these Belize special forces.  They go into these jungles with fingers on the triggers, constantly sweeping the area like they're expecting Predator to jump out on them at any minute.  And those hand motions.  These guys throw out more signs than a gang member on crack.  Having no military background, I don't know if any of the hand motions they use are actually legitimate, but I strongly suspect that they're just making them up as they go along.  Moving forward, the mission gets changed to a search mission for two archaeologists who have gone missing from a dig site.  That's when the fun really begins, because these missing scientists have found something that was better left unfound.  What is it?  Only the movie description will tell you.

The vast majority of this film consists of these guys making their way through the jungle.  Eventually, they encounter something dangerous (probably an alien) that growls and flings bottle rockets at them, and they try to escape back through the same jungle.  By and large, that's pretty much the whole movie.  Obviously, this is only going to appeal to bad movie junkies like myself - and quite frankly, I had a pretty good time watching this.  Where else are you going to see an archaeologist make the discovery of a lifetime and simply pick it up and throw it in a canvas bag?  Who else is going to make a movie about aliens and then refuse to show you any aliens?  Where else are you going to hear a native of Belize refer to someone as a ""wanker?""  Where else could you find a seasoned special forces soldier jerk and fall down dead from the effects of a bottle rocket that didn't land anywhere near him?  And what other film company is going to have a character continually call out the name of someone who isn't even in the film - and never explain or apparently even notice the mistake?  This is why I love The Asylum - they've taken the art of bad movie making to a level never before imagined.  Don't misinterpret my rating - clearly, this is a one-star movie for the vast majority of the population, but for us wackos who can't get enough of the worst films ever made, Alien Origin is heaps of fun."
1240,5.0,I love this movie because it shows what a freaking IDIOT Sarah Palin is!
1241,2.0,"This movie builds up to one scene of interest and then it ends.
The entire time this movie is playing and a ""piece"" of the ""story"" is revealed I was like well that's interesting now isn't it...whatever will happen by the end?
Answer: the credits will role.
One reviewer compared the ending to be the easy way out and they are so right.
If it wasn't for the freaking handshake you'd have no movie and as far as I'm concerned this is barely a movie to begin with.
ANYBODY can dream up a nice unsolvable mystery and leave it unexplained  that's not talent it's just cheap and a real good way of saying ""I had no idea how to end this"".
There's no point to this movie and there is certainly no closure or even a lame attempt at some.
Watch it if you want but if you're not a fan of the un-answered or un-explained then your gonna want to watch something else."
1242,5.0,"I'm a huge Wes Anderson fan, so I might bit a little biased here. This movie surprised me SO much, in the best way possible. All the big names you went to the movie for are really supporting characters... the kids are the base of this movie. Heartwarming and so freaking CUTE (in a dark independent sort of way, of course). This is now one of my favorites!"
1243,5.0,"I found this listing by accident looking up Night Gallery. I read the reviews and pondered on getting this series. It being on six DVD-Rs really turned me off. If I knew it came from Sony, I would have ordered this sooner! They put out some good DVD-Rs(they did a fantastic job with an oldie called Ladies in Retirement with Ida Lupino). And I am glad I ordered this series! This is killer stuff and very addictive TV viewing. I am only up to disc four but I love it. The only let down is that some of these episodes could have been hacked down a bit. Some just go on and on...
All I know these episodes look fantastic for 1972-73. It is hard to believe these are not pressed because Sony did one great job on restoring and cleaning these episodes up. The sound is nice and solid. And thank you Sony for presenting these in their tv aspect ratios. I have heard several tv series are being processed to fill a 16:9 screen (1.78). That should be a no-no!! What are studios thinking!?
All in all, Ghost Story/Circle of Fear is the greatest (even over my favorite Thriller) horror series from the past. Just glad to have discovered this series! Now I can't wait until daylight so I can watch some more (sorry a little too scary for night viewing).
By the way, if anyone is freaking out about the price, you must realize these DVD-Rs are for a special market and they make only so many. So get it while you can. You won't be sorry."
1244,3.0,"I was SO looking forward to watching this film.  For one thing, how can you go wrong with a cast like that?  But no, the writer/director just had to ruin it with over-the-top violence, gore, and language.  Too bad really; the premise and the screenplay were freaking brilliant.  I laughed almost constantly the first 10 minutes.  The comic relief wasn't enough to lift you over the disturbing stuff though. What could have been just enough violence to convey realism, turned in to a gore-fest about the joy of killing.  Something you'd expect if Quentin Tarantino collaborated on a movie with Charles Manson.  (Why did you have to go THERE, McDonagh?)  Seems like the actors would have said, ""Hey!  Let's tone it down a little!""  I turned it off after 20 minutes or when I got nauseated - can't remember which happened first.

I gave it 3 stars for originality, clever dialogue, and several hilarious lines.  And for Sam Rockwell.  (Note to self:  Use caution next time you start to watch a Martin McDonagh film.)"
1245,4.0,"I didn't find a massively deep message in the movie like so many other reviews on here.  What I did find was one simple idea;

Doing the right thing in a wrong society does not work.  So either learn to do wrong so you can be successful in a wrong society or else push it all the way and start a freaking war to try and right the wrong society.  Either way your morals are going to be compromised in a society gone very wrong.

This movie is kind of in the same realm as 'Falling Down', except this movie is humorous and not serious."
1246,4.0,"INSIDE THE CASE
I was quite surprised to get home and find my Avengers Collection waiting for me on my front porch...a day before it was released.  THANKS AMAZON!!!  Amazon did a great job at packaging this with one protective box packed inside another.  Once I finally got all the boxed open, I saw the shiny briefcase and the colorful Cover box.  As i was trying to get the briefcase out, I accidentally tapped a button, and the shield lit up on the front of the case.....very coooool!!  The case itself looks very nice, and is well-constructed.  Now I have the thing out of the cover box, and am ready to open it.  One minor problem here.  Instead of actual latches on the case, they just sort of snap shut. No biggie, but a minor disappointment.  I lift the lid, and the inside of the briefcase is flooded with a cool blue light, both on the lid and underneath.  The teseract is nesting right in the middle with a cool blue glow around it.  I take the cube out of the box, and notice it is plastic wrapped.  Once the plastic is off, I pull out the battery saver tab and sit waiting for something to happen.  There was no visible switch or anything, so I just guess that I must have to supply my own batteries.  I'll come back to that later.  The bottom part of the case has three-dimensional wires, and circuits, and key pads.  The movies are arranged with the 3-D movies on the left, and the 2-D movies on the right.  I thought that was a neat way to organize them.  The bonus disc is also on the right.

INSIDE THE LID
The lid has a very snazzy holder with the Avengers logo on it, and there are some folders enclosed here.  The first thing you see is a smaller black envelope with ""confidential"" on the front, and ""open immediately"" on the back.  Of course, I do as I'm told.  Inside is an odd looking lenticular sheet with a couple of black and white images in the corners, and some other open windows on it......hmmmm strange.  There is also a nifty little badge with a bar code on one side and ""Field Agent Access Code"" on the other.  There are no instructions as to what to do with this code.....hmmmm stranger. OK, if you want to know what this if for, keep reading.  However, if you would rather enjoy the fun of discovering what this is for, skip to after ""SPOILER ENDS""  OK.........

SPOILER BEGINS!!!!!!!!  OK, if you don't care anything about figuring this out on your own, here's the skinny.  In the black folder, you will find a sheet titled Item 47 Recovered.  Now take your little lenticular sheet thingy and line it up with the two images in the upper left and lower right corners.  Through the little windows you will now be able to read the message that tells you where to go to input this code.  When you get to the site put the code in, fill out the information, and a 5 minute preview begins of Phase 2 of the Avengers Universe.  Let's just say, we're in for a FANTASTIC next couple of years with some AWESOME looking movies.  I'm sure there will be more on this site later on, but that's about all there is at this point...................
OK, SPOILER ENDS.....................

Now, back to the folders.
There is a total of five separate folders.
  * Black folder - This has some info about the Tesseract, along with some dossiers on Clint Barton and Black Widow.  Your certificate of authenticity is also in this folder, although it simply states ""One of a Limited Edition"" no number.  I really prefer a numbered edition, but that's just my preference.  There is also an instruction sheet for replacing batteries in both the case lid and the Tesseract.

  *  Captain America - photo of Steven Rogers, various military documents, trading cards, and an interesting drawing apparently torn from a composition notebook.

  *  Tony Stark - Newspaper article ""Who is the Iron Man?"", blue prints, Lots of other neat little items. (don't want to give it all away)

  *  Bruce Banner - Newspaper article, lecture notes, and other cool items.

  *  Thor - a yellow ID bracelet, strange drawings, drivers license (cool), and some other items

Someone spent some time to make all of the memorabilia in these folders look authentic.  If you're a geek for bonus features like I am, then you should enjoy thumbing through these folders as much as I did.  Oh yeah!!  I also found the instructions for how to activate the Tesseract....when all else fails....read the instructions.

THE DISCS
Ok, now this is where I was a little let down.  I hate it when I sell all of my individual movies to fund purchase of a nice box set like this, only to find out that not all of the bonus features were ported over.  This is a problem only for Iron Man and Iron Man 2.  Both of these movies seem to be simply the first disc of the 2-disc set of blu-rays.  The 7 part doc from Iron Man was nowhere to be found, and NONE of the bonus features from Iron Man 2, Disc 2 are included.  Both 1 & 2 are labeled ""Disc One"", so it looks to me like they just took the current discs out of the 2-disc blu ray and tossed the 2nd disc.  As far as I can tell, all of the others have the features from the original release.  OK, so maybe these extras are what is on the elusive SHIELD disc???????  Sorry....but NO.  That disc simply contains from intros to each film, deleted scenes, animatics, and Pre viz stuff.  That's about it.  I thought, ""Maybe they've ported them over to BD-Live.....ummmmm NO.  The failure to include these two discs is a total mystery to me.  Why would you want a ""complete"" set of movies when two of the discs full of special features is not included?????  That's what keeps this from getting a full 5-star rating.  Some may think I'm nit picking, but it just really aggravates me when I see a set that has been sooooooo long coming to arrive with a less than perfect landing.  While this was not a problem for me, it could be for some.  There are also no digital copies of any of the movies in this set.

FINAL WORDS
So, that's it for my take on this set.  The case if very cool, the folders are so authentic looking, and HOLY CRAP....There's a freaking glowing blue cube in the middle.....what else do you need??  If you do get this, don't throw out disc 2 from both Iron Man movies, or you'll be as disappointed as I am.  Never fear, this set is so freaking cool, it almost makes me want to give it a full 5 star rating anyway.  Naaaaah...don't think so."
1247,1.0,I truly thought this movie was going to be good but it wasn't it was truly a freaking disappointment. For one leave these haunted houses alone leave the dead alone and in the end what happened they all died I REALLY HATED THIS MOVIE.
1248,5.0,"I have been an ""Alex Cross"" fan for a while now and I just love the novel series!  I saw the other two adaptions with Morgan Freeman (a living legend) as our favorite detective, Det. Alex Cross.  ""Kiss the Girls"" was an amazing adaption that captured the world of the novel it was based off of so beautifully and awesome.  As for ""Along Came A Spider""..... no so much.  But I did enjoy Morgan Freeman.

Now comes the next step into the world of Alex Cross and we are getting a ""reboot"" this time.  In this third adaption, we see none other than Tyler Perry take the role as Det. Alex Cross and just unleash his acting skills into making the character come to life.  Thank goodness that his time as ""Medea"" paid off.  And we also get to see new blood into the world as well.  Sure, the movie doesn't exactly remain completely true to the novels, but it does a great job at capturing the dark theme of the novels like ""Kiss the Girls"" did.

Okay, I can understand why people don't like Rob Cohen as a director.  The only movie I ever liked that he made was ""Triple X"".  The guy isn't really that good at making a movie.  No offense to him, it's just the truth.  But despite that the director doesn't really have my attention, the storyline wasn't really that bad.  Sure, it needs some work, but it actually has a great emotional presence that just does a great job at bringing the dark and light themes from the novels and into the movies.

The movie is an adaption of the twelfth novel in series, ""Cross"".  The movie doesn't exactly follow the novel like ""Kiss the Girls"" or ""Along Came A Spider"" did.  In fact, the movie actually borrows from the other novels and also just goes its own way for once.  The only thing that it actually remains loyal to, is the fact that Alex Cross is a honest detective and will do anything to protect his family from danger, while going after a killer at the same time.  Even though the movie doesn't follow the novel very well, it does bring the atmosphere of the novel and the dark presence to life.

The characters are freaking amazing as well!  As usual, we have Mr. Tyler Perry, who not only brings Alex Cross to life with his acting and personality skills, but with his physically presence too.  We even see him as a loving husband and loving father to his kids, which we never saw in the other two movies.  We even get to see him in action as a detective and as a psychiatrist, which we are familiar to, but on a whole new level when Mr. Perry goes to work.  We also have Alex's partner and new character, Det. Tom Kane, who replaces John Sampson from the novel series, but keeps a great relation to John's character.  While Tom isn't really that interesting, he is fun to see around Alex, as they make jokes and talk about their fun times as kids.  We also have the sycho villain, Michael ""The Butcher"" Sullivan!  While he is called the Butcher, his real name is never fully given, except for in the novel.  Michael Fox is at his best as the evil assassin and proves to be one amazing adversary to Alex himself.  Michael makes this character so scary, that you will be praying for Alex's safety against him.  And finally, we have Alex's family.  In the movie, we get to finally meet Alex's kids, grandma, and wife for the first time.  While we do get a glimpse of Janelle and Nana Mama from ""Kiss the Girls"", we finally get to see them having big roles in this movie.  Both Damon and Janelle show us what life is like for Alex as he comes home from work and spends his time with them and also what it is like when they lose someone they love.  Nana Mama is.... well... Nana Mama.  Still Mrs. Grumpy and Bossy lady who is almost just like her ordinary self from the novels, except for the moments when she comforts Alex in hard times, which we don't see in the movie.  Maria Cross, the wife of Alex, is indeed beautiful as they say in the twelve book, with the exception of her personality.  In the past movies, there is no mention of Maria, except for a brief hint in ""Kiss the Girls"", when we see Alex touching his wedding on his finger, referencing to his marriage with Maria.  Her character is do very well in the movie, providing a very emotional moment when a unexpected situation happens.  Trust me, all of these characters are done beautifully!  While some characters have been replaced or personalities changed around, you love every minute of them.

I know that some of you didn't like the storyline or didn't like the directing of the movie, but come on!  The acting and the theme of the movie wasn't all that bad.  There are worse movies out there.  The graphics were okay and the fast-pace was almost like from the novel.  You got to love Tyler Perry and Michael Fox as they bring their characters to life and make the world of Alex Cross real as possible.  I hear that a sequel is going to be made, which will be the thirteen novel, ""Double Cross"".  Please try to help get another movie going, because I can promise you this, if a new director and new scriptwriter help out with this new adaption, the sequel will be way better.  Trust me on that!

So, if you happen to be a fan of the novels, you will love this movie!  Trust me!  Just buy it!"
1249,2.0,"Good performances. But very flawed and lots of lazy writing and direction. The scene were the ""big bet"" is so damn contrived and illogical that it's embarrassing and ruined everything they'd built in the first two acts. And it's freaking illogical. Anyone, especially a bookie knows a double or nothing bet is not a big deal, you just have to make another bet at the same number. You don't need to parlay it or give more points. Lazy lazy lazy.

I also like when Jennifer is listing the scores of the games she was with Cooper ... she mentions the Eagles beating the Seahawks 14-7. Well, they'd said earlier in the film that the Eagles were BEATING the Seahawks 27-10. WTF. How freaking lazy. There's also a scene where Jennifer is taping Cooper's shoe's with duct tape. But in the shot RIGHT BEFORE that his shoes ARE ALREADY TAPED. Lazy."
1250,1.0,"First, let me preface this by stating that I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan. I loved The Dark Knight, Inception, and pretty much everything he has done...until now. I thought this film was entirely too long and stretched out. Even Christian Bale seemed like he was bored to tears for most of the movie. Instead of having him be out for vengeance after Rachel's death Nolan decides to have him retire? Um, no. That's not how Batman would react. You're thinking of Edward Cullen, Mr. Nolan. Anyway after that it's nothing but teleporting Bruce Wayne, heavy handed plot points, and a villain who sounds like he's doing a Sean Connery impression through a wrapping paper tube. You want to know what else was ridiculous? The freaking bomb that is supposed to blow up Gotham. First, it's some green energy crap but it has a timer on it for some reason. Second, why did Bane wait six FREAKING months to have it blow up? Yea, sure, he said it was to torture Bruce Wayne. Whatever, if you accept that logic then thats your problem. If Nolan had cut all of that out though this would have been a much stronger film. No magical back healing. No magic teleporting back to Gotham. No long drawn out scenes where he tries to climb some stupid wall (i get that it was supposed to be some turning point for bruce wayne but it took up like 30 minutes in a movie that was already way too long).

1252,5.0,"WTF......  they didn't ask me or my brother to be in this movie.  when most of the myths and legends are based on our shenanigans and tom foolery from 1998-2002 era.  we must have stole every munger rd street sign in the area.  YEAH the army trail/munger rd sign we had to lasso that thing down.  those things where total P**sy magnents.  ""owwwww youve been to munger rd"".  ""yeah baby (in bruce campbell voice) we own it"" then give sign to girl.  fortunatly for us the statute of limitations is up on that.  but also we used to hide in the woods and run out at the idiots parking by the tracks and scare them into driving off.  i actually didn't make it all the way through the movie fell asleep at a friends but looks like the dude who made it burnt it on his own computer, it was a freaking dvd-r.  jeez why didn't they go door to door in Wayne and get some loot off the rich dudes there to get the dvd's produced.  i don't think they answered the real mystery of munger rd.  WTF happened to the house that was 10 feet from the tracks in 1998 and in 1999 there was no house just demolished. ANYways when they want to do the follow up and get a 30 yr old 250lb dude to play a highscool dude they know who the call."
1253,3.0,"Here's a review of the actual blu ray. This movie is basically the first 10 episodes of the anime series compressed to roughly 70 minutes or 75 minutes with the ending credits. If you've seen the anime then you'll know what to expect. There's definately changes to the story, but it's doesn't change my enjoyment of it. Anyway, the characters look all brand new and younger while the anime they look more rugged and rough. Also, some of the music doesn't match the scenes like the anime does. It's a blood bath of show so the music should match this. Movie is very good but I'm not reviewing a movie, I'm reviewing a blu ray purchase. If you know anything about Viz media, they're cheapos. I love Ranma and Maison Ikkoku and thank God Viz brought them over as Maison Ikkoku is one of my absolute favorite and I never get bored of Ranma. However, with that said, they are still very cheap as far as extras goes and this is no exception. Movie is 3 stars as the hand drawn artworks are freaking gorgeous story is very good. Then you get the CGI portion and they're just horrendous, cheap looking and jar droppingly out of place when it shifts from one scene to the next and most of them are in the fight scenes. This is one star off. The next one is the music. Like I stated before, some of the music simply doesn't fit the scenes to me. Maybe they'll fit to you, but to me, they simply seem out of place. This is 1/2 a star off. The third is the blu ray itself. If you're expecting tons of extras, forget about it. There's absolutely none other than a Neon Alley trailer and some sketch drawings. This is 1/2 star off so I'm giving 3 stars. Still looking forward to the 2nd and 3rd portion and here's hoping the CGIs are done better. If you like the anime, you'll like this movie as well. If you didn't, you probably won't like this. I loved the anime and I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, other than the CGI portions. Oh, I didn't even bother with the English dub as Viz is pretty bad at this portion too and the original dub casts were extremely bad."
1254,2.0,"The trailer looked promising, but the product delivered only disappointment.

The trailer doesn't show us a whole lot in terms of estimating what kind of horror this will be.  Really, we see just enough to know that the acting isn't awful (actually it looks quite good...for a horror flick) and the production value is competitive.  I'll go so far as to say that an unusually good job was done building the plot up to the ""extreme tourism"" trip to Chernobyl.  I liked the characters (enough, at least) and enjoyed a few clever, light-hearted laughs.  Jonathan Sadowski  is charmingly funny and he brings that to the screen here early in the movie.  Characters like his are typically fun to watch things hit the fan.  Makes me think of Grave Encounters (2011), where the jokester finds himself freaking out as he learns ""it's not a joke.""  This flick also features Nathan Phillips, Ingrid Bols Berdal, Olivia Dudley, and Jesse McCartney.

Though a bit prepackaged--a la Wrong Turn past the Cabin in the Woods where the Hills Have Eyes--the premise worked and the creepy setting created the opportunity for some great scenes.  Just the opportunity, though.  While the set design worked, the crux of the movie (i.e., the anthropophagous mutants), was poorly delivered.  Sadly, there are really no special effects at all in this movie.  That is not to say they are bad, but that the way the ""action"" and ""horror"" are presented no effects are really necessary.  Now, horror movies can vary.  Depending on the style they may not need any CGI or fake blood (e.g., Paranormal Activity had minimal FX).  Contrarily, movies in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre vein rely heavily on excellent make-up artists and mutant movies need solid mutant concepts that keep us from saying ""hey that's just like in that other movie with that guy in it that came out last year.""  Well, this was a mutant movie, and no one in the audience could pick one of these mutants out of a line up after seeing this movie.  That's how little you see, and the only blood/guts/whathaveyou is post-attack.  Bummer.

Producer Oren Peli (Paranormal Activity director/producer; PA 2 and PA 3 producer) has a great mind for creepy suspense.  I think he was going for a monsters-driven quite creeper; the reason we never really see more than blurry silhouettes of the flesh-eating antagonists.  This general mystery tactic worked in Insidious (2010), when the creature was some other-worldly specter.  But this movie was advertised as suggestive of The Hills Have Eyes in an abandoned fallout city.  Maybe there was a way to make this work, but Peli didn't find it.

I haven't really addressed the plot...there's not much to say that you don't get from watching the trailer.  Some likeable 20-somethings on a European vacation decide to take an extreme tourism excursion to a village in sight the Ukrainian power plant on record as having the worst ""bad day"" ever.  When they try to leave the car doesn't start.  Then they start dying one by one--and you never see it happen!  The escape strategy never gets anyway, the characters (not surprisingly) don't develop beyond a few cheap lines of dialogue, and there's an inexplicably stupid not-so-twisty ending.

WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD?  Grave Encounters, the Paranormal Activity series and White Noise deliver the creepy suspense desired in this flick.  For hungry mutant redneck whatevers aim for The Cabin in the Woods, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series or Wrong Turn.  For suspense and blood and guts galore: Final Destination 5."

1256,3.0,"Season 1 of Transformers Prime was nothing short of magic.  It's proof that all the kids that grew up on the original truly do want to make it better for their kids.  It was an effort of love and affection for the source material, mired in the feel of the new Hollywood movies.  But season 2 only picks up where season 1 left off, and then quickly falls apart.  Nothing holds this season together.  The main story line is that the Autobots are searching for treasures from Cybertron that were sent to Earth many thousands of years ago.  Who cares.  We just found out in Season 1 that Earth is freaking Unicron!  If you can't top that then why bother.  But apparently the producers thought otherwise."
1257,5.0,This anime is freaking great awesome stupendous everything great in the book I didn't quite Believe them when they said the cowboy bebop type of anime and man it delivers
1258,5.0,"I ended up watching this anime on a whim, and boy was I surprised. I give it a 5 because it doesn't deserve to have a ruined perfect rating, THOUGH, it is not the #1 anime out there. Just a couple quick examples of my pet-peeves:

-During the countless shootouts, 100's of bullets are dodged by simply running sideways.

-This series portrays characters all over the world. It's a nice touch when the cast voices in the proper accent too! But when Balalaika has a russian accent for one episode and then a english one for the rest of the series, it's a little dissapointing.

That being said, these minor downfalls were easily drowned out by the story and character development. The main protagonist was still someone who didn't fit in his environment, but nowhere near as dull/gullible/dum as other series. It's a setting based on a real mercenary org. in South America, so behind the scenes research and character diversity is freaking amazing! It's rare to find myself rooting for all these characters that naturally conflict with each other, and gives you that much more a sense of sadness/torn judgement/excitment when those characters' stories rise and fall.

Also, I use a little internal system to rate shows; If a show makes me ""gasp"" it is definitely worth owning. When I say gasp, I'm not talking an ""Oh Wow"" or ""Aawww"" or ""NOooo"", but a ""Oh my lanta, No F-----g way!"". This show definitely has a ""gasp"" moment.

The last disatisfier of this series is the ending. The fact that the characters are so likable, and the story so action-packed, makes a regular ""season ending"" a no-go. This wasn't even that; literaly comparable to an ending of a random episode in mid-season. I wanted at least some closure for a season ending...

STILL WORTH IT!
DVD case great quality
Watch this series at least if you're not buying."

1261,5.0,"freaking hilarious , cant wait to see this female actor in more comedies. we laughed through the whole entire movie !!!!"
1262,5.0,"Don't watch the trailer or read anything about this before you watch it. It is one of those movies that is designed to keep you on your toes. It is, for all intents and purposes, a cross between Men in Black, the best cop movies, the best cowboy movies, Ghostbusters, The Matrix, and the best Pixar/Disney Animations.  It is not for kids because of the violence and some language. Jeff Bridges is hilarious. Ryan Reynolds plays a great straight man to Bridges. Kevin Bacon shows his range of acting in a movie one would not expect to see him in. The movie is very fast moving and if you blink you WILL miss something. Lots of graphics and sight gags make this a must-see popcorn or pizza movie!

Are you going to ""learn"" anything from it?  No. Folks, it is a freaking MOVIE. Don't get caught up in the topic of the afterlife. Suspend your personal beliefs (Movie Going 101) and just enjoy this epic comic offering."

1264,5.0,"After finally watching the first installment, I sat in for a marathon and watched the second (Dawn). This is such a classic story of jealousy and pride turning a partner to an enemy and causing chaos. The difference in a power trip and a true leader. There are so many moral takes by the end of this film..or I'm just a freaking nerd. I loved it though. I would buy these films."
1265,5.0,"Chris Evans was the perfect choice for Capt. America. He's a handsome, clean-cut guy, but not so pretty that he annoys, threatens, or confuses other guys; he has the charisma and like-able nature necessary for anyone playing Steve Rogers. That's actually a fairly difficult commodity to find in Hollywood. I guarantee some idiot agent or casting director tried to pitch Channing freaking Tatum as Cap for the first film, and that would have been a disaster. I bet someone threw Ashton Kutcher's name out there for consideration when they were casting the first Iron Man. Contemplate that atrocity-that-never-was. But Evans has been excellent in high-tension film roles for years now, from Sunshine to Snowpiercer. He even has experience as a Marvel Superhero, playing the Human Torch in the Not-So Fantastic Four adaptations.

This story is straight from the Ed Brubaker-run on Captain America that is probably the best in the characters' long history, all the way back to Kirby and Simon's origin story in the '40's. Where Brubaker had the Winter Soldier storyline directly follow the Death of Capt. America, directors the Russo Bros. place it squarely within the tightly co-ordinated 'Marvel Cinematic Universe', and it's 'Three Phase Plan' and whatnot (It sounds like a scary political platform, not some ideas on a few superhero flicks). It works well, and the cold war elements of the story don't seem out of place. George St. Pierre has some nice fight scenes in his appearances as a toned down version of Batroc the Leaper, and of course Bucky Barnes makes a surprising reappearance... there were plenty of twists I wasn't expecting, and Scarlett Johansen as Black Widow has been a great addition in all her MCU roles playing the Russian superspy. It almost feels as if she's had a movie of her own, and maybe a Black Widow movie is forthcoming. Or maybe Disney will 'punish' her for the full frontal nudity in 'Under The Skin'. It wasn't long ago Disney did things like that, maybe they still do. Anyway...

The Winter Soldier isn't bearing the burden of telling Cap's origin story (which is really quite lame... superserums?), it just sets off at a crazy pace and never stops. It's as much a classic cold-war style spy thriller as it is a superhero movie. It has moles, and snipers, and hostage-taking mercenaries, and secret SHIELD bunkers containing... well, never mind. It's good. Watch it."
1266,5.0,"Let me start off by saying that this is a great movie, very exciting, action packed, with decent character development and good character interplay and propelling intrigue but a whopping entry in how it changes the Marvel cinematic universe and the future changes it portends.  It practically made me giddy for future Marvel movies.  And, let's just admit it now, Cap is the man!

But before I go on I wanted to admit that I had a hard time coming up with a title for this review as there are so many good choices like:

""An ensemble cast propels this exciting Marvel franchise entry.""
""Absolutely Captastic!""
""Stand up and salute 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'""
""Exciting action, smartly placed humor, and far reaching in scope the new Cap A is a must C!""
""You can't keep a good character dead.""
""A solid cast brings this gritty and bendy bit of intrigue into range for fans and casual viewers alike.""
""Steve Rogers: true blue.""
""Stand at attention for 'The Winter Soldier'""
""Bring back the Russo brothers to direct Cap 3 and they've got my ticket sale already!""
""The Winter Soldier will freeze you to your seat for a solid 2.5 hours.""
""Helicarrier, Helicarrier: is that a gun on your mounting or are you just (un)happy to see me?""

I could go on but I'll stop and finish my review with a few remarks (warning: minor spoilers ahead):

Everything you need to know about this movie is perhaps best summed up in a scene hinted at in the trailer where Steve Rogers is in a large elevator with about fifteen other men and presciently asks them, ""Before we get started, does anyone wish to leave?"" before giving them all a righteous beat down as they swarm over and attack him.  The build up to this scene is nicely handled putting the audience in Cap's boots wondering who he can trust, shows his canniness and awareness as he anticipates what's about to happen, but makes us smile and squirm a little as the film doesn't just launch us into an action moment but develops it so the payoff is extremely satisfying and leaves us smiling and waiting for more, more, more.  And this film delivers as I can think of many moments like that.

There are a ton of nods to important Cap storylines from the comics but the casual moviegoer, who won't catch these, won't lose much as most of what is introduced looks like it will be fleshed out in the future (good news Bucky Barnes/ Sebastion Stan fans!).  Amidst the espionage and intrigue we get healthy doses of Steve Rogers and the Black Widow whose means and methods are sharply contrasted even as they draw solid line distinctions between their beliefs and challenge each other to think about how and why they act as they do.  Are you worried or interested for these two to develop a romance in the flick?  I'll give you a hint at what happens between them romantically: they kiss!  Nick Fury is given his best action piece yet and it is truly exciting.  Sam Wilson (played by Anthony Mackie who is given some great quips) is introduced as the Falcon in both a believable and satisfying way, as is Sharon Carter/ Agent 13.  And Marvel continues to get good acting talent to fill roles.

What's sure to excite, aside from The Winter Soldier character being a solid Cap antagonist--ruthless and deadly--are those post credit scenes with one in particular setting up for the Avengers 2 and a couple of new character introductions.  And lest I forget this movie has a few things to say about politics and how man tries to enact and keep control.  It banks off of that question of would you kill Hitler before he was born if you knew what he was going to do...and would you be justified in doing so?

In many ways ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is the purest Marvel movie that's been put out yet and it's certainly one of, if not, the best standing up there with ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers"".  The scale and scope is just as grand but the film feels intimate in tone.

P.S.  I WANT MY OWN CAPTAIN AMERICA MUSEUM!!!  How freaking cool would that be?!"

1268,2.0,"When the big dramatic payoff of a movie is the King of England eating a hot dog (and whether he'll have mustard), you know you're in trouble.

So it is with ""Hyde Park on Hudson,"" a wishy-washy little movie that has about twenty minutes of actual movie in it. But this story about Daisy Suckley, FDR's distant relative and possible lover, is so painfully padded out that it feels like spending a weekend with a bunch of really dull people you don't like -- and nothing dramatic ever builds up to anything.

Daisy (Laura Linney) is summoned by her sixth-cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Bill Murray), who is the president of the US in the years approaching World War II. She becomes his confidante, friend, and possibly a bit more (see the wandering hands in a field of flowers), while remaining clueless about the exact nature of his relationships with his wife Eleanor (Olivia Williams) and his assistant (Elizabeth Marvel).

The story mostly follows a particular couple of days, when the newly crowned King George VI (Samuel West) and Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) are visiting in hopes of forging an alliance against the Nazis. During the king's stay, Daisy is made not-so-shockingly aware that she is not the only woman in her cousin's life. Will she leave, or settle? And will Bertie eat a hot dog? (Seriously, there is DRAMA over that!)

One question kept flitting through my mind as I watched this movie: What is the point of ANYTHING that is going on? Despite having two potentially interesting stories flitting through it, ""Hyde Park on Hudson"" leaves you with the feeling that absolutely nothing has happened -- or at least, nothing important.

Instead, director Roger Michell focuses on everything that doesn't actually matter in the long-run -- we get a whole scene devoted to FDR's mother freaking out because she doesn't want her son offering cocktails to his guests. RIVETING. About half of the movie is watching the British royals twitter and fuss, and the other half is watching the limp, lifeless Daisy wandering around looking sad. There are a few blow-ups -- Daisy gets angry at FDR, the royals have a tiff -- but they don't lead to anything.

It also has some fairly unpleasant implications, such as that Daisy's life as a second-string mistress is better than anything else she could have, or that FDR cheats on Eleanor because she's just a mean ol' lesbian. The movie even implies that the ONLY reason that America became embroiled in World War II was because George VI charmed Americans by eating a hot dog. It's almost farcical.

About two-thirds of the way through the movie, there IS a twenty-minute period that is both charming and powerful -- most of it is devoted to Bertie and FDR having a candid talk that exposes both their vulnerabilities and feelings about each other. It's a lovely, low-key scene... which ends when we get back to the effing hot dogs.

The casting is a pretty mixed bag. Murray is absolutely transcendent as FDR, capturing mannerisms, attitudes and a gentle, genial sense of humor -- he deserves a better movie around this performance. Samuel West is obviously overshadowed by the ""Bertie"" of Colin Firth, but he's quite good as a young, green king who gains some confidence from his paternal American counterpart.

Unfortunately, Laura Linney is utterly wasted here -- Daisy is a dowdy, perpetually downtridden blank with little personality of her own. And Colman is horrendously miscast as the Queen Mum, coming across as brittle and neurotic, like a suburban housewife who needs some Xanax.

""Hyde Park on Hudson"" is a movie entirely made to win awards, not to be a story unto itself -- a few good performances and a few beautiful scenes, adrift in a soup of mediocrity."

RIVETING. About half of the movie is watching the British royals twitter and fuss, and the other half is watching the limp, lifeless Daisy wandering around looking sad. There are a few blow-ups -- Daisy gets angry at FDR, the royals have a tiff -- but they don't lead to anything.

It also has some fairly unpleasant implications, such as that Daisy's life as a second-string mistress is better than anything else she could have, or that FDR cheats on Eleanor because she's just a mean ol' lesbian. The movie even implies that the ONLY reason that America became embroiled in World War II was because George VI charmed Americans by eating a hot dog. It's almost farcical.

About two-thirds of the way through the movie, there IS a twenty-minute period that is both charming and powerful -- most of it is devoted to Bertie and FDR having a candid talk that exposes both their vulnerabilities and feelings about each other. It's a lovely, low-key scene... which ends when we get back to the effing hot dogs.

The casting is a pretty mixed bag. Murray is absolutely transcendent as FDR, capturing mannerisms, attitudes and a gentle, genial sense of humor -- he deserves a better movie around this performance. Samuel West is obviously overshadowed by the ""Bertie"" of Colin Firth, but he's quite good as a young, green king who gains some confidence from his paternal American counterpart.

Unfortunately, Laura Linney is utterly wasted here -- Daisy is a dowdy, perpetually downtridden blank with little personality of her own. And Colman is horrendously miscast as the Queen Mum, coming across as brittle and neurotic, like a suburban housewife who needs some Xanax.

""Hyde Park on Hudson"" is a movie entirely made to win awards, not to be a story unto itself -- a few good performances and a few beautiful scenes, adrift in a soup of mediocrity."
1271,5.0,"Watchmen is one of the greatest comics ever written. And this film perfectly captures everything that's great about, even adding some neat new details. This set in particular is very well-done. It is, of course, the Ultimate Cut, which comes to 3 1/2 hours. It is a bit of a long sit, but worth it, as it includes The Tales of The Black Freighter segments intermixed with the actual movie. The extras are also really nice, there's an episode of a fictional talk show with Hollis Mason, one of the original superheroes from the 40s. The creators of this film really work hard to create and expand this universe, even if it's small things like that. The comic included is nicely crafted, it's hardcover, and the inner pages feel new, but they're not all fancy and glossy, it still kinda feels like an old comic. The dust jacket is also nice to look at, even though, personally, I really hate dust jackets. Definitely the best thing about the film is the casting, specifically, Jackie Earl Haley as Rorschach. He manages to capture of his insanity, depression, determination, twisted morals, and even his strange likability he still has to a freaking ""T"". That being said, I couldn't help being a just a tad disappointed with the cast, I'm just attached to who I'd pick for the roles, but my picks would only work in an animated movie. I'd love to see Steve Blum as Rorschach and Maurice LaMarche as Doctor Manhattan. I highly recommend this to any comic book fan."

First off - New Zealand is the most beautiful place on Earth and when you realise how little CGI was used on the landscape you will quit your job and move. Plus - seriously - The All Blacks!

So, Sherlock Holmes, I mean Smaug dies in like the first 10m (literally 10:42m) from a father/son bonding moment involving an specific arrow.  The town in in flames and most people scatter to shore.  Love-sick dwarf decides that girl from Lost, who is now a middle-class elf, is not worth it and leaves her on the shore. More on the 'Republican' sickness that is eating away at Thorin (lust for money and power). The girl from Lost is banished and Orlando-Dreamy-Bloom defies his father for love. Cate-Breathtaking-Blanchett, Queen of the Elves, can do no wrong and conquers evil and rescues Gandalf (oh Ian, how you make me swoon). Watson, I mean Bilbo, reveals he has the King's Jewel, conundrum abounds. Then we have like 10 hours of everyone trying to convince each other to work together to fight the REAL enemy and not each other (if only people could realise this). Long pauses of thought... hard decisions, overcome petty justifications to NOT help each other... blah. Over an hour in, the 'battle' actually starts. MASS amounts of CGI. The elves are quite shiny. Thorin is still being a hassle. Fight Fight Fight.

Oh wait, let's stop here, in the middle of a freaking battle, and catch up on each others lives. While arrows are flying all around us. Because this is logical. Why not some tea and biscuits?

at 1h 24m, Thorin realizes he's not a Republican and says sorry. Another 6 hours of fighting and CGI. Watson wants to fight. The girl from Lost goes against totally hot Lee Pace for the honour of the dwarf who left her on the shore 10 years ago. More fighting. blah.

Saddest moment in the film - Dwarf and Lost girl reunite, as he dies. This pissed me off. I mean come on... This is Romeo and Juliet stuff we have here. They love each other. They overcame centuries of animosity between the races to find love. The he dies. I call BS!

Half the cast dies. Then - seriously - Watson and Ian toke up like nothing happened and decide it's time to go home. really?

And the tie-in to The Lord of the Rings.

End Credits song - Billy Boyd - this man in amazing.

I love Tolkien. I love fantasy. I love how Peter Jackson brought these books to the screen - gathering up the original illustrators, Alan Lee and John Howe (such respect). The actors, locations, music... movies you can get lost in and believe all of this actually happened. Leaning that life is a struggle, and we befriend people along the way would have never thought we'd meet. We win and we lose, we find love and our heart are broken. People leave us while we find commonalities with those we never imagined.

but, these movies go on... and on... and then some. That said, I will still watch them over and over!!"

1276,5.0,"Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Victoria B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

I went to see this movie with my mom and she was freaking out and covering my eyes in some parts, I thought it was funny and that she was overreacting.  After the movie I had to remind her that I am fourteen.  This movie is about a married couple of thirty-one years, Kay (played by Merryl Streep) and Arnold (played by Tommy Lee Jones) who love each other so much, but have not been affectionate or intimate with each other in many years.  They even sleep in separate rooms, and on anniversaries they get gifts not for each other, but for the house.  Kay gets sad at the reality that she and her husband do not have a real relationship.  So she gets a book about marriage and calls the couple's counselor and schedules the intense therapy to fix her marriage.  At first Arnold refuses to go, but then reconsiders when Kate leaves without him, then reluctantly he goes with her because he does not want to lose her.  All throughout the movie Arnold is uncomfortable with therapy, and especially the intimate tasks assigned by Dr. Fields (played by Steve Carrell).  While Kay really wants to have a ""real"" relationship, Arnold is tentative and they battle with this throughout the whole movie.  This movie was very sweet in a weird way because it is based around an older and very in love couple that struggles with intimacy and I guess for a young audience, that visual would gross them out.  The soundtrack in this movie reminded me of music in a silent film because music is included in most scenes and they describe the scene, even if the words are not there.  Tommy Lee Jones is very versatile as an actor.  I have never seen him play a domestic character or anyone in a relationship, it is refreshing and he does a great job.  This movie makes me see the power in love and determination to sustain it.  My mother was shocked by some scenes but then laughed, so this would be a great movie for couples who are in a long relationship.  This is a very intriguing movie, I have not seen many with this concept, so I give it five out of five stars.  I recommend this movie for mature 13-year-olds and up. This is a good movie for a mature crowd.

1277,1.0,"The creators of this movie took everything that was wonderful about the previous movie and threw it away. McCoy never has anything to say that any other character could not say for him (might as well have put him in a red suit). Spock is dumb. The girls (and yes, all the women characters are just girls) are freaking annoying. All the care that went into making the relationships that fueled the sci-fi believability in the first movie is missing here. I watched it once and thought it was okay. I watched it again and realized that it Michael Bay sucked.

If you want to compare with other movies. I LOVED the first Bourne movie, was okay with the second and fell asleep in the third as it failed in exactly the same way as this sequel did. (OF COURSE I loved the bad guy, but thirty seconds of cool bad guy glares only gets you through a couple of handfuls of popcorn. I super-sized for naught."
1278,5.0,"Wow! 2 awesome sequel movies in a year?! (ie. Ironman) I purchased both thru amazon download and wish I'd bought the hard copies for special features. Super funny, great characters (the casting person should get an Oscar).
Only critique: basing part of the movie on a prior movie and then DRASTICALLY changing that part seemed lame. Not a huge Trekkie so I'm not freaking too much, but I get their angst. Didn't change how awesome the movie was, so I'm sticking with 5 stars of fun."
1279,4.0,"This movie pissed a LOT of trekkies off because they didn't follow hardly any of the original movies (The director bothered to watch some of the movies, but not catch all of the details...) I think they did a HORRIBLE job of re-enacting Kane (The bad guy) The Kane from the original Star Trek 2 Wrath of Kane, was freaking creepy (Esp because of the mullet!) This one they made WAY too refined...

Yet, I gave it 4 stars because I feel that it was a great movie, and shouldn't detract people from watching it if they've never seen a star trek movie (Even though they may not get half of the references)"
1280,1.0,"Star Trek Into Darkness is a boring, unintelligent throw up ride filled with lens flares and flashy, at-lightening-speed action scenes with handsome, sexy, two dimensional characters flashing their sexiness in front of said lens flares, reciting Star Trek jargon; This movie was a complete piece of trash as Star Trek.. It was an even worse dumbing down of a great sci-fi franchise to fit the attention span of the Jersey Shore generation than the first one by Abrams. The sheer fact of plagiarizing a past story devoid of all the emotional weight and resonance is probably enough to relegate it there.

J.J. Abrams is obviously a Star Wars fan - everything in this movie (and the one before it) indicates that.

The distinction between the two began to collapse altogether with J. J. Abrams's first Star Trek film in 2009, and its demise was rendered official with the news early this year that the director would also be taking over future installments of the Star Wars franchise. Abrams's latest outing, Star Trek Into Darkness represents a final burial.

Let's face it, the man is not hired to produce quality movies, he is hired to produce marketable junk. And that he did. So much budget and money and all they could come up with was this boring junk of a tourist trinket that absolutely did not add anything to the world of Star Trek. Seriously. Absolutely nothing.

The movie ruminates loudly, if never very coherently, about the typical fight of good vs evil that is so central to the theme of Star Wars; about war and peace, vengeance and justice, preemptive attack and negotiated settlement. Kirk and Spock having a destiny to be friends - as if the fabric of the universe as we know it would collapse if these two did not become friends or as if their friendship - among billions out there - was the one that had to transcend time and space. As if their friendship was the Jedi of friendships without which there can never be good in the universe. Completely absurd.

Star Trek never cared for creating messiahs or holy men and the only time they did (Sisko as the Emissary) turns out that those prophets the Bajorans prayed to were beings existing on a different plane of existence.  No magic was in place. No destiny and messiah. Why these two _need_ to be friends eludes me. To bring the force and balance to the universe? So much so that the one message the old Spock had for humanity in this alternate timeline was not one on how to prevent wars and genocides and numerous atrocities but how these two need to remain friends no matter what timeline they are in? It is imperative to not divulge information regarding other events since they must fulfill their destiny as the old Spock put it, but it is ok to give Spock and Kirk pointers about their friendship that just must transcend time and space?

Star Trek has always been about real people, however, not archetypes fulfilling destinies. Unlike Star Wars, Star Trek is not a fairy tale of good vs evil, heroes vs. villains. In Star Wars everyone is either a guru, a princess,  a chosen one but none of them - with the exception of Han Solo - was a real person. They were archetypes fighting the typical fight of good vs evil. Chosen prince vs dark emperor. We never find out what the force really is, what creates it and drives it. It is juts there and the story is about how to make the ""force"" work for you. That is entering a multitude of fairy tale territories, not science fiction.

Note that science fiction is a ""what if"" scenario in which the effects of technology or technologies that currently do not exist are explored. Thus, it is ""fiction"" that revolves around such ""science"".

In Star Wars, we do not have any of that. It is neither about humans (since there are no humans in Star Wars, just people called such) nor about the effects of science. In this case, the light saber and  hyperdrive may as well be Excalibur and chariots.

Star Trek has also never had to rely on magical tricks and such to make the stories work. It's characters were real. Real people with real problems; with hopes, dreams, goals and careers - not abstract heroes fighting the good fight for the sake of fighting the good fight or taking revenge.

All that has changed ever since Abrams has added his Star Wars flair and preference to the Trek world.

The action sequences are plentiful and characterized by a certain gee-whiz exuberance. This being an Abrams/Lindelof venture, there are multiple sets of Daddy Issues to resolve. And we are subjected to an escalating experiment in the human tolerance for lens flare.

The entire realization and reimagination of the Trek universe is just an insult to Gene Roddenberry and the Star Trek he had imagined starting with The Original Series to all the subsequent shows and movies under Roddenberry's and then his co-creator Rick Berman's supervision. And I am not talking about setup and scenery, I am talking about the themes inherent in Star Trek. This movie does not honor Roddenberry's vision at all.  It is not intelligent or thought provoking. It is not about space exploration and asking the tough questions, it does not truly establish and explore its characters and their relationships with one another, there is no attempt at science, philosophy, morality and in understanding other cultures.

If it was not for the Star Trek lingo and names of familiar characters, I would not believe that this is a Star Trek production. The plot holes are gaping and the internal consistencies - regardless of past productions - are staggering and too much to ignore. Here are just a few:

1) Apparently orders are purely optional in this here Abrams' Star Trek. No one follows anyone's orders. If you don't wanna follow an order, just resign your commission and hang out in a bar and wait to be reinstated. Don't worry about a court martial or any kind of consequences. Abrams and his writers have completely failed to understand how military hierarchies work.

2)Spock has been turned into a pedantic, stickler who seems to delight in sticking it to others (such as Kirk). He has none of the humor or the pathos that Prime Spock did in The Original Series or the movies.

Mr. Quinto's idea of being a Vulcan is apparently just having no facial expression. That's all. Other than that, he's pretty emotional. Even with a bad script, Nimoy could add just a little something to indicate the depths of his character. Quinto adds nothing. He is mechanical when Spock is logical, and a blubbering tool when Spock is emotional. There's no middle ground, no subtlety, no mystery. Logic is an attitude, a way of life - you breathe, live, think and walk logic. It's not just lack of facial expression and pointy ears. Quinto's Spock with its fake, stagey references to logic and over usage of Star Trek lingo was beyond annoying and obviously placed in there not by people who actually understand, know and care about Star Trek but by people who've done their research and are strategically employing the lingo into the script and dialog to make it ""Star Trek"".

Finally, the Uhura romance: it is hard to believe that Spock, who in this portrayal is a pedantic prissy a$$ bent on enforcing all rules no matter how picayune, would have a sexual relationship with one of his students. It just makes no sense, and it smacks of writers trying to ""sex it up,"" logic be damned.

3) Kirk and Spock have absolutely no chemistry, and thus no camaraderie, between them. Or maybe it is Pine and Quinto. I don't know. Something is amiss. There is no basis for their friendship. In fact, there is nothing to indicate in the behavior of either that they even like each other, much less view each other as friends willing to sacrifice themselves for the other - as they did in the end. Nothing in the story indicates that, except for a script that expects us to just fill in the blanks in that regard.

If I had only seen this and the previous movie, I would be absolutely clueless as to why these two are friends. In order for Kirk's sacrifice to evoke emotional resonance and make us want to care as the audience, it has to have meaning - which is to be found in the friendship. Here, no friendship has been established, only animosity. That was the case in the first movie and it is the case now as well.

In The Wrath of Khan, even if you had seen nothing else from Trek, it was established in several scenes on screen that these guys are life long friends who care a great deal for each other. There are birthday presents, meaningful conversations about life and mortality, there are bonding moments between Kirk and Spock that make their friendship meaningful and give both characters depth and nuances.  This, in turn, allows the viewer to put the death scene in context.

Here, there are fistfights explosions and insults. That's it. This is their ""friendship."" So when Kirk sacrifices himself for Spock you cannot help but feel  a little lost. It is still unclear to me how Kurtzman and Orci get paid millions to come up with such lousy stories. This is not even about Star Trek or anything, this is just pure story telling - or lack thereof. Characters need to behave in ways that make sense and naturally follow from the story and actions of the characters - not just be implanted there because it is convenient.

When Kirk said ""I want you to know why I saved you on the planet,"" I thought to myself: ""Yeah! Me, too!""

Spock yelling ""Khan!!!!"" belied the characterization of Spock, as well as being an expression of emotion that was unearned. But more importantly: KHAN WASN'T RESPONSIBLE for the malfunction on the ship that Kirk ""sacrificed"" himself to rectify. If anything, Spock should have been yelling ""MARCUSSSSS!!""

4) Star Trek, unlike Star Wars, is not driven by special effects and CGI. Special effects can't make you laugh, or cry, or care about anything or anyone. If nearly every scene consists of numbing space battles and CGI monster battles, it just gets tiring. The cacophony of action sequences just got boring after a while and it just felt gratuitous and pointless.

5) Star Trek didn't have the benefit of metric tons of money to blow on effects (Well, real Star Trek doesn't, anyway). Instead, it had to make us care about characters, cultures, and organizations. I cared more about Captain Kirk dodging a foam rock than I ever cared about Obi-Wan McGregor fighting General Grievously Stupid. And I also don't care about Kirk going after the sociopath Khan in this movie either - because I was never given the chance to care about Kirk in the first place.

Watching scene after scene of ""pew-pew-pew-KABOOM!"" just is not appealing to me. And that is the problem: nothing intelligent happens in this movie. There are battles and wars every once in a while in Star Trek, but mostly, there are science fiction stories that describe the universe and its societies, instead of blowing them all up.

6) The Klingons and Kronos: the former looked nothing like the Klingons we have ever seen in any Trek version and Kronos looked like a freaking sound stage. The bridge of the Enterprise still looks like a Bloomingdale's make up counter and more technologically advanced than the slip stream drive ships of 2378 in Star Trek: Voyager. Dialog and ""character"" development consist of ""Bones"" making a weird face and cracking lame jokes, putting a newbie in charge of engineering because the chief engineer decided to not follow orders and Uhura making the brilliant observation and complaint about Spock having no feelings and not showing them to her. Well, no NO KIDDING GENIUS. When did that occur to you? When he said he was VULCAN and on his way to embrace only logic?

7) Overall, the aliens, the action scenes and overall demeanor of the show resembled more a Star Wars meets Transformers meets Jack Bourne production than Star Trek. The story did not revolve around the effects that these technologies, such as eugenics in this case, have or had on Humans and their society. In fact, they did not explore, comment on or critique the Eugenics wars at all - something which is a central theme for the Khan arc and especially central to the concept of Star Trek - which is all about how technology and science affect humans/humanoid civilization and life as opposed to just chasing down archetypes of bad guys while rewarding the ""good guys.""

8) Boy the directors must have studied Memory Alpha since their new favorite word used was the Prime Directive. And don't even get me started on the Section 31 garbage stolen from DS9 and misplaced in this universe. And then that ""permission to come on the bridge"" garbage by a stowaway bimbo in a short skirt whose principle role in the film is to appear briefly in her underwear, thus achieving the dual purposes of supplying Kirk with a romantic interest for the next installment and also being an expert in weapons of mass destruction? WTF?

9) One of my expectations, which is apparently a foolish one, was that the iconic Khan Noonian Singh, a Sikh character, would not be whitewashed and played by a white, British guy, Benedict Cumberbatch, but by someone of East Indian descent or maybe at least someone resembling someone from such a background. With his casting choice of a Caucasian man in the form of Cumberbatch, J.J. Abrams has proven that he doesn't even humor us anymore. He didn't even attempt to make the character at least resemble  someone with East Indian origins.
Roddenberry's vision, I think not.

Now before people jump my throat saying that the original Khan wasn't played by an East Indian either, consider this: back in the 60s, when Ricardo Montalbn was cast to play Khan (a character explicitly described in the episode script of ""Space Seed"" as being Sikh, from the Northern regions of India), he had huge racial barriers and bigotry to overcome in a society where racism and segregation were institutionalized. The pressures Roddenberry faced from the television networks to cast ""sensibly"" as he put it were immense and serious and are well documented. Therefore, for the 60s and the times he was in, having a brown-skinned man (Montalbn) play a brown character was a hard-won victory.

Fast forward some 40+ years later where apparently despite all our changes as a society supposedly embracing diversity, inclusion and otherness, we see that not only has nothing changed with respect to executive demands for ""sensible"" casting, but we see that said producers and film makers are not even trying to hide their attempts at bigotry.

Just this week Abercrombie and Fitch was under fire (as they have been for years now) for portraying their brand and image towards the run-of-the-mill homogenous blonde, blue eyed, chiseled-ab folks. Yet here we got a movie that does exactly the same thing, and people think it's a hit and brilliant and supposedly so very true to Gene Roddenberry's vision.

Really?

It's disappointing and demoralizing that with the commercial power of Star Trek in his hands, JJ Abrams chose not to honor the original spirit of the show, or the symbolic heft of the Khan character, but to wield the whitewash brush for ... what? The hopes that casting Benedict Cumberbatch would draw in a few more box office returns?

10) The characterization of Khan in this movie was just plain wrong and reduced Khan just to the archetypal villain as opposed to a complex, brilliant character.  The Khan from Space Seed was ruthless, but he wasn't cruel for cruelty sake. He was a tyrant, not a sociopath, and there's a big difference. He marooned the crew of the Reliant, he didn't kill them. in cold blood. Khan in this movie, on the other hand, crashing the ship and, in particular, the -violence on the bridge of the Vengeance was really awful and depicted Khan as nothing but the archetypal villain rather than the intelligent, brilliant, and ferocious man that he was.

Overall I think that as a story about revenge and anger (if you don't care about anything else and are a teenager, that is) it's pretty OK. Khan is a maniac terrorist. Boo, we hate terrorists. Check. Kirk hates this particular terrorist because he gunned down his surrogate daddy. Yay, we like revenge! Check. Love story between the withholding man and hot woman who is crazy about him. We love love stories. Check. Obligatory blonde model-slash-actor superfluous character to add a young and sexy ""edge"" to the show plus a possible love interest for Pine, Yaay! We all want to see him hooking up with a blonde model -slash -actor, yaay! Check.

I guess it works on a very broad scale. But the question now is, how many more vengeance and anger stories can be told? Kirk is running out of daddies, and now death can be cured with a handy injection, whatdo'ya know. Isn't that nifty?

Since this was a reboot of the franchise and conveniently taking place in an alternate timeline, the writers were given a white canvas to work with and come up with new ideas and ways to imagine the Trek Universe and take out heroes on journeys they have not gone yet, not rehash the past and redo something, such as The Wrath of Khan, that was brilliant as is and did not need redoing.

Alas, there are alien creatures to be chased, fugitive baddies to capture, Klingons to stare down, and special effects budgets to be spent. Therefore, enter the openly dizzy way that is Star Trek as only a Star Wars business-man fan can imagine it, namely as a more recognizable heir to George Lucas than to Gene Roddenberry.

As a side note: I am tired of hearing people excuse all the crap writing and lousy inconsistencies as ""well it is the parallel universe."" So what? You don't need to create engaging characters we care about, internal consistency, great story telling and a great script because it is the parallel universe? Or alternate timeline? I also have to agree with someone else who mentioned that Abrams is actually doing the franchise a huge disservice. The stuff that's been going down in this and also the previous movie is the kind of lazy bu.ll crap that takes my evaluation beyond ""these are simply bad writers"" and into ""these people actively disdain the thing they've been entrusted with.""

In the end when Khan had his torpedoes or whatever directed at ""Enterprise"" I was really hoping he kills all these losers and puts an end to this terrible reimagination of the Star Trek franchise by a Star Wars fan."
1281,2.0,"This movie was terrible.  This is nothing more than the Transformers version of Star Trek.  Heavy on fluff, and light on substance.  JJ  Abrams is a hack who's limited bag of tricks is always evident.  He couldn't even come up with a new plot for the movie.  No, he gives us a copy of Star Trek 2.  He also manages to copy quite a few things from the last movie as well.  Kirk sleeping with an alien, more Spock tantrums, Uhura chasing after boyfriend Spock, Kirk and Pike drinking in a bar, old Spock giving advice, another scene of people flying around in the bullet shaped space suits, etc.  Oh, and the movie also sports a dozen more lens flares.  That never gets old, JJ.  Then of course you have his copying of scenes from Star Trek II.  What's a matter, JJ, can't come up with your own stuff?  Some of the things that Abarms does in these movies defy logic.  The guy hates transporters.  He looks for every possible way to avoid their use.  Why?  Who knows.  He's a freaking weirdo.  I was laughing when I saw the Klingons dropping from tethers from their ships.  LOL.  Yeah, that made a lot of sense in the 23rd century.  However, then he introduces us to long range beaming.  Huh?  Why would we need ships to get around if you can do that?  Didn't think this through very well did we?  That's okay, just insert another explosion.  Oh, well.  Another point I want to make is the characters.  Aside from Kirk being the worst captain in history, he also has very little chemistry with Spock.  Zach Quinto is a great actor and does a convincing Spock, but the relationship between the two falls flatter than a tortilla.  It's the poor writing that does them in.  How can these two possibly become this close of friends with that attitude that Kirk shows?  I wasn't buying it at all."
1282,1.0,"OMG and Abrams has the gall to call this Star Trek?  Star Trek had morals, humans were out of their infancy and were exploring the galaxy. ENTER JJ ABRAMS.
Last movie was good.  Even though they destroyed Vulcan.  As a fan I could see the crew and the Federation overcoming alot of hurdles to make a brighter future. Nope. Not in Abrams playbook. He brings in the worst kind of campy sci/fi, leeching off of Wrath of Khan, and effectively changing fundemental character traits in the cast. (You know 'new' timeline...) Spock is changed from a loyal commander who was willing to take chances (Anyone remember the Menagerie?) to a whining, disloyal crybaby. Kirk at least makes sense. Still the rebel, but without the discipline of the Academy. The new Scotty, is so freaking irritating, I'd give alot to boot him into the warp core. Mccoy is decent. And this romance between Spock and Uhura should never have been written in the first place.  Now it is getting to be really annoying. Abrams is changing basic character traits that shouldn't have been affected. He is manipulating Star Trek, with nods to TOS, to appease the fans,to get new interest. The Universe is not even recognizable as Star Trek except for the names. He is taking too many liberties just for the almighty dollar. If Roddenberry had still been alive, he would never have allowed this movie. And in my opinion, Abram needs to get back ontrack, or shove off."
1283,3.0,"It's ok with alot of people freaking out about nothing, but who in the heck carries a camera in final confrontation makes the whole premise of reality TV seem incredibly ridiculous."
1284,3.0,"We come in piece. This is the first animated movie from 2013 that I have watched. As well as this being the first animated movie off 2013, which was released. Well I don't know how to start this review. I can kinda tell you that this is sort of a ""Planet 51"" kinda take. It's different from Planet 51, but only in who goes to the other planet, as in alien goes to earth, instead of human goes to mars deal. Escape from Planet Earth, I never actually thought the movie was ever going to be released, I mean I've heard about it scent's 2010. That's a long time. I thought this movie was going to be shelved, which thankfully it wasn't. The movie was sold off to audiences as an actually funny movie, which according to me and my father (who viewed the movie with me) was a lie. This movie is not that funny. The only thing I found funny was in the trailer which showed the alien voiced by Craig Robinson, eating something and burping, which actually was a deleted scene. Talk about false advertisement. Well anyways let me do the honors by  giving off the problems with the film, they include  the voice cast, jokes, dialog alignment with characters mouths, plot,  product advertisements, and characters.  The voice cast. Wow, I never ever thought I'd criticize a freaking voice cast, but I did have issues with the voice cast, not everyone, just some. I mean everyone works, but I think the voice cast could have been chosen better. Ok, I mean this is something that gets me angry, you have really talented unknown voice actors, who would better perfect the characters but instead you pick up a bunch of random known actors who have NO idea how to voice act, and throw them into the movie. That's what I hate about it. Studios all ways do this. They think it will get people to see the movie, which it will but...... you know what I mean? I have no issues with Rob Corddry, Ricky Gervais, Steve Zahn, and William Shatner. But it's the random addition of actors like Craig Robinson, George Lopez (who isn't horrible, but could have been replaced), Jane Lynch (yes, I know I loved her in Wreck it Ralph but not in this), and Sofia Vergara. The others are all ok they are not perfect, and could have been replaced but I didn't feel they needed to be mentioned. Craig Robinson, as the alien, named Doc, who is a neat, small little mousey alien. I felt Craig didn't fit the small little, cared, furry ball that Doc, is. And George Lopez, who had previous voice work, could have been replaced as well.  Jane Lynch, while her voice fit in well in ""Wreck it Ralph"", she doesn't sound right as an alien, and it's just comes out  ridicules as alien IO.  And as for Sofia Vergara, she is horrible as the alien love interest to Brendon Fresher's Scorch Supernova. Her voice is so ugly and bland, and uninteresting; it is like ahhh, whenever her character is on screen. This movie, from the trailer looks like a decent funny kid's movie, well it's not funny. At all. I never laughed once, during the movie. The only thing I think anyone would find funny is when the fat guy's towel is  blow off, revealing his doddle and butt. But even that isn't that funny. My dad who watched with uncomfortable eyes kept a straight face threw out the movie, and my dad is the kind of guy who laughs at a lot of stuff. It's sad really. This is new too. I really had trouble  with watching the movie because, the characters lips talked and shut and the dialog would come out right when the mouth is shut, and it's very distracting, and a sign of poor work, from the animators. That was annoying for me.  This plot is a simple, - strong guy gets stuck somewhere, and weaker one has got to save him. It's a basic, kid friendly plot, which isn't always that good. I've seen that plot a million times over before. But little kids will love it. Man! I never thought a movie could feature so much product advertisement! I mean Escape from Planet Earth features a lot of product placement for 7 Eleven.  I mean both aliens, end up landing and going near 7 Eleven and one walks on in and get's a slushy from two alien fanatics. I have no idea what this has to do with the movie but... ok? That was annoying. These characters are one dimensional basically. Almost every character is thinly written out, and has no back story, basically. It makes for a less spectacular journey. Now onto the good things this movie was able to pick up they include, the animation, and Rob Corddry. The animation in this film is beautifully rendered. I mean everything looks beautiful, I mean like the ship, that Scorch travels in at the beginning is beautiful. Everything is so well detailed, it's crazy. I mean the 7 Eleven is well done as well. Even the slurpee used in the film glimmers. The alien planet ""Baab"" looks magnificent! Everything is brightly colored and lit well; it's very cool to look at. That is something kids would enjoy. Lots of eye candy to look at. Very - Very beautiful.  Rob Corddry. Man, that guy, was (for me) an excellent choice for the voice of Scorch Supernova's older, and over shadowed brother Gary Supernova. Rob, put an extra effort into molding Gary's voice, to perfection. Rob Corddry is an actor to lookout for cause he's excellent in almost every role he's in. He's a star to be! His voice is excellent. It adds flesh and tone to the character that is Gary.  All in All, I know that I said a lot of bad things about this movie, but most of it is miner and is over shadowed. This film may be best for little kid's, and was made more to attract money than to attract decent rating, but it's not the worst animated movie out there now a days.  C"
1285,2.0,"Basically it's about these idiot teenagers that some how are freaking clueless in the ways of the world and they have zero manners for being from the UK.  Which thinking about it, is kind of funny.  Now if it was a American movie, that would be kind of the norm."
1286,5.0,"A lot of accolades have already been written so this will be short. Obviously if you're a fan you'll love it. For me Frampton has always just been a so so FM staple guitar player. And while he may not be considered a virtuoso player his playing here is excellent. Great show. Guys enjoying themselves on stage and playing their hearts out. Direction is good for a concert video. Not too much cut and pan. Small intimate venues. Video quality is great. HD 5.1 audio is freaking EXCELLENT!

This is well worthy of any concert blu ray collection. And if you have a good system you're really going to want to crank it up...kick back and enjoy!"
1287,5.0,"In February of 1972, President Nixon's plane landed in China. I went to a middle of the night dinner party to celebrate. The little black & white TV was on the table with the food. I was the youngest at the table. Of all the friends, at the party, except sleeping children... I think I am the only surviver. I'll just say that it's me, and Henry Kissinger who live on. It was a very big event in my life. About 15 years later John Adams and Peter Sellars had developed the opera. There have been many performances all over the world. I listened to a recording. Last year the Metropolitan Opera broadcast Nixon in China with John Adams conducting. I loved the PBS High Definition broadcast. This blu-ray disc is that performance. A DVD copy is included with the blu-ray. Since 1987, I have been singing ""Smooo-oooth,"" and ""News, news, news."" Yes, everyone wonders.... I have never encountered another human who sings those hits, off stage. But, that is your loss dear friends.

I will describe this ""show"" for folks less excited than I am about the history, and the composer that I have loved for 25 years. The disc is excellent. I have come to love the Met just in the years since the HD broadcasts have been delivered to me by PBS. The disc image quality is perfect, slightly better than the broadcast. It helps to have the menu control so that I can show my favorite parts to friends. I will buy every blu-ray of a Met performance that is offered. I'm also in the middle of the Wagner Ring that just came out. (Fantastic).

What a way to deliver history. I intend to give my teen aged grandchildren the lesson. Oh, I spare them the... length by presenting a ""best of"" experience. I'll talk it up with my stories of the time. You may not realize it, but Nixon's trip to China was one of the most important events in history. I detested Nixon mind you and I think Henry Kissenger is a war criminal. But, Nixon changed the world. His wife was the gentle and warm woman who seems to have kept Nixon from going off the deep end... much like Nancy Reagan. ""First Ladies"" are so freaking important. I'm cheering for a certain former first lady to be our next president. Sorry... but it really is magnificent to have a huge work of art like Nixon in China be so much a part of modern life. The opera will help you understand what a great thing the China revolution was. ""The people are the Heroes now."" The People's Republic of China has been the biggest movement of the most people in the history of the world. The opera gives us some of that feeling. Our leaders, be they American, or Chinese, Russian or British... are always flawed. Every character in this story has problems... even the heroes, the people.

Henry Kissinger is comic and not heroic. Nixon is truly brilliant, yet full of the issues we all know something about. Mao is over-the-top with regard for his own brilliance... which seems to be fading fast. Mao's wife is witch-like but nevertheless conscious of the magnificent journey of the people into the future. Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China was a real life grand opera before Peter Sellars and John Adams came a long.

The choreography is by Mark Morris. He's perfect for this. Wow. It is such a major component of the show. It is exactly what it should be. I think that I will view this many times. I love every moment. Thomas Hampson is the host... great interviews and insight. The singing is so satisfying. All of these people are great.

The stage art is beautiful and fun. I am nuts about this show. There are tragic reminders of the 1960's and 1970s. We think about Nixon's Vietnam and the protests. Yet we weep for his ability to see what an American president can do for humanity. Nixon cleared a path for China's hero people.

I would love to see Adams and Sellars work on an opera about 2012. There is so much right here in our faces this month. Well, I'm thinking of a working title of ""The people are the heroes now."" Maybe ""Clinton in Palestine,"" or ""Obama in Ohio,"" or ""Romney in Utah,"" ""Fox in the Newsroom,"" ""Peace in the the desert... a dream,"" yeah, that's it."
1288,5.0,"Brilliantly, freaking hilarious for every moment of every episode!"
1289,4.0,It takes a bit but grows on you. JLD is a freaking scream. I hope the next few seasons are funnier tho'.
1290,2.0,"This is a show with a very good cast and some really weak writers; a lot of the jokes border on some old material from the Larry David show ""reworked"" for a ""political"" show.  A real shame because this show does have it's moments where it is funny.  IMHO too many ""tall"" jokes regarding ""Jonah"" but the character ""Dan Egan"" seems to have some nicely writen material playing a Machevelian staffer.

My main critical comment regards a lot of HBO content; too much profanity!  Now, I am retired from the military so ""frank language"" is still a bad habit I am trying to break.  In show business however HBO makes a critical mistake with hit shows not looking four or five seasons down the road.  Example, the ""Soprano's"" and ""Deadwood"" were just great shows and people who didn't care for the language could vote with the remote.  However, the ""Boston"" version of the Soprano's is a little silly with all the ""freaking"" and other sorry measures made to clean it up enough for cable.  As to Deadwood, if a ""Boston"" version was ever cut for syndication the show would go from an hour to maybe a three minute show the profanity was so bad.  For those of you who are younger, the ""Boston"" version was a term that came from burlesque meaning that while in Boston you had to clean up the act to prevent a raid.

Returning to HBO, they would do well to bring in some writers who don't have to go for the crouch to get laughs.  This could be a very funny show.  They need to clean up the language.  I am a big fan of the A&E franchise ""Breaking Bad""; this is a show about drug traficing, killing and manufacturing meth and with the brilliant writers Vince Gilligan, Executive Producer brings to the script they won't have to produce a ""Boston"" version.  With the dark subject matter coupled with the gallows humor this show exhibits they won't have to clean it up for cable.  HBO will come to the realization that great writers can create quality drama and comedy and stay out of the gutter."
1291,1.0,"What the hell is wrong with Rob Zombie? I get that the guy grew up on Heavy Metal and old black & white Horror movies, but there is twisted and then there is insane. The things that must be going through this mans head, that encouraged him to write something like this, is the true definition of horrific. The film follows a radio DJ in Salem, Massachusetts, who has been seeing some strange things. One day a weird record shows up at the station and the DJ plays it on the air. The seemingly innocent record becomes the most requested song on the station, but not without consequences, as it posses the local female population. I am a fan of his music, so I know how strange and twisted Rob Zombie can be, but even I have my limits. Following one of the best horror films I've ever seen, The Devil's Rejects, I was really looking forward to Zombie's next project. That film was a good story, with strong characters, and an amazing ending. This film is pure garbage, meant to shock and disturb audiences, and it does a very good job of that. From nude elderly women, spitting blood on babies, and opening gateways to hell to scary psychics and beast like creatures running around in the dark, this movie is full of things you just never want to see. Rob's wife, Sheri Moon Zombie stars and the once beautiful, up and coming star of the Devil's Rejects, is now covered in tattoos and looks like she hasn't eaten in months. Her performance is flat and unbelievable, adding to the mountain of manure that this film is offering. I love Horror movies and I love weird stuff, but this was just above and beyond freaking weird. I should have turned the film off when nude witches were spitting blood on babies, but I didn't, I stuck with it and I'm sorry I did. I don't know if I'll ever be able to get some of the horrific images out of my head."
1292,5.0,This is so freaking worth every single cent you spend! Do not hesitate to buy this but it now! :-)
1293,5.0,"I think this is my second favorite Resident Evil movie of the franchise. People are always going to complain about the character of Alice because she is not to be found in any of the games and was an original character created by the director of the Resident Evil franchise film series. But as much as people complain about this, these movies are still doing okay box office wise. So even though people don't like to freely admit it, they seem to actually like the character of Alice.

With that being said, this would be my favorite of the series as far as a completely original story goes. Its actually highly entertaining, it has amazing visuals and great sound. It brings in a few more new characters from the Resident Evil games that they have not put in any of the other movies before which was cool, and they brought back Wesker which is probably my favorite character from the actual games.

I would say that Resident Evil: Apocalypse is still my favorite Resident Evil movie so far because it is the one that resembles an actual Resident Evil game the most (Resident Evil 3: Nemesis). But, I wouldn't put Resident Evil Retribution very far behind it at all because it is so highly entertaining. It might possibly be even better because of the 3D.

As far as the 3D goes this has got to be one of the BEST 3D movies I've ever seen. A lot of people seem to say that the 3D in Resident Evil Afterlife was better but I have to disagree. I think this movie had more pop-out shots as well as CONSTANT DEPTH. It looked so freaking amazing. It would have to be one of my top 5 3D movies to date. Had this movie not had the amazing 3D I probably would only give this movie 3 or 4 stars but I really wasn't expecting the 3D to be this good. This movie is worth the purchase just for the 3D alone."
1294,3.0,maggie gyllenhaal makes this unwatchable. Her voice is so irritating. The President of the United States is trapped in the White House with terrorists and she whispers through out the entire freaking movie.  No one in that situation would be that calm and whisper like they are in church.
1295,1.0,"A real story or not, this story is more meant to be a dark comedy than an actual drama, because the two main characters are borderline mentally disabled. So let's summarize the depth of the movie in its entirety here:

""An unbelievably dumb and naive pair of women listen to someone who simply claims to be a police officer. Over the phone. Yes, over the phone. They believe every word he says and do everything he says, no matter how blatantly outrageous and in every way would never even be close to reasonable for anyone, because hey, he says he's a cop. Which makes absolutely no sense to anyone.""

Seriously, the plot ends right where it begins. A police officer explains something over the phone and that he needs her ""help"". He feeds her enough BS ""Call me officer!"" and ""Don't tell anyone!"" that's fit more for a Crank Yankers routine than a freaking drama.

Pro tip for common sense: Cops don't call over the phone asking a civilian to do a single thing he asks. He isn't present, and thus can't prove he's a cop. He also isn't present for something this allegedly ""major"" trouble Rebecca is in. So, uh, the guy's apparently a good prank caller, and these two women never, at any point in the entire ordeal, ask the obvious question, ""Can you prove this isn't a prank call?"" This has never been done before in the history of anything, ever. Everything this ""officer"" claims is totally unprovable and wildly not-cop-like.

Not that any of that matters at all. The second the caller says he's an officer is when the conversation would end. That's it. That's the end of the tension. The police don't operate by proxy, because they're apparently too busy to deal with this ""serious situation"" with even one police officer. It makes absolutely no difference what he says. He can say whatever he wants. But unless he's there, *NO ONE* is obligated to a single thing until he shows up.

So, hey, if you're dumb enough to fall for one of the oldest prank calls ever done by anyone (Do you think this is the first time someone's pranked someone by claiming to be an officer and asking for equally astonishingly outrageous things?), you deserve to go through all this, because you'd need to be naive and ignorant on a level so supernatural to not even think that NONE OF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.

You don't need to be an expert on the police, or even have experience with the police, to have the thought, ""Hey, is there some reason no one's come here themselves to question her, and the 'backup'--apparently because you can't be too careful when raiding a fast-food joint for a freaking teenage girl on the job who is the least threatening person, ever, of all time--didn't just come here first?""

It's not like she had any intentions of fleeing the country. The ""officer"" claims to have surveillance footage of some sort perfectly describing Rebecca. Rebecca obviously has no intention of leaving whatsoever.

Whether or not this was based on a true story and how accurate it is, this is a freaking comedy posing as a serious drama. Every character here is stupid. I know movie characters are often stupid, but this doesn't just cross the line of total ignorance, it's obviously absurd. No one, not one person, not even Kevin--the single character who initially appears to have a working brain--questions the incredible and stunningly obvious absurdity of the situation.

This is a movie that, like cheap horror flicks, relies on incredibly stupid characters who can't even think as far ahead as to realize anyone can say they're an officer. Every single person buys it. Everyone, 100%, no questions asked. When even someone with the intelligence of a teenager might think to ask, ""How do you know this guy's a cop by talking over the phone? And do you seriously think anyone's been asked to do any of this in the history of 'police procedure'?"" How far gone do you have to be to not even *question* this?

Maybe if they even had a single scene of someone questioning this guy, that *might* make it a little more acceptable. But there is no bump in the transition of ""I'm an officer, fetch the one who's an alleged thief. Be sure to tell everyone about it who isn't involved in the slightest, nor are they required to be involved at any point (guess what, the police do their own work!), and I'm officer Daniels, that's all you will know about me, you can hand the phone to anyone because I realize everyone's this insane, you can do strip searches over the FREAKING PHONE, and my only problem is that I can't get any officers there to actually do anything, so why don't you do these things that you aren't even allowed to do, even if an 'officer' tells you to do it?""

Unbelievable. But not unbelievable in the entertaining way, just in the, ""You can't be serious. This is the plot? That's it? This is how it starts and continues on as more and more people get involved, and I get much more hostile and threatening than any officer would *EVER* be?""

I'll tell you what happens when I get a call about something this ridiculous, and believe me, it's relatively common for almost any place. If it's profit-oriented (such as, ""Our network says your computer's infected. Here's what you need to do...OR ELSE."" it's typically aimed toward senior citizens, and not someone like me, who works (not to their knowledge) in medical data security. I take the call, act involved, and try to trace the source (and not with movie equipment that takes 30 seconds flat, just a little something called caller ID that, um, works instantaneously when the call arrives. Sometimes these schemes are so short-sighted, they don't even bother with a private number), and then report it to the police. That's how it works.

I can't say I've ever been called by someone claiming to be an officer. But I really don't think I need to, since I've been called by people who aren't who they claim to be all the time. But I know one thing, and one thing that seems obvious: The police doesn't phone in their arrests. In fact, if anything, a real officer would tell you to stay the hell out of it if they aren't present, and simply wait until they arrive. You, yourself, are *their* problem, not the other way around, short of being the victim in an armed home invasion, in which case they tell you, if possible, to hide, or if that's not possible, to do every single thing the other party tells you. Because that's how it's always worked in the history of everything. If someone calls claiming to be an officer, guess what? You tell the real police about it. That's common sense. I like to think most people have it to some reasonable extent.

But uh, sorry, cops don't do arrests--much less convictions--over the freaking phone. Get the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew, this film goes up there as ""one of the worst films ever made"", without question. It has no right to be taken seriously by anyone, and the very presumption that it should is insulting. Total trash.

I'm glad I watched this for free on Prime, because the plot interested me. Unfortunately, it was written totally incompetently, and directed even worse. An atrocious abomination of filmmaking that is begging its audience to turn it off the entire time."
1296,2.0,"I think this series is the main cause of why my blood pressure is escalating whenever I pay attention to it. I was never fond of Police/Investigation/Crime shows except for a few here and there. My friend insisted this was a good show to watch and don't get me wrong for the first 5 or so episodes it was thrilling and engaging but it doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that the plots just keep dragging on and on and are quite repetitive. In short the fault doesn't lie with the actors but with the plot itself, it's ridiculous even for a TV show.

Joe Carrol a former college professor, is well the villain the title ""The Following"" is based on his ability to reach out for those unloved/unwanted/outcast civilians who also suffer from a disease called psychopathy or otherwise known in today's pop culture Psycho. He more or less uses these people to form an organization that's going to follow his lead of serial murders, kidnappings, torture and all the inhuman activities ever invented to help him write the greatest novel alive which will be based on the real life of these murders. Not Only that he also chooses Ryan Hardy the former FBI agent who had an affair with Joe Carrol's ex wife and was the reason behind his capture a couple of years ago to be the patroness of this great work of literature that he's preparing. But that's not the point. The Point is the bad people are all intellects, sophisticated, dominating, sneaky and have a good strategy. While the good guys on the other hand, are hopeless and by hopeless I mean they can't do anything to save their lives and as a ramification of that the bad guys keep winning over and over while the good once lose everything.

I just got bored, the endless killings of civilians in the name of this literally work while no one's able to catch them in the act is a tad unbelievable. The ability of Joe Carrol to brain wash as many people to join him in his little killing spree is just unrealistic and strange especially when we come to realize he was doing it while he was behind bars through the internet? Seriously! Come Join me in my quest of criminal activties and you'll get a chapter in my upcoming book! Yeah, no one will buy that!

The minions are pathetic, losers who killed their (-------) and ran away with it cause the authorities are so dumb to catch them especially when they're already suspects entering a freaking Jail to visit a death row criminal who's responsible for the killing of 14 young girls. Did You get that? He's a mass murder and still gets unlimited jail visit times to interview his minions.

Just, don't let me go any further I could go on and on and on about how stupid and impossible this situation would be in real life but I don't think my ramblings will end.

Not to mention, he escapes prison again! and his followers fly him through a helicopter don't ask me how they afforded it unless they killed it's passengers to a huge mansion where he'll be crowned as their King. If this was happening in some medieval legend I might have bought that but in the real world in modern times with all this technology?

I don't really know what the writers of this show are trying to portray by doing all of this? Is it for the sake of entertainment alone? Cause if it is let me tell you it's quite repetitive. Unless the writers have this hate for the FBI and just want to portray them as useless then fine. Whatever!

I don't think I'll be watching the following season. What a waste of great potential!"
1297,5.0,"Can we talk?!  How is it that she just had her seventy eighth birthday and has more energy by far than any twenty year old I have ever encountered.  Either she is high shooting speed or running on energized batteries.  Firstly, she is funny as freaking hell and secondly her comedic timing and the way in which she has so much absolute fun on stage is inspiring beyond words.  And it is also under the extenuating circumstances, incredibly sad.  Eighty one is just a number and for someone else they maybe will even be elderly.  Joan has said to Melissa when she dies nobody will say ""so young"".  In her case though I do say just that.  Young and vibrant, hysterically funny and full of life.  I hugely recommend this video to anyone who is not easily offended because there are no holds barred and that is why we love her!!

1298,5.0,"OMG I just finished watching this from Amazon rental freaking awesome way scarrier than expected, two outstanding actors give top not performances ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan-John Winchester father of Dean, and Sam winchester on the TV show Supernatural ) plays the dad ( Kira Sedgewick-of The Closer ) plays the mom. After a divorce the dad gets his own house while driving past some houses his youngest daughter ( Emily ) spots a garage sale his daughter reminds him that he needs dishes, they stop and while looking at things ( Emily ) see's an old wooden box with words carved into it. Later on strange things begin happening. After a visit to a professor for a translation then a rabi they learn that the box is actually a prison/vessel to keep a powerful and ancient female demon locked inside, in Jewish language she is named taker of children, a young rabi performs an exorcism and all hell breaks loose

The movie is a mix of drama family love and horror it feels very realistic, the actors give excellent performances and play their parts very convincingly. The plot, and scenes are amazing very well done and the overall quality is great definately 5 stars. You can tell that the writers and directors took their time with and put a lot into it"
1299,3.0,"What I respect about this film is that they tell it knowing that their viewers (most of them at least) know the story, and thus they don't try to slowly build up the mysterious reveal of Carrie's powers.  You get to see examples of them right away, and you get to see more of her mom's earlier life to help support the ""crazy"".  I respect that while Carrie is very timid as her character is meant to be - a result of an overbearing and religious zealot of a mother - she breaks out of her naivete.  One thing viewers hate is when their protagonist doesn't ask the logical questions, but you get to see Carrie doing a bit of that when she second-guesses the intentions of people around her, when she tells her mom how something she said is terrible.  You get to see Carrie exploring her powers and relishing in them, and the director isn't trying to tease you with a slow reveal of them as if you have no idea what could possibly be happening.

The problem with the movie are its extreme caricatures and some overly dramatic scenes like the initial bathroom scene, the miss-drama-queen training session where coach suspends the antagonist. I dunno... I know their purpose is to make it clear that Carrie has justifications for freaking out at the end and the mean kids really get what's coming to them, but IMO a director who can delicately straddle the line between drama and melodrama is what makes a horror movie go from ""Meh, Okay"" to ""Awesome"", and that line is probably the hardest to walk in a gory horror movie.

Chloe Grace Moritz sheds a lot of the painful timidity and utter naivete of Sissy Spacek's potrayal, but there are parts in the end when she's just doing this overly maniacal heaving thing when she wields her powers.  Chloe/Carrie can't decide if she's going to be plain old dumbly naive or more bold and assertive. In one scene she's looking around the room with this scared pout on her face like she's not even sure how she got there, and in the next she's just a normal teenager and the next as a blood-thirsty super villian.

Directing, acting, I dunno, but it just misses the mark.

So, in conclusion: this movie had a lot of potential and succeeded at being a fresh exploration of an old story with respect to addressing a few things the viewer might otherwise criticize seeing as how we love to be cynics, but it falls a bit flat in the execution and I think I can mostly blame that on a lot of the over-acting and some odd directing choices.  It just can't seem to find the sweet spot.

Anyways, it's worth the watch but it doesn't stand out as anything special."
1300,5.0,"So after having been one of Stephen King's best novels, been made into a hugely successful 1976 movie, which spawned a pretty decent and rather under-rated sequel in early 2000s The Rage: Carrie II; then having been remade into an outstanding and hugely under-rated 2002 two-part tv movie, was there really anywhere left to go with the Carrie concept?  At one point I would have said no, if there's going to be another King movie let it be from one of his novels or stories that hasn't been adapted yet.  But the promos for the latest incarnation of Carrie looked good, and anyway I'll give just about any horror movie a chance.  It leads to some duds but it also leads to movies that you never would have expected to be as good as they are.  So while my expectations for the 2013 Carrie were not rock bottom, they initially weren't sky high though.  When I actually saw it I was blown away.

In my opinion this may just be the best of all the  versions, and that's saying a lot.  It doesn't totally re-invent the story from new angles, but everything it does it does so freaking well that I wouldn't change a thing.  And the ways in which it is different, while subtle, are significant.

The basic story is by now pretty universally known.  Carrie White, secretly a telekinetic, lives a hellish life tormented at school by boorish classmates and at home by a fanatical mother.  At the year's big prom, she's finally pushed too far, with catastrophic results.  Many of the differences involve Carrie's antagonists.  In this one, the whole angle with the kids at school is more that there's a small number of true scumbags, but most of the rest involved with her torment kind of just got caught up with the ringleaders's egging on, and as soon as it's done with and anybody has a chance to actually use a braincell, are left thinking ""Oh crap, that really was pretty rotten"" and feel bad about it.  The character of Sue Snell feels better developed and more genuine this time around.  In previous tellings of the story it didn't quite feel authentic how after the incident is over, Sue turns around and becomes Carrie's champion, even arranging for her boyfriend to ask Carrie to the prom as part of her drive to make up for her earlier actions, and to try and get social outcast Carrie involved in things.  However, even with most (certainly not all) of the other students seeming not as evil this time around, you can still see perfectly how Carrie is so scared, so mixed up with repression and guilt derived from her mother's fanaticism where EVERYTHING is a sin, and so traumatized by her twin desires to just be left alone on one hand and wanting to fit in and actually have friends on the other hand, how the situation looks to her.  She really does feel alone and thinks pretty much everybody hates her, and after Sue has nudged Carrie along with some of the other kids, it gets to the to the point where she suddenly feels ""Oh wow, I'm NOT alone, some of the others even Like me"".  And when the pivotal Incident happens at the prom you see why she thinks it was all a cruel plot all along with everybody involved, not just a few who decide to take her torments to a new level that night, and that shatters her psyche much more after it had started to heal than if she'd never developed a hope that things were changing for her.

Carrie herself is depicted as a gentle, highly intelligent person underneath the scars of her mental instability and ill treatment.  Chloe Grace Moretz's potrayal of the character is one of several award-worthy performances in the film, and you see a whole array of different emotional states in Carrie - sometimes very innocent and even highly childlike, sometimes very very lonely and terrified of everything (including herself), sometimes with a dawning confidence that shows how she may have been without so much emotional trauma, and after she finally is pushed too far, just - just Totally shattering on so many levels and losing control.  The movie is an epic tragedy as well as a killer horror movie, and even Carrie's mother, despite how warped she is, is this time around a character we pity more than hate.  I've already said more about what goes on in the latter portions of the movie than I usually do in a writeup (I felt it wasn't really spoilers since you see so much of those parts just in the trailer) so I think I'm going to wrap up now.  Bottom line - this is a must-see for horror fans, and if you've been avoiding this one because it's ""already been done"" you should really give it a chance anyway.  This is a remake that justifies its existance through sheer excellence."
1301,5.0,This movie is a must buy for bat fans and joker fans because u finally get to see joker kill some people and it freaking epic so u should buy this movie ok bye
1302,5.0,"I don't care that the sound is flat, the black and white cinematography is flatter..and that all the back up dudes are clones of Richard: same height, same body frame, same suit, same freaking haircut...I am not kidding.

But to cut to the proverbial chase: here we have great A & R and that under-appreciated and under-discussed genius, Karen Carpenter. She and her Brother managed to inject light jazz into pop and create Top 100 and Small Club  appeal. An *original* talent who proves you can be a sex symbol in a dress found in the wardrobe department for the pilot of Little House on the Prairie; or whatever she wears on these early '70s TV performances.

A pleasure as nostalgia...and to value against the electro.-mechanical drivel with which we get blasted, today.

Just think of KC's ""so many roads to choose"" and get the chills all over again. Better yet, dig it on this cool DVD!"
1303,5.0,"I love this set. Seriously this is a must have for anyone who likes the movies. I am not a die hard fan of Twilight but I really did enjoy the movies. This set is freaking amazing. It is like in book form and all the dvds are inside. It's oddly satisfying how perfect it looks. I am glad I bought this set and not the individual movies. If you are a hardcore fan and already own the individual movies, I recommend buying this set anyway. You won't be disappointed."
1304,5.0,"It's a good, fun movie. The CGI is freaking amazing. I've seen this movie more times than I care to admit. I'd like to think my brother and I could run a Jaeger, if I wasn't such a fat piece of crap.
I have already seen a lot of movies from this director (maybe all of them, including one in Spanish), and I look forward to seeing more!"
1305,4.0,"Pacific Rim is not a perfect film, and there are some very good criticisms that can be made about it. However, in terms of the type of film that it is, and what it is actually trying to accomplish--from my perspective, anyway--it's a very enjoyable, impressive creation. Basically, if you are in the core target demographic, you will probably at least like if not love it. But if the 'giant robots fighting aliens' angle is not something that you particularly care about in and of itself, then this film is probably bound to be disappointing. Fair enough.

Strengths:
The money sequences, the ones in which the giant robots (Jaegers) are fighting the giant aliens (Kaiju) are absolutely fantastic. I could not be happier about that part of this film, and that is what this film is all about, so it goes a long way. Some have commented about the battles taking place offshore and at night. Does it help the visual effects to have darkness and water in the mix? Sure, but I also think that it looks freaking awesome. The choreography captures a great sense of scale, and the atmosphere is great.

The visual design is also much to my liking. I spent hours as a child drawing spaceships and the like, and I love the different designs of the Jaegers. It's a bit like technology porn. Also, as someone who has lived in Alaska, I found that the sets and buildings really do capture the feel of ""northern Pacific industrial"" architecture, which gives Pacific Rim a rather unique feel for a blockbuster.

Weaknesses
There are two things, here. First, the human characters are hit and miss. While Idris Elba is great as always and Rinko Kikuchi's flashback sequence is possibly the best scene in the film, Charlie Hunam is very wooden as a lead, and most of the other ""pilots"" are either underdeveloped or thinly cliched. Second, there are at least two or three plot elements that are extremely overt rip-offs of Independence Day. As in, practically cut-and-paste. It would probably have been better to avoid such blatant copying of another film.

I was also a bit surprised at the amount of humor (Charlie Day, Ron Perlman) in this film. At first, it felt like it was taking away from the seriousness, but from where I stand now, I appreciate it. This film is designed to be entertaining, and it can be taken as a bit of a blessing that the tone is not monotonous. It's actually a lot of fun.

Finally, a comparison with the Transformers films is both fair and unavoidable, because giant robots. While Pacific Rim is not the best-written film, it is quite a breath of fresh air for one who finds Michael Bay's style to be often obnoxious and immature. Pacific Rim also, arguably does a better job of capturing the visceral quality of giant robots in battle. This film is all about that very thing in a way that the Transformers films have not quite been, and that is why Pacific Rim gets my approval in spite of its imperfections."
1306,5.0,"I. Love. This. Movie. I could watch it every freaking day if I could. Now, I will admit, that the commercials make it seem super, super cheesy. However, after going to the cheap theaters to watch it? I regret not seeing it when it came out! Definitely on my top 3 in movies!"
1307,1.0,"i first seen this trailer back earlier this year when it was released and i was like ha a freaking transformers wanna be in the ocean. then i got a girlfriend and we both fell in love with watching movies a lot, mainly the so called blockbuster like movies. so i actually skipped this movie because i thought the guy from iron man 2/3  that wore the blue ironman suit whatever his name was was the main character in this movie lol but no so I started watching it 30 mins in the movie i'm like ummmmmm when is he going to show up? my GF is like he's not in this movie so I'm like oh i could of sworn in the trailers that was him. So I was like well maybe this will be a good movie than.......WRONG! freaking the movie failed to give you the blockbuster fights you wanted to see, instead you get idiots go out in the water with they plastic suits and get torn to part one by one. Like you mean to tell me no one has a suit that can deliver the goods to these fruity monsters. Then the whole 2 people bringing their brains together to control the gaint robots? really that concept is stupid. I can't stress on how the plot is boring and the fights are let down. Sure the monsters where tough but far as the guys in the suits controlling the robots NO.  a 1 out of 5"
1308,5.0,best freaking movie of the year. hands down. no arguements. get it. watch it. love it. and watch it again. or idris elba will yell louder.
1309,3.0,"Well it's here everyone, my second most anticipated movie of the summer behind the exceptional World War Z. What could possibly be better than a worldwide zombie outbreak starring Brad Pit? How about a summer blockbuster about giant monsters and robots smashing the hell out of each other? It's like someone watched a bunch of anime and decided that, hell yeah, mechs VS monsters is a freaking great idea for a movie and American audiences will eat it up. I mean, how can you screw that up? Monsters, robots, in an anime inspired brawl to the death? Shut up and take my money! But as amazing as that sounds, Pacific Rim, though fun and most certainly enjoyable at times, doesn't quite manage to live up to expectations.

In 2012 a riff opened up at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean through which monsters of enormous size called Kuaji entered the earth and wreaked havoc on our major cities. First San Francisco was destroyed. Six months later, Manila. As time went on more and more Kuaji emerge from the riff to wreak havoc on our shores. In response to this threat humanities governments rallied together to create the Juager program (perhaps after taking too many Juager Bombs) and begin construction on a series of giant robots to battle the Kuaji. And for a while it works. More and more monsters come out of the riff with less time between attacks, and every time they are destroyed by the Juagers. But things have changed. The Kuaji are coming more and more frequently, and the Juagers are being overwhelmed. Twelve years after the initial breach humanity has placed all its hope in a gigantic sea wall around all its shores (which is exactly as stupid an idea as it sounds) and given up on the Juagers. With only four Juagers left operational, and extinction knocking on humanities doorstep, a last ditch effort is made to close the breach once and for all and end the Kuaji threat for good.

What follows is a disjointed, cheesy, fun as hell mess of a film that at the same time is one of the corniest films of the year and one of the most entertaining. Let me get the negatives out of the way now, and please hold off on the crucifixion if you can. The movie spends way too much time focusing primarily on the characters in the film, which would be great had there not been such terrible character development. Okay, that's a bit harsh. They aren't THAT terrible, but with so much time and effort given to them when we could have been watching a giant monster bash the very least Del Torro could have given us was compelling characters and convincing acting. A character driven story of the world's desperate fight against unstoppable odds is not a bad idea, in fact it was done quite well when it was called Neon Genesis Evangelion (for those of you who don't know, it's an anime mech series that has achieved legendary status), but Pacific Rim doesn't even do a passable job in developing its characters into people we'll care about. We do get a couple of touching moments, esp when it comes to female lead Mako Mori (played by Rinko Kikuchi) but all that is done in flashback and very little is done with her adult self. All the other characters are cheap one dimensional cardboard cutouts with no depth, little personality, and nothing at all compelling about them.

""But it's a monster VS robot movie!"" you say. ""Why would you go see this film if you wanted three dimensional characters?"" Well, you have a point.  I didn't go to the movie to see a character driven film. And that's the problem. Pacific Rim tries to be more than that and does focus on its characters a lot more than other movies of this type. It TRIES to be more then Star Trek, or Iron Man, or any of the other mindless summer fare we've seen this year. It just fails at it, and fails badly. EVA this is not. The script is full of pointless tension, cheesy one liners, and wasted characters. It really needed to go through another draft or two before they started filming.

Okay, now that I've got that out of my system, let's get on to what the film did right. For a film like this they really only had to do one thing right and one thing only, and that's the fights. And yes, I'm glad to announce that what fights they did have were actually quite good. Though I do have quibbles with how the monsters were designed, that was quickly forgotten the first time a Juager punched a Kuaji in the face. Such scenes of epic awesomeness are just too much for the human brain to comprehend. The robots are amazing, reflecting their countries of origin in both design, functionality, and tactics. Whereas the Russian Juager is built like a tank and fights in similar fashion, the Chinese Juager is a lot sleeker and uses its speed and many bladed weapons to their advantage. The tech is also interesting as well as the Juagers require two pilots to operate as it would kill a lone pilot. It may seem like a stretch to give a movie three stars for fight scenes alone, but come on. It's a giant monster movie. THIS is what people are paying for, so this is clearly the most important aspect of the film. And Pacific Rim blows it out of the water. I'll call it right now; Pacific Rim is the best live action American movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters. Hands down.

So is Pacific Rim worth seeing? If you want to see robots battle monsters in one of the most epic battle royals of the year, then yes. If not, nooooo. It's a fun movie, with a good deal of action to keep people entertained for a long time. Though the silliness, the bad character development, and the cheesy script hold this film back it does the battles right and that's all people really wanted from this film anyway. Is it a masterpiece? No, not even close. Is it a fun romp of a film with fun battles and amazing effects? Hells yeah it is.

Replay value, high."
1310,1.0,"I can count on one hand the number of good remakes I have seen in my lifetime. The Thing, The Fly, and Terrence Malick's Thin Red Line are all examples of remakes that trumped the original films. Last year's rehash of Red Dawn is likely to go down in the record books as the worst remake in cinematic history.

Growing up in the '80s, I have a soft spot in my heart for the original Red Dawn (1984). As implausible an idea of a joint Soviet/Cuban invasion was, somehow John Milius not only made the premise work, but injected a frightful sense of stark realism into his story. Red Dawn (1984) was a very atmospheric film, and a subtle character study of two reluctant leaders, Col. Bella (Ron O'Neal) and Jed Eckert (Patrick Swayze). Watching a group of scared high school kids develop into hardened partisans seemed natural and logical. And their eventual dissolution was heartbreaking. I can watch the 1984 Red Dawn over and over and it never loses its punch, despite its flaws.

The remake is devoid of any redeeming qualities whatsoever. I will attempt to break down the most glaring problems with this film as I see them.

Chris Hemsworth as Jed Eckert: Hemsworth might as well have been playing Thor again. He never made any leadership mistakes; he demonstrated no crisis of conscience; he could make the ""Wolverines"" fall in line at the drop of a hat with a glare and some silly, ham-fisted dialogue. The original Jed was just an average joe with some wilderness survival skills. Hemsworth's Jed was a battle-tested Marine, so he was a warrior right off the bat.

I can't really blame the actor for a bad screenplay, but the 2012 Jed Eckert never had to level a gun at a comrade turned traitor; never made the mistake of falling into a well-laid enemy trap; never held a childhood photo and cried to himself at the innocence and camaraderie he lost. No, Hemsworth never faced anything resembling a challenge. And for that, his portrayal of Jed Eckert failed miserably. Patrick Swayze's Jed was a very flawed leader whose decisions were sometimes terribly wrong and, one could argue, led to the deaths of his friends and his own brother. That made his character all the more real. In contrast, Hemsworth's Jed didn't really face any trial he wasn't already trained to handle.

Matt Eckert: Whoever played this character turned in the most wooden performance of the movie. He was completely unconvincing as Jed's brother. His rallying speech at the end was a complete joke. I'd have rather watched a drunken, middle-aged Charlie Sheen reprise this role than the kid they cast as Jed's younger brother.

Robert: In the '84 version, C. Thomas Howell's Robert was my favorite character. He progressively became the most rabid Wolverine of the lot, and went out fighting against all odds. His death underscored the futility of partisan warfare. I was wondering when Robert was going to turn into the hardened killer in this version. Unfortunately, I found the Robert of this film to be an afterthought. A complete cypher.

The Enemy: North Korea? Are you kidding me? It was a big enough leap to think that the Soviets could end up on US soil in '84...but North Korea in 2012? That stretches things into the realm of impossibility, even though they're supposed to be a part of some ""Asian Communist coalition."" The enemy in this film posed no threat at all to the Wolverines, yet still managed to take over the Pacific Northwest. Their commander, Capt. Cho, was a one-dimensional cardboard cutout -- a far cry from O'Neal's Bella in the '84 version (or William Smith's Strelnikov, for that matter).

Andy Tanner: Recasting Powers Boothe's original grounded ""Eagle Driver"" was another major let-down. They should have just left Tanner out of the film. No depth of character was displayed -- Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Tanner, recast as a Marine, was all action and ""oo-rah!"" 2012's Andy Tanner was as pointless and wooden as Capt. Cho. You would think that Tanner and his motivated teammates could have shown a little humility about their battle readiness -- after all, in this film, we'd just gotten whipped by a country that can't even feed its own people.

The Dialogue: Forced. We get an unhealthy dose of simpleton patriotism to explain why the Wolverines are fighting; why they ""need to stay and fight""; why they are going to fight, etc. It took several painful scenes of bad dialogue to convey their convictions and motives. When asked ""what makes us different from them?"" in the '84 version, Swayze's Jed summed it up in one sentence. ""Because we live here."" That simple answer was a thousand times more convincing than any bit of rah-rah jingoism vomited forth from anyone in the remake.

Erica and Toni: Why did the screenwriter bother with these two? In the '84 Red Dawn, Erica (Lea Thompson) and Toni (Jennifer Grey) were spirited and could slug it out with the other guys, no questions asked. In the remake, the pair never showed anything resembling grit, combat fatigue, or any emotion besides blank stares when they weren't fawning over the Eckert brothers.

Atmosphere: The atmosphere of 2012's Red Dawn was the equivalent of watching someone else play an urban-warfare first person shooter on the Xbox 360. An hour and 30-odd minutes of the ""Wolverines"" blowing things up and then returning to the safety of their ""underground base"" got real old, real fast. In the '84 version, battlefields looked like the real deal; you could feel the cold, miserable conditions the Wolverines were living in; you could tell they were hungry, tired, and breaking down. None of that was present here. It seemed like freedom was just a car ride away, rather than a near-impossible trek through enemy lines.

Also, Milius didn't waste time taking the viewer into the action in '84. In the original version, you see a few location shots of Calumet, Colorado to establish the identity of the town, then you're smack dab in the middle of a high school history class when paratroopers fall from the sky. There was no CGI back then, so this all looked and felt completely real. Here, you have a typical teen movie lead-up, where time is wasted on a freaking football game! Then, you get to suffer through at least 10 minutes of pointless character introductions -- pointless because the characters are never really developed in the movie at all. About 15 minutes in, the CGI invaders fall from the sky with absolutely no sense of menace at all. Yawn.

Score: Basically, there was none to speak of. Basil Poledouris' dynamic soundtrack from 1984 could have been easily worked into this film as a motif by the composer. Instead, the director and producers took the video game route: they opted for a soundtrack that was lifeless and dull, and blended innocuously into the background.

I could go on for days with a list of problems that made this retooling a complete farce, but I'll leave you with this: either save your money or just watch the original film. Either way, you won't be disappointed.

I can't say the same if you rent or buy the 2012 remake of Red Dawn.

Zero stars."
1311,1.0,"I have enjoyed all the Die Hard movies, understanding that they are over the top and ridiculous.  However, this movie was just awfully ridiculous.  The acting grade F. Its as if Bruce woke up hungover one day and got a call from a producer and this is what happened:
Producer- ""Bruce! Whats up...wanna make some money today?""
BRUCE - ""argh, sure, why not, will it take long?""
Producer - ""Naw, I have another Die Hard movie in the works, the name alone should draw millions, Ill write the plot before you get here...but I am thinking Russian spy stuff sounds good""
BRUCE - ""Sure, why not, I could use a new house in Malibu""

After Bruce gets to the studio he meets the horrible actors and the hot Russian Chick and says, ""Lets do this!""

So they shoot for one day and then Brucey goes home.  That's all he needed for this trash.  No retakes, or anything because most the action scenes are CGI and the acting so bad, its beyond Grade B movie.  The plot is silly and Bruce's son just seems to be thrown in there.

My friend and I kepy watching and hoping it would be worthy of something.  But the reality is, its awful. DONT waste your time on this movie.  It does not do any of the Die Hard movies justice and for God's sake if you do watching it, DONT WATCH IT on an LCD in HD or you will see just how freaking tired and old Bruce actually is."
1312,5.0,"So many people really crapped all over this movie and didn't like it, whatever, personally that just says that you are not a true Bruce Willis fan because this movie freaking ruled!!!!  It was just as awesome and great as the rest of the Die Hard films, John McClaine is such a freaking badass!!!!  Loved this flick from start to finish, A Good Day To Die Hard is an action packed, kick ass movie!!!!!"
1313,1.0,"Ok, there may be spoilers in this review.

I have been wanting this movie for a while.  I have the box set of the other movies.  So, I got this.  When I saw it was 90 some minutes.  I told my mom is was going to suck.  I am just going to tell you the bad stuff.  There was nothing good in my opinion.

Ok, while the movie was 90 some minutes, really, it was like 70.  The reason?  he beginning of the movie, there is what I can only guess is a twenty minute car chase.  It just goes on and on and on.  It may be kind of cool at first, but after like 10 minutes is just hits that dull phase.  We actually all started laughing.  You get to see cars flip and fly through the air.  Whatever, it was a waste of time.  This you will find is something that happens many times in the movie.  Your time gets wasted.

Now, the story.  I mean, there was none.  Something about someone stealing nuclear stuff from, ready, Chernobyl.  When I heard them say that I was like OH, MY, GOD.  So I guess these people want to steal nuclear stuff to make a weapon.  Alright, the place they want to get it from is so full of nuclear waste and so dangerous that even if you had the most advanced suit with protection, I do not think you would be able to survive even an hour there.  Yet, these terrorist just walk around.  THEN, and this made us all laugh, the father and son go in, fight and walk around with no protection on.  Just la, la, la, walking around a highly filled nuclear zone with no protection.  It was freaking ridiculous.  That is another thing you will see a lot in the movie.  The freaking father and son CAN NOT die.  I mean, they fall from a building, hit some stuff on the side and just survive.  Once, they are in a building and a helicopter is firing in shots from one of those guns.  I am not sure how many rounds a gun like that shoots off.  But let's just say they would be ripped in half.  But, nope.  They survive.  They have a slow motion scene and you see like 5 bullets coming in the building.  Really?  Five bullets.  Some on.  That entire building would be no more.  One scene, the father jumps from a helicopter, fly's through the air and goes in the side of a building.  Guess what?  He is fine.  I mean, they just make is so damn stupid.  These guys can not die.

Ok, the father and son have something going on.  The son does not like the father because the father worked to much when the kid was young.  Really?  They try to make their scenes funny and witty.  But I assure you, they are neither.  One scene the father is talking to someone about not being there for his son.  I mean, it is the WORST acting I have ever seen.  Like he is reading right from a piece of paper and putting nothing into it.  At the end, the freaking father and son are getting along great.  Again, really?  The father interrupts a mission the son is on.  I guess the father thinks it is fine to just get into a vehicle and start killing people.  Even though he is not even in the U.S. any more.  They kind of ruined the original movies making the son hate the father.  It just makes the originals feel sad.

This movie had so many great actors.  But, the acting was some of the worst I have ever seen.  It was like a cheesy, 70s B movie.  One that you would see at a drive in while high. It really was one of the worst things I have ever seen.  The best part of the movie was the last 20 or 30 minutes.  I think it is because you start to see why some of the stuff is happening.  That or you know the freaking thing is about to end.

I almost feel like this movie was made as a joke.  They said ""hey lets make this movie and make it as stupid and as far from Die Hard as we can.""  I have no clue why they even slapped the Die Hard name onto this movie.  This just I don't know.  Not Die Hard at all.  I actually didn't feel like I had even seen Bruce W. in the movie.  That is how bad the acting was.  Just 90 some minutes of pointless, meaningless dribble.  I can not sell the movie.  Again, I have the others and want this to add into my set.  Plus, I paid like $24 and something for it.  I would only loose money.  Just a bad idea to get this movie all around."
1314,2.0,"I love the Die Hard movies except for Die Hard with a Vengeance. The action was pretty spectacular in this movie overall. BUT, the dialogue was freaking horrific. Skip Woods needs his arse kicked for writing such drivel. Granted, I don't expect Shakespeare but this was beyond the pale. I found myself cringing constantly. I love Bruce Willis and Jai Courtney. They made a great father/son team. I'm just sorry I bought this on blu-ray. Not worth it at all. Back to the drawing board, folks..."
1315,4.0,"The Conjuring is *still* freaking me out!  Any film that reminds me of the Amityville Horror is bound to win me over in a HUGE way.  What the Conjuring does remarkably well is allow time to develop not only a story, but atmosphere and horror.  These are crucial details when it comes to horror films.  You can't just throw a bunch of children and teenage daughters together (5 of them to be exact) with a mom/dad and assume we'll all instantly attach/care about them.  You have to allow these characters to develop an identity which is what makes the Conjuring one of the better horror movies out there.  Certainly one of the best released in recent years.  Every one of the family members is given time to shine.

Actually what this movie does that the Amityville Horror does not (at least the original) is include moments of mystery in the storytelling.  It's not always 100% horror and scares.  Eventually the tone shifts in another direction which, in my opinion, is comparable to a mystery film.  With that said, the movie is most certainly a horror movie. The tone just sometimes goes in another direction perhaps unintentionally so to give viewers time to catch their breath.

Anyway the scares begin on a subtle and somewhat harmless note- the family experiences the occasional creeps of closet doors opening and crawling sounds/noises throughout the house, but soon other more serious things begin to happen.  Pictures slam off the walls, birds crash through the windows, visions of a hanging take place outside by a tree branch, bed sheets fly off the clothesline and form a human figure before oddly landing flat against the upstairs window playing with our imaginations since we're not entirely sure a thunderstorm is causing this to happen (one of my personal favorite moments), a young daughter wakes up crying because she believes someone is standing by her bedroom doorway which causes her sister to wake up and question her (second favorite moment) and well, the list goes on and on.

No, the Conjuring isn't as scary as the Amityville Horror.  It comes close on a few occasions, however.  It's absolutely delightful to watch and hear this movie on a DVD player with powerful speakers too.  Yes the film relies heavily on jump scares, but it also includes a remarkable amount of suspense and atmosphere.  The only reason I'm not giving the movie 5 stars is for a couple reasons.  One, the Exorcist portion of the film, though awesome and atmospheric, is somewhat generically written.  And well, the storyline overall is somewhat predictable of a haunted house with typical tendencies and the occasional cliches coming in now and then.  Otherwise, worth watching.

I do think there's one storyline flaw.  The mom/dad tell a visiting paranormal group that the entire family has to live downstairs in the living room because it's their only safe spot, however eventually the daughters go back to their bedrooms which is when the situation gets much worse.  I have a feeling the parents regret allowing their kids to return to their own rooms.  I think the basement and for that matter the entire house (due to the peeled brown wallpaper which was popular in the 70's I know) look believably creepy as well.  Great movie."
1316,5.0,"I must say that this movie is freaking scary! I'm not talking about the no plot cheap thrills scary, I'm talking about a well-written film with good acting with a great director.

1318,4.0,"This time, it's Denzel ""freaking"" Washington as his actor of choice in front of the blue/green screens to create great cinema. You really didn't think they flew the plane upside down, did you? There are some good lines by the other members of the cast you might hear quoted somewhere."
1319,4.0,"Within the first ten seconds of the film, we see female full frontal, so this film definitely had my interest. Side note, I seriously have no idea why half the audience gasped at this scene in the film. Read the freaking rating. Flight is rated R for a bunch of reasons, one of them being nudity. Nudity means private parts, like boobs and butts, and sometimes genitals, so don't be surprised when you see that in the movie. The film continues to follow the life of Whip Whitaker, pilot and alcoholic. Whip leads the fast life of drugs, booze, and sex, and it catches up to him when a routine flight goes wrong. This film focuses on his addiction to alcohol and how it destroys his life and those around him. I really liked the man vs. self theme in this film, as well as how Whip is his own worst enemy. Whip is the only thing holding himself back from moving on with his life and reconnecting with his ex wife and son. Some critics say this is Denzel's best film. I would argue there are much better films he has been in, but his performance here is still nothing short of fantastic, as always.

I had a lot of issues with this film. A lot of the characters aren't likable (especially the lead) which makes it difficult to have any real moral compass in a film that lacks any moral center whatsoever. Plagued with lies, drinking to excess, and an almost abusive father figure, Whip is not a very likable character. Even his girlfriend gets annoying. I didn't like John Goodman either, even though it seemed like most of the audience did. My biggest issue with this film is one scene that features Whip's attorney and NTSD buddy helping him cover up that he's drunk by doing cocaine. This seemed extremely far fetched and silly, and it took away from the serious tone of the film.

Flight takes off because of Denzel Washington's fine performance as an alcoholic and unrepentant liar, but doesn't quite level off because of some silly scenes that make what could've been a great film a good one. Still, this is worth watching, especially if you are a big Denzel fan like I am. This is certainly not a bad film, but it's not really a great one either."
1320,5.0,"I just ordered the entire series here on Amazon for $23. That's freaking amazing considering there are 4 seasons, and usually you pay like $15-$20 for 1 season of a show. I've already watched the entire show as a kid, and am picking it up again just because of how much I like it. Check it out if your looking for a really great cartoon that's on par with Ren and Stimpy (another favorite of mine)."
1321,4.0,"I thought it was a very good movie - a little bit predictable, and often a little over the top with Jack's awesome abilities?  But, other than that, it was ACTION PACKED, and it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  Totally would watch this movie!!!

Did I mention CHRIS PINE?  He is soooo freaking HOT!  And again, he pulls through another outstanding performance as Mr. Ryan"
1322,5.0,"This freaking movie kept me up at night, Very disturbing but without being graphic"
1323,2.0,"Some movies are either boring or bad.  This one's both.

While Sinister tries to mix mystery, drama and horror all into one pot, the results are less than satisfactory.  Ethan Hawke is a really good actor and while I wouldn't say his acting is necessarily bad here, it's severely underutilized.  He's boring for the most part.  He plays a very boring laidback character.  He plays the role of a book writer who sits around trying to figure out the mystery of a family who all hanged themselves from a tree branch in the backyard.  Over and over for *over* for an hour he looks over the clues, secluding himself away from his family in the backroom and only talking to them occasionally for trivial family matters.  The local police department of this small town are either really clueless or they give the impression they'd rather not bring up the death of the family because they present no motivation whatsoever and feel like they shouldn't have even been written into the script.

Now here comes the bad- everything else.  There's absolutely nothing even remotely frightening about this movie.  The horror relies entirely on Ethan Hawke freaking himself out whenever he hears a mysterious sound in the house late at nihgt so he goes around in search of the reason behind it.  The snake in the attic resulting in poor Ethan falling through the floor is a pleasant moment.  Another good moment comes when his son is hiding in a cardboard box and crawls out of it backwards like an Exorcist creature.  I liked that moment because it tricked the viewers for a moment into thinking it was a monster instead of Ethan's son.  Otherwise it seems every time a suspenseful moment is about to come, it quickly dissolves and shifts in another direction where Ethan argues with his wife concerning their children reading his grisly murder stories.  The movie avoids delivering scares at every angle oddly enough and relies on a weak atmosphere to carry it through.  There's a really big unexpected twist at the end that's admirable, but so far-fetched that it's almost laughable and lacks suspense due to the lackluster, uninteresting story we've had to persevere up to this point.

So yeah.  A movie that's at least 30 minutes overlong, Ethan Hawke scaring himself into believing the house his family is staying in is haunted, and oh, when we finally do see the demonic kids guess what they look like?  Children in Halloween costumes.  No creativity whatsoever in making them look authentically scary.  Hilarious how every time Ethan turns around while roaming the hallways one night he's supposed to barely miss a glimpse of the ghost kids in his field of vision except... it's hilarious the movie pretends he didn't turn around in time when it's clear to us he DID turn around in time to spot them.  Applying the finishing touches on a very mediocre movie right there.

I can't recommend such an average attempt at horror.  I really can't.  Is Hollywood even trying anymore when it comes to horror?"
1324,3.0,"This is a movie that I wanted to like more than I did. I met the screenwriter at conventions and he seems pretty cool. The opening 10 minutes that set up the movie were an intriguing combination of decent acting and subtle exposition. Ethan Hawke plays a true crime writer who moves into a house that is a crime scene in order to write that one book that will make him famous. As he starts investigating the crime, he sees a lot of home movies that are all very disturbing. His research becomes even more insane as similar murders crop up other places.

It's a great setup but there's a certain point where the movie becomes all about the research. There's only so much tension that you can get out of a man searching over the internet and that's pretty much exhausted in the first 20 minutes. The middle part of the movie is full of just too much research and while this might have been more scary in a movie theater (people are freaking out over Paranormal Activity after all), it really doesn't work very well at home.

There's also the domestic argument scene that adds some veracity to the movie but is also a drag on the last act. The ending has some nice creepy camera work but it is conveying a twist that everyone could see coming a mile away.

Still, it's a fine horror movie with many of the tropes that people have come to expect from their midnight viewing. There's nothing special about it. At points, it drags on with too many ""spooky images"" and ""guy searching for clues on the internet"" scenes but it's not a total waste of time."
1325,5.0,"First off let me say that I freaking love old school horror flicks and psychological thrillers.  I cut my teeth on the original Friday the 13th, Halloween, Prom Night, Terror Train and Fright Night.  The mark of a good scary movie, for me, is the scare-the-crap-out-of-me story line and not a gore fest where you can see the victim's entrails.  With that in mind, this movie is by far the scariest movie I have seen in years.  Damn!  I finished watching this movie an hour ago and I still don't think my heart rate has gone down to normal levels yet.  Without giving away too many spoilers I will detail the awesomeness:

-Move into a house where a murder (or murders as the case may be) happened
-Find a box of creepy old super 8 movies
-Watch said movies over and over again in a dark room while drinking copious amounts of liquor
-Ignore your kids creepy and disturbing new actions
-Add the supernatural factor in
-Add a compelling mystery that spans 40 years and you are the first one to make the connection
-Include lots of visual scares that cause your viewers (well me at least) to let our blood curdling screams that make your husband afraid the neighbors will call the cops because it sounds like you are being murdered
-Good surprise ending that I didn't see coming until the very end
-Sleep with your lights on for at least a week
-Consider therapy for your horror movie obsession...

Now for the cons:

-Why does no one turn the damn lights on while they are searching/wandering around the house?  Sometimes it was so dark I couldn't see anything on the screen. Maybe that was the director's point but it was annoying.
-The wife bugged me.  Who just lets their husband make all the decisions these days and blindly does whatever he wants?
-I just know I am going to have nightmares for weeks because of this movie."
1326,2.0,"This move had its scary points, but overall I thought it was a huge disappointment. The plot was interesting, but throughout the movie it was very predictable. The fact that Ethan Hawke's character seemed clueless to obvious situations, and that he would never turn on a light in the house when he was freaking out made no sense. Worth a watch if you enjoy scary movies, but doubtfully going to be a favorite."
1327,5.0,"So freaking cool!!  I could not be happier with this...it's old school sexy motorcycle goodness. The girls are super hot, & so are the motorcycles."
1328,5.0,"these are freaking hilarious, i love sharks and i love mutant sharks even more."
1329,1.0,"This is not a movie , if anything its long enough to be a two part episode . I like it , but anyone who thinks that anything less then 80 minutes long is a movie is ither an r-tard or just trying to sell as many copies as possible by falsely calling it a movie . Wake up and smell the coffee you gullible power ranger fans , & make shure you tell all of those ripoff artists and others like them that if they want to make a real movie , it better be more than 79 minutes freaking long !!!!!"
1330,5.0,"OMG! I freaking love Miranda! I was so excited when they started showing her again here in the US on PBS. But, I really wish they would make this complete series available to buy here :-( Either way, I'm watching her over and over on the add on subscription of Acorn on Amazon Prime! I'm soooo happy and I have my mom watching Miranda and we laugh and laugh!

Miranda is one who can make you pee your pants laughing so hard. And I'm not telling you how I know this! =) The cast of characters on the show are awesome too! Why can't all of the good shows go on and on! I want more than three!

I would love to have a best friend like Miranda without her pushing me over like she does to her little friend! For those who haven't seen Miranda she is 6 foot ish and she looks like a giant next to smaller people.

But, trust me, if you haven't seen Miranda and have the opportunity to then give it a go because she is hilarious!"
1331,2.0,"If you followed the plight of the real crimes committed by these characters you might find this film interesting.  Only two things make this movie worth watching otherwise, okay, maybe it's three.  1) Tony Shalhoub.  Tony turns in a difficult performance as a guy you love to hate.  He lends credibility to the plot and is always entertaining on-screen.  2) Dwayne Johnson.  Perfect for the role and great in his voice over narrations and in playing his muscle loving, faith-saved character.  He doesn't overdue it and his screen presence is freaking fantastic.  If the movie was simply told from his character's point of veiw it would have been simpler and far more entertaining. 3) Mark Wahlberg.  Not his best casting in a movie.  You just want to like him too damn much and his character in the film is supposed to be utterly dispicable.  You would think that Mark Wahlberg and Michael Bay would have nailed it making a good movie.  They came close, made some pretty entertaining moments - Miami as a back drop is always a great setting - but held too close to the original story of the crime.  Geez, I know you wern't in Hollywood making this film guys, but Hollywood it up a little for the audience!  Watch this fim for the awesome cast."
1332,5.0,"This movie was an unexpected surprise for us...we started watching it one night before bed, on some random TV channel, and spent the next 90 minutes laughing with tears running down our cheeks.  It's freaking hysterical.  So much so, we purchased the DVD.

Having said that, if you don't enjoy slapstick comedy, this isn't the movie for you.  There are a few ""racy"" scenes, so I'd watch with caution if kids are present, but seriously, if you're a slapstick kind of person and love the Wayans brothers, watch this...you won't regret a thing!"
1333,1.0,"When I first read about this movie I was really excited to check it out. The idea for the movie sounded really cool. 26 different directors, each get their own letter, complete artistic freedom, 26 different horrifying shorts. Sounds like a Grandslam, but boy oh boy this popped this one straight up in front of home. Nearly all of the shorts aren't even in English, and to be completely honest I could of lived with that, if any of them would of actually been good. Most of the shorts don't even make any sense. To be truthful there is only one that actually stuck with me and that is letter T. So out of 26 shorts only 1 made a decent impression on me. I have read that they are planning a sequel, hopefully they will get some better directors. A movie like this with directors like Carpenter, Raimi, Coscarelli, Romero, etc would be freaking awesome. Unfortunately this one is a huge dud and you should really pass its not even worth a rent, hell I don't think I would even watch it for free."
1334,4.0,"I'm tore between a 3 and a 4, so we'll say 3.5 and round up (according to my Breaking Bad chemistry teacher) to 4.

The good:  For the age of this the surround isn't bad.  Of course play it on DTS not Dolby Digital.  It's pretty dang good for the age, but I'll give them some slack since it's a 25 freaking year old recording.  Saw the tour this last summer where they basically performed this concert. Blew my mind.

The not so good:  OK, I'm not an idiot.  I understand that in '88 they didn't know we'd all have 16:9 TVs.  The latest Dio release on Blu-ray is in 16:9 from '86 and is very nice in the video department.  But DON'T JUST STRETCH THE PICTURE OUT to fit our new TVs. I'd rather have normal looking people and have black bars on the edge than see freaking looking stretched out crap. I have the capability to stretch out the video myself if I don't like the black bars. I don't think it's my blu-ray automatically stretching it, but I could be wrong.

""Even in my wildest dreams""... God I love that song.  Sorry got distracted.

For a historical piece, it rocks.  But don't expect it to compare to recent concert or even to other bands from the period.  Just be glad they recorded it and get your head out your you know what and rock out!  Up the Irons!

""I'd like to think when I die I get another chance"".  Man that song (and album), has to be one of Maiden's best."
1335,5.0,"This show is freaking awesome!  I absolutely love anything on PBS because they truly make the most visually stunning shows and are right on par with historical accuracy.  The main actor is phenomenal.  He is so wells spoken, so compelling, so interesting that its impossible to not want to know what happens in the next episode.
Pro:
- Visually stunning
- The clothing and costume are a thing of beauty ( I want all the gowns!)
- Historically accurate and gets all the details right  (even the cosmetics are correct at the store)
- Easy to understand the actors and follow along
- You will want to teleport back to WWI and shop in their store
- The love stories are so well done be sure to have some Kleenex around
Con:
- The fourth season is the last season! 
- I don't get to shop at Mr. Selfridges"
1336,3.0,more freaking Zombies...what caused the world to become so obsessed with Zombies over the past 8 years? Ridiculous - and stupid.
1337,1.0,"What can I say without giving anything away? If you saw Vengeance, then you know it was TOTALLY unrealistic and beyond the bounds of believability to think the chicks back then where these fearsome fighters going up against Rome's best warriors!!!! I mean, really! The only thing I liked about vengeance is that Spartacus' rat-faced love-interest got killed!!! Yeah SPOILER ALERT!!!

But now we have even MORE testing of credibility when we're asked to believe that Navea.....the 90lb sopping-wet, sniveling slave girl (who isn't even the original Navea), is now a fearsome gladiatrix (yeah right) slaying mountains of well-trained, STRONG, muscle-bound Roman soldiers???? C'mon people....give me a freaking break!! It was bad enough in Vengeance when she killed Ashur....ASHUR.....A FREAKING FULL-FLEDGED GLADIATOR who not four episode earlier had beaten three Roman Soldiers....and now this???? This chick RUINS the show!!!!

In the first episode of this last season (thankfully), I counted no less than six Eagles they had captured from the Romans. Are you freaking KIDDING ME?!?!?! Jesus Christ....what the hell were the producers thinking?! I SO wanted Navea to die off earlier, and save me the aggravation of always having to yell ""BS"" at the TV when she would beat 2, 3, 5, 7 MEN...all warriors! But hey...at least she had an annoying screech when she'd cut them down!! Ugh, what a COLOSSAL disappointment!!!

And what's with Crassus and his wife? They're spitting images of Glaber and Illythia! Honestly....the ONLY one who added some interest to the show was the guy that played a Gaius Julius (a young Julius Caesar).

Except for Crixus and Gannicus, all the main characters are dead or have left the show....so enjoy the 10 episode slog through a non-stop blood- and sex-filled show that's trying it's best to compensate for the loss of Whitfield at the cost of having a good cast and believable performance!!! Ugh!! Damn you lymphoma!!!!!!!"
1338,1.0,"The Haunting Of Connecticut 2: Ghosts Of Georgia was so freaking horrible, whoever liked this movie must have been really high or too young to know a good horror movie because it blew major balls!!  The original rocked, the sequel sucked!!"
1339,3.0,"I different twist on Hensel & Gretal see's the story told as a modern day stoner movie... however, I would not exactly call it a stoner comedy, as more just a regular horror comedy. There is a couple of scenes I could imagine stoners probably freaking out if they where high, but provided you take a bit of gross gore, it's far from a movie I could imagine would make a druggie that's high trip out, so bare that in mind before seeing this if that was one of your assumptions about this movie.

Hansel and Gretal are typical valley teenagers. Gretal is a pothead, while her brother Hansel is the straight man. Gretals boyfriend is a huge dope smoker and they have just discovered the best weed they have ever tried called Black Forrest. They run out of pot and so the boyfriend takes off to buy some more from the source. He discovers a sweet little old lady is producing the grass and she invites him in for what seems like an innocent cup of hot tea and a bong, but things may not be as they appear with this sweet little old lady. After a few hours Gretal has not heard from her boyfriend and begins to look for him, with all clues leading back to the sweet little old drug dealing lady who says she has not seen her boyfriend at all.

Will it turn out like the old H&C story and the sweet little old lady is really an evil old wicked witch, or is Gretal just so high she's hallucinating the whole thing? You'll have to see the movie for yourself to find out.

I absolutely hate Twilight, but I could stand this film from start to end, so don't worry about witches sparkling or emo dialog. This film is nothing like Twilight or it's tones in anyway at all! I'm not sure I can compare this movie to something else off the top of my head, but it's not a dark sinister or scary film, it's just a bit of a supernatural fun comedy horror with a lot of marijuana in it. I myself am not a stoner, so I can tell you that you don't need to be a reefer addict to enjoy the film. As for seeing it again over and over again? Nah, once is enough. It's a decent rental to say the least, but I doubt you would want to own your own copy."
1340,5.0,"If you thought Something about Mary was funny then I surmise you will think We are the Millers is hilarious.  The only complaint I have is Ed Helms playing a high level drug dealer was not convincing, they should have cast someone more wicked or believable (any suggestions?).  This movie is rated R for many reasons so I would not accompany anyone under 18.  The story is simple and stupid but aside from being absurd it is a laugh plus some.  This was a movie that has poor ratings from the critics and the general public enjoyed.  A popular website is currently at 80% favorably from 30,000 votes thus far.  This movie is not for those who object to the F bombs or the liberal use of the finger. It is just a joyous ridiculous romp of an adventure that occurs to dysfunctional people who get together because at the time they all have nothing better to do.  Stick around for the outtakes after the movie ends they were an added pleasure to a fairly predictable storyline, still freaking hilarious movie."
1341,5.0,What can you say about WRESTLEMANIA... It's freaking awesome. I have been blessed to attend 3 WrestleMania - what I love about the DVD set is... I'm able to watch The Hall of Fame and also rewatch some of the most exciting matches in Wrestling history...
1342,4.0,"Just to be clear this is a review of the WM show and not the dvd which has not been released yet. As far as my thoughts on this Mania:  I thought it was really good, however, once again time constraints almost ruined the show yet again.  There were many things that were cut from this show such as the singing of America the Beautiful, lots of backstage segments and interviews as well as entrances from the Rock and John Cena.  This has become a problem for many years now and it makes no sense to me.  It's not like this was the first or second Mania, it was the 29th.  Shouldn't Vince and company know how to properly fill time by now?  Anyway, let's talk about the show of shows.

The show opened with New Jersey Governor Christie giving an opening promo and then there was a WM opening promo.  After that, the opening match started with Big Show, Sheamus and Randy Orton taking on The Shield.  I was very surprised that this was the opening match but it was a very good way to begin the show.  Lots of action and I was very impressed by the Shield, all of whom were involved in their very first Mania.  Great match but no shocks.  I had heard for weeks that Orton was going to turn heel at this show and when the match was over, he was still a face while Big Show was the one that ""turned.""  I use that term loosely because wasn't he really a heel anyway.  Still great match that went a little over 10:00.  (8/10)

After that we get a history package of the events that led up to the Main Event.  We then get Mark Henry's entrance followed by some short footage of Henry vs. Ryback.  So after all that we see the Mark Henry vs. Ryback match.  There were so many people who hated this match because it was too slow or what have you and my response is:  What the hell did you expect?  This was going to be a power match and that's what it was.  There were a lot of big time hits in the match and I for one liked it.  I think it could have been better especially the ending and the person going over but it was still fun to watch.  I also liked that it wasn't too long and wasn't too short clocking in at a little over 8:00.  (8/10)

After that match we see a commercial, then some special Olympics introductions, then another commercial from WWE, then the ring entrance of Dolph Ziggler and Big E Langston and then finally just some footage of Big E.  After all that was done it was on to the WWE Tag title match pitting Ziggler and Big E against Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan).  This was a good match but a little too short for me.  I do like the fact that right in the beginning of the match they tried to play off of what happened last year with AJ and Bryan where he lost the match in 18 seconds after she kissed him.  The same thing almost happened this year after she kissed Dolph.  I thought he and Bryan had the best parts of the match but I have to tell you, Big E impressed me.  I wasn't sure what to expect but he was good.  Again the match was short clocking in at a little over 6:00 but for the time they were given, it was good.  (7/10)

So after this match we get yet another WWE commercial, that was followed by the entrance of Fandango (which actually was pretty good), then we get a brief history package of Fandango vs. Chris Jericho.  So of course the next match was Fandango vs. Chris Jericho.  Honestly, I hated this match.  It was so bad.  I feel bad for Jericho that he was involved in this one.  They should have had Chris taking on someone else and save Fandango for someone lower on the card.  I was expecting a good showing from Fandango being that they saved his debut for Mania but it was crap.  There wasn't a whole lot I liked about this one.  I hate to say it, cause I am a huge Jericho fan, but this could have been the worst match on the show.  (4/10)

After this match we yet another WWE commercial, some footage of the IC title match that happened on the pre show, a video package of The Rock, a hip hop performance by Diddy and finally a history package of Del Rio against Swagger.  After all that we get to see the WWE World Heavyweight title match between Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger.  Again, to me, this was another let down.  I thought the match was boring and too slow.  I didn't like that Del Rio won and I sure didn't like that Dolph didn't turn his Money in the Bank in like I thought he would.  I mean there were some cool moments in the match but not good enough for it to be considered a great Mania match.  (5/10)

Once again we are treated to yet another WWE commercial followed up by the events that led up to the Taker/Punk match.  The entrances that both these guys had were great.  You had Punk being sung to the ring by the band that sings his song, In Living Color, I think is the name.  Taker had a good one as well that had him in silhouette with what looked like people reaching for him out of their graves.  The match itself was awesome.  It was back and forth, just an emotional rollercoaster.  Great action.  I really liked the fact that Punk actually performed the Old School on Taker.  I also enjoyed the elbow off the top rope onto the announce table by Punk to Taker.  The ending was somewhat abrupt but it was still worth the price of the show itself.  Great match and maybe an early contender for Match of the Year.  (10/10)

So after this match we get another stellar WWE commercial (can you sense the sarcasm yet?), then a video package of John Cena and lastly the events that led up to the No Holds Barred match.  I loved Brock Lesnar's entrance and Triple H had a good one as well.  Shawn Michaels, who was with Triple H (as his career was on the line) also had a special entrance.  I see some people on the internet hated this match but I freaking loved it.  To me this was the match of the night.  It was so brutal.  Chairs were used and the announce table and the sledgehammer and the steel steps.  Just a brutal match.  Brock was spot on for this one and I was somewhat shocked that he didn't win.  I thought Triple H would lose, take over the day to day operations in the WWE and be inducted into the Hall of Fame next year but it was not to be.  I do think this match was better than Summerslam and maybe another contender for Match of the Year.  One thing I was glad of is that they didn't let Shawn take any of Triple H's shine in the match.  Shawn got destroyed by Brock and the only thing he really did was superkick Paul Heyman.  That was good booking on WWE's part.  Having Brock lose though I think was bad booking.  I just think he should have taken Triple H's career and then maybe started a world title run.  Still, it was a great match and I for one can't wait to see who Brock will take on next.  (10/10)

After that match we get a commercial for the next PPV Extreme Rules followed by a movie trailer.  After that we get some footage of the Hall of Fame ceremony followed by the introduction of the Hall of Fame class of 2013.  To me this may be the best class yet.  You had Mick Foley going in, Booker T going in, Donald Trump going in the celebrity wing, Trish Stratus being inducted, one of my all time favorites Bob Backlund and last but not least Bruno Sammartino.  Once again with the WWE we learn to never say never.  I never thought I would see Bob or Bruno inducted but there they are right where they should be.  Great class this year and can't wait for the dvd release so I can see all of their inductions.

Once that was done we get a showing as to where WM 30 will be (New Orleans if you haven't heard).  I sure hope we don't get a Superbowl repeat with the lights going out.  Also we find out the attendance for this Mania was 80,676 making it the second largest Mania crowd in history.

Once that was done it was on to the Main Event with The Rock taking on John Cena for the WWE championship.  Again I guess they ran out of time because both of the entrances were abrupt.  There was no special entrances for either superstar.  The match itself was very good.  I hear a lot of people talking about how much better it was than last year but I have to disagree.  I think this match was very very good but not as good as last year's.  There was no shocks here, I think we all knew who was going to win before it happened.  In fact I think most people knew who was going to win back in January.  I still have this feeling that they may meet again next year for the rubber match.  Still, great match with a lot of twists and turns.  There were a ton of false finishes and using the other's finishing holds.  Good match.  (10/10)

So all in all this was a very good WM from start to finish.  I hated all the commericals that happened and I did hate the fact that time constraints did once again play a factor in this Mania, but all that being said, this is a good Mania and one worth checking out.  Can't wait for the dvd to see what they include with the special features and also what they edit out.  All in all I would give this Mania a 9/10.  There were some bad matches but most of them were good to excellent.  Can't wait for next year!"
1343,5.0,"What Dark Skies does is perfectly combine Mel Gibson's Signs with the classic 80's film Poltergeist to deliver a thrilling alien-invading horror.  There's a few scenes in particular that REALLY got to me and this is coming from someone who's watched hundreds of horror films over the years.  Proof that scaring me is still possible!  No this isn't necessarily a jump scare type movie like Paranormal Activity.  Dark Skies contains an actual plot that involves a suburban family (a wife, husband and two young boys) who try their best to explain the unusual events that gradually increase in bizarreness as the movie moves along.  Well actually, it's more like Keri Russell (the wife) experiences really strange events in the middle of the night when she wanders around the house, and from there the rest of her family experiences things until it eventually drives them crazy.

This movie takes the alien invasion concept to a MUCH more satisfying extent, which is where Signs sort of got boring and felt like a disappointment (since that movie was shy with the alien encounters with the exception of a few key moments of course).  I don't want to give away what makes Dark Skies like Poltergeist either because I'd be spoiling key moments of the storyline.  Let's just say, this movie does a wonderful job making horror lovers feel satisfied from beginning to end.  I don't even want to mention all the freaky moments because there's so many of them.  Timing is key in freaking out viewers I believe, and the timing here is spot-on pretty much every single time something crazy happens.

This is actually what I was hoping Signs was like back in 2002 when I first heard about it.  Creepy nonstop atmosphere, aliens giving a family a hard time and being relentless about it, solid characters and an exciting storyline.  Dark Skies is one of the best alien type movies out there.  What makes it so special is that these aliens aren't your typical arriving-on-a-spaceship type silliness.  This is more effectively subtle than that.  No these aliens have been around for millions of years, targeting specific families and there's apparently no way to stop them from their mission to torment people (usually at night).  This is why there's nowhere to run for this family, since nobody believes that the events they're experiencing are the result of aliens.  Who'd believe such a thing?  Surely not the cops.  Surely not the neighbors.  Surely not the doctors or the therapists who the family discusses their situation with.

Expect to be scared.  Oh and expect one member of the family to experience the worst fate.  Bet you can't guess which one!  I have to mention one key moment that totally freaked me out.  When the mother thought her son was talking to his brother over a walky talky while in his bedroom, she opens the door... and gets the shock of her life as we witness the scariest moment in the movie for me.  The dark lighting and giving us *just* the right amount of horror at this particular moment made is so good.  Awesome!"
1344,3.0,"Dark Skies wow. I was expecting a little more actually. This has a sort of 80's movie vibe going for it. I was a little disappointed by it. While I felt it would probably be better than a few other recent horror movies, by bar level wasn't very high for it, and I proved correct.  The premise seemed very simple, but yet the trailers kinda pulled me into the theaters to see this film. I enjoyed that Keri Russell was in this it kinda intrigued me even more.  Congrats to the studio for  pure spooky trailers. Now onto the review. The problems I had with the film are, the script, cast, ending, and the suspense level. The script is good, well fairly, but I don't really get what Daniel getting a new job has to do with the plot of the film. I mean we have so much wasted time in the script, with stuff that has nothing to do with the premise. This is of aliens, haunting the family. I don't get why they put a bunch of stuff that has nothing to do with this. I mean so we have the boy, Jesse and he's in this house and he's cupping this girls boob and then her kissing him for the first time. I mean what does that have to do with the premise? I know that it adds an emotional  statues  for Jesse, but I mean it literally  should have been shortened to include just the two kissing, I really don't  find the part where he's cupping her boob  very appropriate for the  movie subject. It would have been sweeter, and a sort of calming notion and to slow the pace, that the beginning had started to give the audience time to relax a little.  Plus it's sad that the script spent very little time with J.k Simmons character. He stole the show. Well now onto the cast. I mean you have a few wonderful cast members and others more  head ache prones. Well J.k Simmons was great as well as Keri Russell, and Kadan Rockett, as well as Dakota Goyo. But the problem with the cast is, Josh Hamilton, as Daniel, and L. J. Benet as Ratface or whatever they call him. Josh is just a headache. He has no idea what he's doing, and poor Keri has to do all the acting for him. He can't make anything realistic if it killed him. His acting is so wooden, that the only thing I liked about his time on screen was when he beat on the other actor I hated on screen, Ratface. L. J. is just plain old ugly, and his acting is even worse you can tell he's faking everything he says, and acts like he was rushed into a bus. Its ridicules! Now onto the ending. I really don't get it. It's set three months after the other ending.  So Keri and the little boy are in his room when the  little phone thingy goes off and starts saying who knows what. That's the thing that got me; I didn't understand anything it was saying. It was way too much jumbling and static. Well at least Keri understood it, because the viewers surely didn't. But what I did like about it is that Keri finds out that they wanted Jesse all along. That I found wrapped up the mystery. As I've mentioned is that the script added scenes that didn't really belong, which brought down the suspense level, of the movie. It did pretty well over all but the suspense went up and down way too much.  Now to get onto the brighter side of the movie, which includes, cast, length, character development, scares, and suspense.  The cast is included on both the worst and best. Because half the cast is great. Keri Russell and J.K Simmons are the high lights of the cast. Dakota Goyo is also good. Keri Russell picks up the slack from half of the cast. She adds much of the suspense, and she actually seems like she is enjoying every minute on set. She was excellent, and kept this movie from going to 2 stars. Keri Russell could not do everything you know, J.K Simmons also steamed up the late middle towards the end, with a horrorific performance.  He freaking scared me to death, with his creepy kinda alien informer kinda cat dude. Loved him. Also overall the kid performers in this movie were a bit above bad too. They weren't great but with a little bit more acting classes and they'd be stars like Keri and J.k! The length is suited very well. I think they knew how to not make it too long, so as to not lose viewers. But not too short, as to include more chills.  So that was well spot on! The character development was spot on for all the characters. You really feel for every character even the less well acted (Daniel, Ratface). I felt a lot for one character more so then others. That would be Jesse. I felt how much pressure he had on him, and that he was very emotional. I felt when he was happy; I felt his character so much that I cried at the end. While the tear was small it was still a tear! I never do that during most horror movies. I just don't feel anything for the characters in horror films except for them being another body bag to add to the pile.  This film promises  some really good scares, and I feel them. My arm hairs stood up when Daniel went into the room to check on Sammy, and Sammy had no eyes. It was scary as hell. And when the birds flew into the window, man that was an original fright, and unexpected actually.  The part with J.K Simmons was also pretty spooky. The suspense level is good and bad. Bad, as I already explained, and good, because I felt the chills even to start. Even though the suspense went up and down it went up more than down for me. All an All this horror movie is smarter than the average horror film but not that higher up. C+"

1346,5.0,"* Spoilers *

Erin is invited to a family reunion and wedding anniversary celebration at her boyfriend Crispian's parents' remote vacation house. All of Crispian's siblings will be there with their significant others and she'll be meeting his parents for the first time. Everything seems to be going relatively well besides some typical awkward bickering between brothers until they are savagely attacked by masked assailants. The family doesn't know what to do and acts typically panicked and irrational, so Erin unexpectedly takes the lead in showing them how to defend the house and themselves. How will Erin measure up to three armed men?

I didn't have high expectations for You're Next because it looked too much like The Strangers and every other home invasion film ever, but I was pleasantly surprised. This clever movie takes those tired tropes and subverts expectation to have surprising twists, a fun plot, and fleshed out, nuanced characters. Let's start with the male characters. Brothers Crispian and Felix are the ones who hired to killers to get the inheritance from their parents. They hate the violence and view the murders as an ordeal to be endured despite having orchestrated the entire thing themselves. The killers aren't relentless killing machines. Quite the opposite. They are three friends who have good tactics and were obviously trained in combat, but they make mistakes and miscalculations. When one of them dies, the others are outraged and allow that emotion to get in the way of the task at hand. Too many films portray these types of characters as indestructible and emotionless Micheal Myerses when they are simply people.

Now for the female characters. Erin is the final girl, but she doesn't run around doing stupid things as is typical. She defends herself well, helps the family fortify the house, and isn't afraid to go for the kill in order to survive. Being raised as a survivalist in Australia has its benefits. Zee is Felix's girlfriend who appears aloof and bored with the anniversary party, clearly only there for her boyfriend. After the big reveal, she shows her true colors and her excitement at killing her boyfriend's family. She is there for her own reasons and ceases to try to comfort Felix. Her suggestion to have sex next to Felix's dead mother is flatly rejected, but, coupled with her general attitude, acts to subvert expectations about female behavior, which is usually disgusted and scared by violence and disinterest in sex. Felix's mother Aubrey is more of a stereotypical woman who runs around panicked and does stupid things as a result. However, she sensed something was wrong right when they arrived. Everyone dismissed her as a hysterical woman freaking out for no reason despite the fact that the front door was unlocked and strange sounds were heard in the house. If they had listened to her, a lot more people would be alive. Then when her daughter dies, she takes the time to break down emotionally and mourn her. Too many people in horror films watch loved ones die in front of them and simply go on without a second thought when Aubrey's reaction would be more realistic.

In the final scene of the film, Crispian tells Erin that the plan was to kill his family, but leave her as an unbiased witness to guarantee that he and Felix would get the insurance money. He then tells her if she reacted as a woman should, the plan would have been successful. His own concept of women is quite narrow and doesn't take into account the variety of women that exist like Zee and Erin. He not only blames her for the failure of his plan, but basically says she doesn't act like a woman. Crispian reveals himself to be a despicable human being willing to murder his family for money and a misogynist who can't fathom that women exist outside his narrow view of what is feminine.

You're Next is a fun film that takes a cliche story line that we've seen a thousand times and makes it interesting by subverting those expectation and giving us more realistic characters. It also doesn't take itself completely seriously and has some genuine moments of humor. My favorite death scene was comically over the top and involved a blender. The acting is spot on all around, especially by Sharni Vinson as Erin. You're Next is easily the best horror film of 2013, so watch it if you haven't yet."
1347,3.0,"The acting was terrific, and I rarely say that.  The plot was so unbelievable that I found it hard to concentrate on the action in the movie.  The script was pretty good, but there should have been some cheap amusing one liners in there somewhere.  I can't see myself paying to watch this because on the whole, seriously?  If North Korean army guys set foot on the White House lawn, the freaking tourists would mow them down.  Imagine an entire platoon of guys like the protagonist?  Those are the receptionists in the White House.  The real secret service would eat guys like him for lunch.  People in other countries whisper about the training of our praetorian guard for good reason."
1348,5.0,"I thought the first Insidious movie rocked so when the 2nd one came out I just had to see it right away in the theater and I loved every minute of it!!!!  The story was awesome, the acting was phenomenal, and it scared the living s*** out of me and my wife!!!!  I've been watching horror movies ever since I was 5 years old and I love them a lot and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves to be scared because it is that freaking good and extremely creepy and scary as hell!!!!"
1349,1.0,Terrible movie. By the end I was hoping for the entire family to die. They don't even exact revenge at the end. If they did that i may have liked it better but the whole thing was just awful. Why would you even let the kid have the code to the security system and why did the parents not punish him? I feel like if I let some stranger into our house on the one freaking night a year that all crime is legal i would have been spanked or grounded or something. I mean what the hell?
1350,4.0,"I admit it, I got sucked into 'Olympus Has Fallen' from the first, fairly nail-biting scene.  The film's come under a lot of criticism both for its ""anti-Asian sentiment"" (bull-crap, the bad guys here are North Korean, giving the Middle Easterners a break for once ... and let's face it, lately the North Koreans haven't been so friendly in real life either.  The other critique comes from the supposedly unbelievable plotting, starting with no less than Gerard Butler's character singlehandedly fighting an army of armed professional killers ... but to me, for films like this a suspension of belief is mandatory; you have to just set logic aside and enjoy from the gut.  This film is like 'Die Hard at the White House' and it grabs and holds you for its entire two-hour run.

Gerard Butler plays Mike Banning, bodyguard to no less than the President of the United States (Aaron Eckhart) ... until a tragedy not of Banning's making gets Mike relegated to a desk job at the Treasury a year later.  But when the White House itself comes under siege by a veritable army that strikes by air, land and even from within, as the body count grows way into double digits it comes down to Banning and his inside knowledge of both the White House and President to make his way into the captured 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, making his way down to the underground bunker where the President remains captive.

Films speak best to me when the plot or characters are so real that I become engaged in what's going to happen next.  With 'Olympus Has Fallen' if you're seeking deep plot or characterization then BOY are you watching the wrong film.  But once in awhile, much as you like filet mignon, a fat hamburger piled high with toppings just yells comfort food - and that's what this film did for me.  PURE propaganda, mindless action/violence, and an adrenaline-charged homage to America are what you have hear, and damnit but it's just sort of a blast to watch.  Also very involving; at times, the more they destroyed and desecrated the White House, as an American it was such a violation, I found myself fairly itching to tear into the screen and rip the faces off the bad guys for destroying such an iconic symbol of the USA.  It was an unnerving feeling, but I ran with it, jazzing up my adrenaline even more for a film that's brainless and silly and as far-fetched as Kim Kardashian getting a Master's degree ... but damnit, still so freaking engaging from start to finish."
1351,4.0,"I think I like this movie so much because it's obvious that the cast had a blast filming it. Most movies about an apocalypse are either dramatic or scary - or both - but this was a fresh and hilarious take on how the end of civilization would affect Hollywood...namely a group of actors/friends. Jonah Hill and Danny McBride were particularly funny; I actually cried laughing at the possession scene and porn magazine scene. And the ending? I won't spoil it, but as a kid of the 90s I freaking loved it!

The humor in this movie is definitely vulgar, so you might want to pass if that's not your thing. But if you're cool with that, get this movie! I've watched it a few times now and still laugh every time."

1356,1.0,Complete freaking crap
1357,5.0,"In all of its crudity, it was just funny.

Not that I'm recommending it for everyone, because I know a lot of people are offended by this type of humor, and This Is The End takes it to Kevin Smith levels of crude and, probably, even beyond. Really, you have to see it to know what I'm talking to about, because I can't talk about it without spoilers.

First thing, you really need to have seen Pineapple Express to get some of the jokes in This Is The End. In a lot of ways, TITE is the real life sequel of Pineapple. So, if you've seen Pineapple and liked it, you'll probably like TITE. If you didn't like Pineapple, you definitely shouldn't bother with TITE.

The idea is that the end of the world is happening and a group of friends are hiding out together. Let me say that again: a group of ""friends"" are hiding out together to escape the end of the world. Except one of the guys (Jay Baruchel) really doesn't like any of the other people, and none of them really like one of the guys (Danny McBride), especially since he (McBride) wastes half of their food on the first day. It's one of those ""what would happen if you were locked up with your best friends"" kind of scenarios. How long would you maintain?

And it all starts with a party where no one notices that the end of the world is happening, which is a joke in-and-of itself and pretty priceless, if you ask me. The Emma Watson's bit (which is shown in the trailer), because she's at the party, too, is hilarious. As is Michael Cera.

The thing about a movie like this is that the cast, who all play themselves, really has to be able to make fun of themselves. Parody themselves. Make all the things we think about them larger than life whether those things are true or not. And who knows how much of any of it is true other than those guys, but they were brilliant at it in this film. Especially James Franco. I don't care what people say about him, I'm convinced the man is one of the smartest actors in Hollywood. Hmm... that may not be saying much, so let me say he's just pretty freaking smart.

The best part, though, is the writing. What you expect is just some pretty straightforward crude humor, and it's full of that. I mean, the f*(& count is pretty high (did you know that wikipedia has an entry for the movies with the highest uses of that word? I do, now). However, there's some pretty complex and subtle writing going on, too, which is pretty awesome if you can see it under all of the other depravity of the movie. But, again, I can't talk about it without giving it away.

So, here at the end, let me just say that if you like this kind of humor, even if it's a guilty pleasure kind of thing, then you should go see this movie. Or, at the very least, plan to rent it. You know, as long as the End doesn't come beforehand..."
1358,3.0,"I'm honestly not really sure why I'm even writing this. If you watched the first two films and cared at all, you're getting this. If you're like me and watched Evangelion during its original series coming to fruition, you'll watch it and...Well...Maybe not as fondly.

Look, a few key points out of the way.

First, watch the first two films if you haven't in a while, or you'll be completely lost from the get-go. There is no backtracking, nothing in the way of ""THE STORY THUS FAR"", nothing even close to that. Moreover, this story has almost nothing to do with the original, so thinking you'll be okay if you can recite the original's script isn't really good enough. It's its own thing.

Second, this isn't even really in the spirit of Evangelion, at least not the kind I'm used to, because it's in almost no way a character-driven story. In fact, there's virtually no character development at all, or even any scenes that have character development. Everything is kept vague to an overdriven maximum, particularly when it comes to motivation and emotional development. It's just not there.

Third, and this is to both put your mind at ease and enforce your assumptions, this is one big Kaworu showcase. Some have said there are homosexual overtones between the two, and those people are wrong. There aren't. At all. There never have been, unless you're destructively ignorant when it comes to what Kaworu represents (by the creator's words, if you need them). It's 100% ""Shinji makes a friend who actually seems to overtly care about him, and is able to show it"", which is essentially the same theme the television series had. Arguably even less so because the TV series had a bath scene that isn't comparable to anything here. Seriously, it'd annoy me to death if they went the fangirl-service route, and they didn't, they resisted that and kept the integrity of their relationship at its core, so I'm glad about that.

Fourth, this film is to Evangelion as Man of Steel is to the original Superman comics. Or Chrono Cross is to Chrono Trigger. Or Master of Orion 3 is to Master of Orion 2. Okay, I spent a good three minutes trying to think of good examples, and that's the best I can do, but the point is it's super-different in virtually every way that means anything to anyone, even if it technically has the same universe involved. I mean, you know, with some liberties, of course.

Going with that, I'd still recommend seeing it, if you really want a recommendation, but with a lot of trepidation and a freaking massive amount of caution in your expectations. The fact is, they won't match. Whatever you wanted to happen in 3.33, it almost certainly does not. Whatever you wanted to see more of in 3.33, it almost certainly does not happen; or if it actually does, is not presented in a way that you wanted.

It's pretty, it's got some cool scenes, and it's worth at least a view, but the fact is that it feels like dead filler between 2.22 and whenever 4.44 happens. When you almost completely lack character development like this, you're really taking away from what makes Evangelion cool to begin with. And, naturally, if you do take the characters away (or at least, almost all of them in favor of a couple), you'd sure as hell better make what's on the screen worth the sacrifice.

And, well, no, that sacrifice doesn't feel worth it. It's Evangelion in image, for the most part. Not so much in spirit. Or creativity, for that matter.

And, perhaps most importantly, it's not as good as 1.0 or 2.0. Not even close. Something just went wrong here that didn't really happen in 1.0 or 2.0, primarily in the way of story and presentation, but you could take that to many levels.

I already am sad that I didn't see more of Touji's sister, because I thought she was going to...Get more of a chance, I guess, to be a character. For someone who is presented as important at first...I mean, the whole film feels like that, really. In short, it's ""Here's the characters. Now watch as we don't do a thing with almost any of them. Now, here's some more Kaworu and Shinji, sans substance."""

1360,1.0,"First off, I really like the idea for Iron man 3! I was looking forward to this villain! Come on, its the freaking Mandarin!

I was looking forward to the idea of mad/genius scientist againts Toney Stark ideas. Battle of conflicks. Mandarin I'm talking about also have 10 power rings! That could come from the alien technology of a crashed space ship. Each ring has a different power and placed on each finger!

No What we got is a some poor sho, from the streets, drunk and partying with many booze and women... Boring! Well, not the women part!

Movie ok just by itself, but I don't know about you. But I'm tried of movies productions killing off villains and list is very long! Only villain that I can think of that got away to bring back chaos is Cobra Commander in the GI JOE movie! Go fig? Two, Movie productions making the villains very lane lane lane lane lane... Could I say more. But wait there been a few villains that, with rewrite was brought out even better... Thats another story...

Still, this is Iron man don't care if its the 1st 2nd or 3rd, Robert Downey, Jr, plays Tony very good. I give cridet where credit is due! Keep up the good work. Just wish that the villians from all your movies in Iron man was not so lane. Even though the actors play their parts very well. It was the story line that failed.

No the blame has to go to the writers! And moive prduction dirctors! For there lack of in sight. There a diffient between a good movie and a great."
1361,1.0,"Everyone was excited over Avengers. It made over $1 billion in the box office and was a huge success. Well, because of that, it was a gimme Iron Man 3 would be a smash hit as well. But here's the problem. The movie made over $1 billion in the box office, but the movie itself was a massive let-down.

For starters, the film is called IRON MAN 3. Meaning Tony Stark as Iron Man. But at least 98% of Iron Man sequences are the suit controlled by Tony from another location or by Jarvis. And when Tony did get in the suit? The suit was rendered immediately useless by someone with Extremis powers. The Mark 42 was a joke. It kept falling  apart, and that joke got old FAST. But they kept using that joke. Even in the end when Tony looked like he was about to be killed by the ""real"" Mandarin, he spots Mark 42 coming while Jarvis controlled suits are fighting Extremis soldiers, he says, ""the prodigal son returns"", and it immediately fell apart. I remember hearing everyone around me laughing at that scene. And all I could think was, ""what, you still think it's funny after the first 20 times it fell apart?""

What the movie got right: Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark.

What sucked about the movie: You name it, it sucked.

For starters, they build up the Mandarin as this dangerous terrorist, even doing this big thing showing that he has the President willing to cater to him to protect innocent people. Then when Tony confronts him, without his suit of course, I mean, who wants to see an Iron Man movie where he's actually wearing the armor? When he confronts the Mandarin, it's revealed that this big bad terrorist is just an actor hired by Killian (the ""real"" Mandarin) to distract people. That way while the FBI and Shield (oh wait, SHEILD isn't in this movie, even when the President is kidnapped, Nick Fury doesn't even send one agent to help) will be chasing the actor and not the real threat. Killian kidnaps Pepper, pumps her full of Extremis, which makes her invincible, and when she falls into fire, she doesn't die.

In fact, Pepper beats the bad guy! After every suit Tony uses to try to beat the bad guy is wrecked, Tony is left whimpering in a corner while Pepper beats the bad guy. Pepper is all upset because Tony spends more time with his suits than with her, so he blows up all of his suits. Then in a voice-over narration, Tony reveals that they cured Pepper (even though it was mentioned that there was no cure). TOny has his arc reactor removed from his chest, which he didn't think to do in the first movie? Then Tony looks at the remains of his house, and says, ""I'm still Iron Man."" Yeah, because blowing up all of your suits and removing the power source didn't effectively neuter you from being Iron man or anything. I forgot to mention the freaking kid. They do this lame bit where Tony is hanging out with a little kid who helps him when he's in a small town investigating an Extremis explosion, similar to what injured Tony's friend Happy (who thought that name up?). The kid saves Tony at one point. Meaning Tony spent more time being saved by other people than by actually being the badass the first 2 movies and Avengers painted him to be. Oh, and the ""invincible suit of armor"" was easily broken by the kid. The kid just popped a finger off effortlessly. Which might explain why Tony destroyed all of his suits. The more he made, apparently the worse they got. Must have been shame, not pandering to his woman.

This movie sucked. After a solid Phase One, Marvel has started out Phase 2 with a big ole turd. Pass it up. Maybe rent it, but don't buy it. Frankly, the only movie from Phase 2 that seems to have any real potential is Thor: The Dark World. And that'll obviously be ruined by the fact that Natalie Portman has been upgraded from supporting cast to main cast. Meaning she'll probably beat the bad guy while Thor watches on."
1362,3.0,"Didn't mean to, but I went into watching OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL with a semi-closed mind, after reading review after review citing the bad casting of James Franco (even though I am rabid for Franco; love the guy!).  Sure enough, Franco was, indeed, a bad casting choice for the lead role ... but, to me, even worse was Mila Kunis as Theodora/the Wicked Witch of the West.  Margaret Hamilton set a DAMNED high bar for the role, and Kunis never comes off as menacing/wicked enough.  Hell, even her slighter height, toward the end when Theodora is playing side-by-side with wicked sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz, who is wonderfully evil), completely diminishes the power of the character.

That's the negative; the positive is the 'Oz the Great and Powerful' is freaking BEAUTIFUL to look at.  Director Sam Raimi has infused the film with all the color, majesty, and eye candy needed to pay homage to 'The Wizard of Oz' classic - and much as I hate to admit it, Michelle Williams (not perfect, but good), Zach Braff (even voicing the winged monkey Finley, Tony Cox (who can convey more sardonic wit with one look than many actors can do with dialogue), and the rest of the supporting cast make the movie enjoyable ... even fun.  Franco isn't THAT bad in the role, especially as Oz gains his footing and goes from con man/magician to realizing his destiny, but through the entire picture he just feels ... off.  Like a framed painting hanging just slightly crooked on the wall, that never seems quite straight no matter what you do.

Worth seeing?  Definitely.  And kids will love it (though it may be too intense for the younger ones; the Wicked Witch's evil monkeys, fairly vicious in appearance, fly right into the camera a few times, thanks to the film's being shot in 3D).  You just may leave with the thought that it might have been so much more ..."
1363,2.0,"Loved this movie when I first saw it in the theater, have had a soft spot for it since. When I saw it was coming to blu, I got excited and immediately pre-ordered it. Received it in the mail today and...wow...am I disappointed. I see no real difference in the video from the DVD (some, but not much)...the sound is a little better...but what is the WORST thing is that this is not just a ""bare bones"" blu ray...there isn't even a MENU. The movie starts right up...nothing when you hit the ""menu"" button or anything. There is NOTHING but the movie. This is the 2nd Anchor Bay blu ray that I have purchased with this happening (not even a freaking MENU...the other was ""The Entity"")...what is going on with this? How much can it cost to provide a menu with chapter stops or something...ANYTHING? This will be the last Anchor Bay blu ray purchase for me.

2 stars because I DO still like the movie, but dang...the blu ray release of ""Jumpin Jack Flash"" is the crap crap crap."
1364,3.0,"This film was really an interesting film to watch. And I mean it. When it was released back in September 2012, I had no such interest in watching it. For me the film just looked lame. I know you should never judge a book by its cover; I was just totally uninterested in this film.  For starters it had that gangster's vibe going for it. And I just don't like gangster movies, for one and the fact that it involved  killing people randomly, which I like, but this film kind of (for me) seemed to go over the edge and get a little too extreme. When I watched it, it had a very realistic and dark thing about it. What got me threw it all was the mesmerizing performances, by lead Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and supporters, Noah Segan and Emily Blunt. Okay so the issues with this film include  Bruce Willis, length, and ending. Bruce Willis. The man behind Die Hard. I don't know what to say, the guy has lost it. He just can't act anymore, why he does it most likely now is to put food on the table.  Whenever he's onscreen he just doesn't seem to be n it, he doesn't have the same momentum he used to have. The dude unlike Sylvester Stallone just can't do it anymore. He's given up trying. His scenes were very poorly acted.  The length of this film is way too long. I can think of a couple of scenes that should have been cut, or shortened more. It's just way too unbearable.  This film could have made for a decent Hour and a half film, but instead the people behind it added un- necessary additions to the film such as the half naked women in the bed scene, and the ""kid blue"" getting his knuckles cracked scene.  Those were lengthy additions that made little difference to the story. The ending to this film was also a bit of a disappointment for me. It ended with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character killing himself so that the crazy future him, Bruce Willis wouldn't kill the kid. It was a very poor ending. The kid should have just been killed and Levitt's character ending it by killing the future him.  The kid was freaking nuts, and would end up being a ruthless killer. The kid killed people, he was already a lost cause, and Emily Blunt's character man was she a freaking air head. She should have killed the son. Heck with it, I would have, he was nuts. Well now to the good things. It includes the acting, special effects, and character development. The acting as I already explained was very good. Memorable you could say.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt nails another role in the head. He is most likely one of the best actors of today. Every film I see him in is more un- forgettable then the last! He is excellent in his role, and adds depth to his character. And a few supporting cast members as I've already stated were excellent as well.  The special effects, while minimal, are excellent and sharpened to the tip.  The character development is by far the best thing. All of the character's back stories are told neatly and well. All of the character's had an emotional back story, and you felt something for each one, good and bad. You felt their issues and problems, big and small.  Every character was proven to be realistic and had something about them that at least one person could relate to.  All in All, Looper might not be a big success, but it puts its characters in the right place and just seems realistic, and emotional. C+"
1365,3.0,"OK I admit, time-travel films are hard to grasp but I am also relatively intelligent. However, even if you dismiss me, my husband is a freaking genius AND a film junkie so we both could not demystify the plot. It was good. It was enjoyable. there was no way I would have not finished watching it and I have no issues stopping films half-way if they are going to waste my time but alas, I am still not happy with how it all ended. But it had Bruce Willis so really, why am I complaining? :)"
1366,5.0,"I have been an ""Alex Cross"" fan for a while now and I just love the novel series!  I saw the other two adaptions with Morgan Freeman (a living legend) as our favorite detective, Det. Alex Cross.  ""Kiss the Girls"" was an amazing adaption that captured the world of the novel it was based off of so beautifully and awesome.  As for ""Along Came A Spider""..... no so much.  But I did enjoy Morgan Freeman.

Now comes the next step into the world of Alex Cross and we are getting a ""reboot"" this time.  In this third adaption, we see none other than Tyler Perry take the role as Det. Alex Cross and just unleash his acting skills into making the character come to life.  Thank goodness that his time as ""Medea"" paid off.  And we also get to see new blood into the world as well.  Sure, the movie doesn't exactly remain completely true to the novels, but it does a great job at capturing the dark theme of the novels like ""Kiss the Girls"" did.

Okay, I can understand why people don't like Rob Cohen as a director.  The only movie I ever liked that he made was ""Triple X"".  The guy isn't really that good at making a movie.  No offense to him, it's just the truth.  But despite that the director doesn't really have my attention, the storyline wasn't really that bad.  Sure, it needs some work, but it actually has a great emotional presence that just does a great job at bringing the dark and light themes from the novels and into the movies.

The movie is an adaption of the twelfth novel in series, ""Cross"".  The movie doesn't exactly follow the novel like ""Kiss the Girls"" or ""Along Came A Spider"" did.  In fact, the movie actually borrows from the other novels and also just goes its own way for once.  The only thing that it actually remains loyal to, is the fact that Alex Cross is a honest detective and will do anything to protect his family from danger, while going after a killer at the same time.  Even though the movie doesn't follow the novel very well, it does bring the atmosphere of the novel and the dark presence to life.

The characters are freaking amazing as well!  As usual, we have Mr. Tyler Perry, who not only brings Alex Cross to life with his acting and personality skills, but with his physically presence too.  We even see him as a loving husband and loving father to his kids, which we never saw in the other two movies.  We even get to see him in action as a detective and as a psychiatrist, which we are familiar to, but on a whole new level when Mr. Perry goes to work.  We also have Alex's partner and new character, Det. Tom Kane, who replaces John Sampson from the novel series, but keeps a great relation to John's character.  While Tom isn't really that interesting, he is fun to see around Alex, as they make jokes and talk about their fun times as kids.  We also have the sycho villain, Michael ""The Butcher"" Sullivan!  While he is called the Butcher, his real name is never fully given, except for in the novel.  Michael Fox is at his best as the evil assassin and proves to be one amazing adversary to Alex himself.  Michael makes this character so scary, that you will be praying for Alex's safety against him.  And finally, we have Alex's family.  In the movie, we get to finally meet Alex's kids, grandma, and wife for the first time.  While we do get a glimpse of Janelle and Nana Mama from ""Kiss the Girls"", we finally get to see them having big roles in this movie.  Both Damon and Janelle show us what life is like for Alex as he comes home from work and spends his time with them and also what it is like when they lose someone they love.  Nana Mama is.... well... Nana Mama.  Still Mrs. Grumpy and Bossy lady who is almost just like her ordinary self from the novels, except for the moments when she comforts Alex in hard times, which we don't see in the movie.  Maria Cross, the wife of Alex, is indeed beautiful as they say in the twelve book, with the exception of her personality.  In the past movies, there is no mention of Maria, except for a brief hint in ""Kiss the Girls"", when we see Alex touching his wedding on his finger, referencing to his marriage with Maria.  Her character is do very well in the movie, providing a very emotional moment when a unexpected situation happens.  Trust me, all of these characters are done beautifully!  While some characters have been replaced or personalities changed around, you love every minute of them.

I know that some of you didn't like the storyline or didn't like the directing of the movie, but come on!  The acting and the theme of the movie wasn't all that bad.  There are worse movies out there.  The graphics were okay and the fast-pace was almost like from the novel.  You got to love Tyler Perry and Michael Fox as they bring their characters to life and make the world of Alex Cross real as possible.  I hear that a sequel is going to be made, which will be the thirteen novel, ""Double Cross"".  Please try to help get another movie going, because I can promise you this, if a new director and new scriptwriter help out with this new adaption, the sequel will be way better.  Trust me on that!

So, if you happen to be a fan of the novels, you will love this movie!  Trust me!  Just buy it!"
1367,5.0,"Even though this hasn't been released yet I have seen all the matches on this DVD set and I will be able to tell you about them now.  First of all, I always liked the War Games match and the concept.  It was a great way to settle feuds and I am a little surprised that the WWE has never used the match (but then again, if Vince didn't think of it then it must not be good enough).

The first match that you get is the very first War Games match from the Great American Bash Tour in 1987.  It features Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Lex Luger and JJ Dillion taking on Dusty Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, The Road Warriors and Paul Ellering.  This was a great match with lots of action and lots of blood.  Flair was always great in these matches and he shows why here.  I liked seeing the Road Warriors in this one as well.  Very well done match from start to finish.  The only downside is the managers, JJ Dillion and Paul Ellering, because you just knew it would be one of them that would lose the match for the team and sure enough that's what happened.  Still, a very good match.

The second match is either the second or the third War Games match, I'm not sure which.  It features:  Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Lex Luger and the War Machine taking on Dusty Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, The Road Warriors and Paul Ellering.  This match again was violent and bloody but I didn't think it was as good as the first War Games match.  This was to be a return match but JJ was hurt so they added the War Machine to the mix.  Again, the match was good but not as good as the first one which I believe was actually first runner up to the match of the year in 1987.

The third match that you get blows my mind as to why it's even on this set because it's not a War Games match.  This is a Tower of Doom match that took place at the Great American Bash in 1988.  It features:  The Road Warriors, Steve Williams, Ronnie Garvin and Jimmy Garvin taking on Kevin Sullivan, Mike Rotunda, Al Perez, The Russian Assassin and Ivan Koloff.  I actually just saw this match a few months ago and was not impressed with it.  See, this is a triple tiered cage match and it's just hard to watch and hard to keep up with.  It was unique for its time period but not really worth seeing.  It's not even a War Games match so why it's on here I do not know.

The next match you get is a War Games match from The Great American Bash Tour 1988 featuring:  Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Tully Blanchard, Barry Windham and JJ Dillion taking on Dusty Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, Lex Luger, Steve Williams and Paul Ellering.  This match was again ok but not as good as the first War Games match which featured most of these guys.  It's kind of the same old same old by this point.

The next match is from Great American Bash 1989 and features:  The Road Warriors, The Midnight Express and Steve Williams taking on The Freebirds and The Samoan Swat Team.  This was a fun match to watch but it really wasn't violent and it wasn't bloody.  It is great to watch the Midnight Express and the Freebirds though (two of my all time favorites).  The match is pretty good but again, not as good as some of the others that have happened.

The next one is from Wrestle War 1991 and features:  Ric Flair, Barry Windham, Sid and Larry Zbyszko taking on Sting, Brian Pillman and The Steiners.  This is a great one, one of the best War Games matches ever.  Sting is awesome in this match as is Flair and The Steiners.  The team who won the match is a little shocking but still this is a great match with lots of violence and a decent amount of blood.

The next match is my all time favorite War Games match from Wrestle War 1992.  This is an all star match that features:  Sting, Nikita Koloff, Ricky Steamboat, Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham taking on Steve Austin, Rick Rude, Bobby Eaton, Arn Anderson and Larry Zbyszko.  Freaking great match.  So exciting and so fast paced.  Truly the best match on the whole set.  It has a little bit of everything:  Lots of blood, violence, ropes being taken down, Sting on top of the cages, etc.  Well worth checking out.

The next one is from Fall Brawl 1993 and features:  Sting, Dustin Rhodes, British Bulldog and Shockmaster taking on Vader, Sid and Harlem Heat.  To me, this match is a bit underrated.  I think it's a good match when I watch it now.  At the time I was a little shocked that Harlem Heat was in the match and that the Shockmaster was as well (I thought Cactus Jack should have been put in it).  Still, it is a good match with some blood and a satisifying ending.

The one from Fall Brawl 1994 was also a bit underrated and featured:  Dusty Rhodes, Dustin Rhodes and The Nasty Boys taking on Terry Funk, Arn Anderson, Bunkhouse Buck and Col Robert Parker.  This match I saw for the first time a few months ago as well and was actually surprised at how good it was.  There's no blood but the action is really good and the ending is good as well.

The next one is from Fall Brawl 1995 and features:  Meng, Shark, Kamala and Zodiac taking on the all star team of Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Sting and Lex Luger.  This match was also good but honestly if you can't predict who will win this one before watching then there must be something wrong with you.  I mean, the Hogan team may be one of the best teams ever assembled (that generations Avengers) and the Dungeon of Doom may be one of the worst teams ever assembled but it is still a fun match to watch and look back on.

The next match took place during the war between WCW and the NWO and is another favorite of mine.  It features:  Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Lex Luger and Sting taking on Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and ""Sting.""  Great match and a great story to go along with it.  Just the possibility of seeing two Stings made me tune in to see it when it happened.  Just a really good match with a really good ending to it.

The next match was from Fall Brawl 1997 and featured:  Ric Flair, Steve McMichael, Chris Benoit and Curt Henning taking on Kevin Nash, Buff Bagwell, Syxx and Konnan.  This was another underrated match and really worth seeing.  I thought when it was signed that there was no way that the NWO would beat The Horsemen.  I thought this NWO team was just sub-par.  All in all it was a great match with a good ending and a really nice heel turn for one of the people on one of the teams.

In 1998, they changed the format of Wargames.  Before it was two teams of either 4 or 5 guys taking on each other and whoever got the submission or surrender would have their team win.  In 1998 it was 3 teams of 3 men and whoever got the win would win for their team but would also get a world title shot at the next PPV.  So it was a team match but also every man for himself.  It featured:  Bret Hart, Hulk Hogan and Stevie Ray taking on Kevin Nash, Sting and Lex Luger taking on DDP, Roddy Piper and The Warrior.  The match was okay but the rules kind of ruined it for me.  Some of the people in the match didn't do anything to help the match out either like Stevie Ray, Piper and Warrior.  They were kind of wasted.  Still, it's a pretty good match.

The last match is from Nitro in 2000 and featured:  Sting, Booker T., Goldberg and Kronik taking on Kevin Nash, Jeff Jarrett, Scott Steiner and The Harris Brothers.  This was a good match but not as good as some of the other ones that you will get a chance to see.  Sting, at this point, had been in 7 War Games matches so it was a lot of fun to see him in this one as well.  Good match but not great.

The Blu Ray matches are pretty good as well.  The first one is Rage in the Cage from Smokey Mountain Wrestling and features:  Brian Lee, Jimmy Golden, Ricky Morton, Robert Fuller and Robert Gibson taking on Kevin Sullivan, Killer Kyle, The Tasmanic, Stan Lane and Tom Pritchard.  This was a really good match but not on par with some of the others that you will see on this set.  Still, it was nice of WWE to include it on this set.

The next BR match is from ECW in December 1995.  It features:  Tommy Dreamer, The Pitbulls and Public Enemy taking on Raven, Stevie Richards, The Eliminators and The Heavenly Bodies.  This is a freaking good match with blood and really good violence.  To me, this is one of the best matches that ECW ever put on because the action was good and the storyline leading up to the match was good as well.  This one is worth checking out.

The last BR match is also from ECW in 1999 and features:  The Dudleys and Mustafa Saed taking on New Jack, Axl Rotten and Balls Mahoney.  This was the only time I believe that a War Games style match only had 6 people involved but boy oh boy what a match.  So much blood and so much violence in this one.  I liked this match and I think it was a good addition to add to the set as well.

All in all, this set is going to be great.  The matches are really good, with the exception of a few and well worth checking out.  I can't wait to actually view it but I know it's going to be one of the WWE's best releases to date only because it's one of my favorite matches.  If you didn't like this type of match then you probably won't like the set but I did and can't wait for it to come out."
1368,1.0,"After the first viewing I loved this documentary. It was amazingly well-crafted and a powerful EMOTIONAL story that brought me to tears.

But then I started THINKING and upon further reflection realized how dishonest the film was at its core.

The main character of this film was a dead person who couldn't speak for herself. She also happened to be the director's own mother who died when the director was 11 years old. As people tend to do, they romanticize the dead and forget all their flaws. In this movie we are manipulated into believing the mother was just a happy-go-lucky, full-of-life woman who was just looking to be loved. (By the way, all the ""home movies"" that showed this ""full-of-life"" woman were actually RECREATIONS using ACTORS.) But in reality, when you think of this woman's actual behavior you realize she was rather a self-absorbed, self-centered narcissist who cared first and foremost about her own happiness and physical pleasure.

For instance, we are told that the first man she married was too controlling and that she only married him because he was the type of guy she thought her parents would want her to marry. This marriage soon turned loveless and she began having an affair with an actor who she became smitten with after seeing him in a play. Because of her adultery, she lost custody of the kids to their father. Yet the director spends quite a bit of effort manipulating us into believing this was just so unfair to her mother. But had the father been the adulterer I don't think there would be much sympathy for him. And based on her future adulterous affairs it appears the judge got it right: this woman was more concerned about herself, her career, and her own needs than the needs of her children. In fact, her children are then abused by their stepmother and we're manipulated into feeling sorry for the MOTHER because it ""must have been hard for her not to be able to protect her children""?!?!? I guess she wasn't thinking much of her children when she was busy cheating on their father and what the consequences for THEM might be, right? RIGHT?????

Let's look at more of the evidence of what a wonderful woman she was....

She has more children with her next husband....the actor she cheated with during her first marriage. But he claims she was more in love with the CHARACTER he was playing than with the real him. He was the opposite of this character and so she again feels unfulfilled, moves away from the family to further her acting career, and has affairs with two other men. One of these affairs leads to a pregnancy. Does she stay with her new love? Nope. She goes back to her husband and then fools him into raising another man's child as his own thereby denying the child the right to know her real father and financially obligating her responsible husband for the care of another man's child. This child just so happens to be the director of this documentary.

All the interviews wax poetic about how this woman was just unfulfilled and looking for love and how glad they were that she was able to find a bit of that love before she died by having this adulterous affair. Of course, based on her past actions it's likely she would have gotten bored with this ""love"" too and would have eventually cheated on him as well had their relationship led to marriage. But of course we'll never know because she stayed with her husband and then died 11 years later.

We're told over and over how much of a victim this woman was when in fact, the truth seems just the opposite. It appears she was the VICTIMIZER and the men and children in her life were the ultimate victims. Was her first husband really too controlling or was he simply trying to have her live up to her responsibilities as a mother and wife and stop being a party girl? We never got his point of view so we'll never know the truth. If she wanted her freedom why didn't she just stay single and pursue her career? Why get a husband and children involved? That seems to have been HER choice. As was having an adulterous affair which caused her to lose custody of her kids. If her first husband was so horrible, she could have simply divorced him, gotten custody, and then started work on a new life. But she didn't. And for that she paid the same price a man would have paid had he been the adulterer in a divorce proceeding: she lost custody. Boo-hoo!

You would think after her first failed marriage she would try to get to know the next man a little better so she could avoid all the heartbreak for herself and MOST IMPORTANTLY for her children. But did she? Nope. She once again got all tingly when she saw this handsome actor and fell in love with the character he was playing and NOT the real man. Once again, she gets married to someone she doesn't really know, has kids with him, falls out of love with him and then has a couple of affairs, one of which leads to a pregnancy.

Does she own up to her mistake and either get an abortion or tell her husband the truth? Oh no...she lies and convinces him its his child. So the man of questionable character who has sex with another man's wife and doesn't even have the sense to wear a condom gets off scott-free from financially and emotionally supporting the life he helped create. And the responsible man who'd put his own dreams on hold in order to get a higher paying job in order to raise a family is the one who is duped into paying for another man's child.

And then once this child grows up the sperm donor father gets to waltz in and be the big hero for having loved her mother the way her father couldn't or wouldn't?!?!?! And now HE gets to have a relationship with a child he never made any effort in having a relationship with during her entire childhood....when diapers needed to be changed. When homework needed to be done. When clothes and cars needed to be paid for. When college needed to be paid for. Once all the REAL work has been done, the man who had no moral compass and had unprotected sex with another man's wife gets to be the freaking hero of the story???????????????

And to top it all off, the first thing all three of these people (the sperm donor, director daughter, & real father) think when the real truth comes out is: how can I profit from this by writing a book or a screenplay because it's ""such a good story""?!?!? Wow. Truly a family that deserves each other.

Yes, it's a great STORY. But that's all it is....a story. Like Lion King or Gladiator. It's not the truth and there's nothing to learn from it. It's just a story. A meaningless story."
1369,1.0,"Ok, so I'm thinking... I like all these characters AND I'm in the mood for something moody, dark, suspenseful. Great! Even if it's bad, it won't be that bad. I WAS SO WRONG. Even with all those elements exactly aligned, this STILL was one of the worse movies I've ever seen. There is nothing redeeming. The plot is clunky, the characters (especially Stoker) seems like they're struggling to give their lines. The only person who makes it look flawless is Nicole Kidman, but it seemed as if she was in a whole different movie from the other two. And what freaking period were they in? Everyone dresses like they're from the 50's late 60's, but there are cell phones? Why are they using phone booths? Those things could be forgiven in a better movie... a MUCH better movie. Even when they revealed everything at the end it was like *yawn* really? I can't believe I spent $5 on this pile o' crap. I guess I know why I never heard of it until yesterday. The only thing that could be worse was if the ending was of the lead character killing a cop as the wind blew through her hair behind a punk song... oh yeah, that did happen."
1370,4.0,"21 & Over is the directorial debut from the writers of the Hangover trilogy, and it could have easily been called The Hangover Jr. It's Jeff Chang's 21st birthday and his High School friends show up to take him out. With a big interview in the morning, the boys are planning on taking it easy, but things don't quite turn out that way. I was expecting this film to be yet another chance to exploit the magic of the first Hangover film, but surprisingly it does not. The story has many similarities, but also a uniqueness about it. 21 & Over does manage to capture that amazing chemistry and magic that made the Hangover legendary. The whole time I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think, why didn't they put this kind of thought into the Hangover sequels? Don't get me wrong, I liked the sequels, but neither one of this is as good as this film was. Justin Chon, unfortunately only known from the Twilight series, stars in a role that was seemingly made for him. This guy was so freaking funny, that I had to be careful not to piss my pants, almost every time he opened his mouth. The other stand out is Project X's Miles Teller, and while he's much better looking than Alan, he does manage to capture that loveable extreme weirdness that Zack Galifinakis had. It's easy to look at 21 & Over and say it's going to be just like the Hangover, and you wouldn't be wrong. Parts of the film are eerily similar, but the youth factor and college atmosphere does give the film a life of it's own and trust me when I tell you, it was absolutely hysterical."
1371,5.0,"While it's really hard to say who is the best James Bond ever, I know who my favorite is. While I freaking love Sean Connery and Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan is my favorite James Bond mostly because he was the one I grew up with. His movies exposed me to the 007 movies and I've been a fan since. So I owe Pierce (and my Dad who's a huge bond fan) for introducing me to the series. Ever since MGM came out with the Sean Connery 007 collection. There was no doubt they would come out with a collection of the Pierce Brosnan films. It's great that they finally came out with it, but the only include three of his four films. The film that is missing from this collection is ""Tomarrow Never Dies"" which was a great movie. Still, the three movies that are in this set are great movies and they are worth it.

Goldeneye (1995)- Possibly the best movie of this set. Goldeneye was Pierce's first time as Bond and he does a great job stepping out of the shadow of both Connery and Moore. This film was also directed by Martin Campbell who would later direct Casino Royale which ironically would be Daniel Craig's first Bond movie. This was the first Bond movie I saw in theaters and it holds a good place in my love for the bond films. From the begining of the film where 007 and 006 infiltrate the Soviet chemical weapons facility to the climax where James and Alec fight on the hidden satellite dish, this film is a BLAST!!! The action scenes are fantasic and creative. The characters do things you wouldn't count one like Bond driving a tank in a great car chase scene. All the actors do a fine job as well. Sean Bean was great as Alec Trevlyan, the 00 agent gone bad. He was like a mere shadow of Bond and Alec gives you the impression of what it could be like if Bond worked for the terroists. It was rare to see a Bond villain end up being an old friend of James Bond and this film pulls it off well. Of course we have the Bond girls as well.  Izabella Scorupco as Natalya Simonova was really good. She was a strong woman who knew how to follow her instincts and she made a good par to go along with Bond. Famke Janssen as the sadist Xenia Onatopp was darn crazy in a good way. She was a character who enjoyed pain in that werid sort of way. She may rank as one of the best evil Bond girls along with Caroline Munro's Naomi (The Spy who Loved me) to name a few. But my favorite character was Boris Grishenko played by Alan Cumming. A crazy and slezy hacker who was a a former co-worker of Natalya and now works for Alec. His line ""I AM INVINCIBLE!"" always caught on to me and I always found myself saying that line anytime I beat a hard game.

The World is Not Enough (1999)- This was actually the third James Bond film to star Pierce Brosnan. This film was also unfortunately the final time Desmond Llewelyn would play Q before his death. After this film, John Cleese (who appears in this film as well as R) would fill in the role in the next flick.  This films had a really great revenge story to it with the main villains trying to take down MI6 after previous unseen mission. Sophie Marceau was fantasic as Elektra King, young woman who was once innocent but is now twisted thanks to her former captors and MI6's previous use of her. She has that innocent look in her eyes that make you want to hug her, but holds a dark secret behind those eyes. Robert Carlyle was also great as Renard, the main villain. He plays a man on the verge of death trying to give the world one last punch to the face before he dies with the bulliet that's stuck in his brain. Denise Richards was decent as bond girl Dr. Jones (Not Indiana Jones). She was a character that was able to hold her own in certain events, but I couldn't really see Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist. Hey, it's more believeible than Tara Reid as a scientist in ""Alone in the Dark."" Once again, the action scenes are fantastic. The begining boat chase was possibly my favorite action scene in the movie with Bond pretty much destroying everything with Q's boat. I also loved the action scene in the nuclear plant with Bond barly esacping an expoltion in the tunnel.

Die Another Day (2002)- This film seems to get a very bad rep by many critics and fans. I'll admit, it's possibly the cheeseist of the Pierce Brosnan films and it has some silly moments like the main villain who changed his appearance from a Korean to a British man and it's over use of CGI. But personally, I actually enjoyed this film for some of that stuff. It was almost like a throwback to the classic Bond films. Most notibly the laser torture scene was a tribute to Golderfinger. The opening scene was also very shocking to me because I've never seen James Bond get caught and tortured the way he was in this film. It's also crazy how that was all at the start. But othe main attraction in this film (and was the most marketed) was Hallie Berry as the led Bond girl, Jinx. She was a spanky and smart woman who truly knew how to handle herself without Bond. Hallie Berry was great in the role (great looking too) and I think she should go down as one of the best Bond girls. Rosamund Pike as also fine as evil Bond girl Miranda Frost, but the twist of her character wasn't shocking since it almost became a tradtion at this point with the Brosnan films. Two Bond girls, one good and one bad. Toby Stephens was fine as the led villain, but he was possibly the most cartoony of the Brosnan films with a cartoonish method of his plans. The action scenes are always worth it alone with the car chase in the middle of the ice lake being the main highlight.

Overall, this is a must buy collection for those who don't own any of the Pierce Brosnan 007 films. The only real downside is the fact that they didn't include ""Tomarrow Never Dies"" which was the 2nd film of this series. If you are a fan of Pierce Brosnan's 007 films like I am, ths is for you. I also recommend getting both of the Sean Connery and Roger Moore 007 collections if you don't already."
1372,5.0,"Lord of the Rings for grownups. Brilliant writing, casting, cinematography, costumes, set design, special effects and acting. Totally immersive. Some of the best written dialogue -- much of it witty and laugh-out-loud funny -- ever to appear on any screen of whatever size. Shot with the verve and scale of a Hollywood Technicolor movie of old. A lot of swordplay, grizzly deaths, bloodshed and sex. But all of it excellently choreographed and photographed, with much of the action being unexpected and engrossing. G.O.T. is a fully realized alternate time, place and world. And it has lots of smart things to say about power, politics, ambition, the human heart and the human species capacity for both cruelty and nobility. Also, the supernatural creatures (White Walkers, e.g.) are vivid and realistic, and the dragons, onscreen neither too much nor too little, are freaking awesome!"
1373,2.0,"THE GRANDMASTER---the thin line between love and death.

The trailer is to die for! Who wouldn't go see a film with moody, dark shots in rain storms. Fists and feet flying! A really upset looking Chinese dude fighting hordes of nameless Kung Fu fighters!  In the rain! In the dark! Splish, splash, kung fu blood bath! Sign me up!

Okay, watched it. WISH I HAD MY MONEY AND TIME BACK.

If chick flicks with lots of rain, pretty colors, extreme depth of field shots of people looking serious, and slow motion montages of unidentifiable body parts making turns and twists--Is your thing, then this film is for you.

God, enough with the slow motion and rain already! Spare me you self absorbed, narcissistic, over blown bitch of a movie.  OH, SORRY: SPOILER ALERT. LOL!

If you want a classic martial arts film with excellent choreography (Shame on you Yen Woo Ping), fast pacing and an engaging cast of characters, this will sorely disappoint you.

It's actually a drawn out love story pretending to be the story of Wing Chun master Ip Man. What this should have been is a superior update of Jimmy Wang Yu's CHINESE PROFESSIONALS.

Instead it become a self absorbed pseudo Greek tragedy, replete with characters doomed to die before they complete their life's mission, with little to offer other than depth of field photography and way too freaking much slow motion employed during the curiously vague and unimaginative fight scenes.

There's a boat load of interesting characters, including an imposing fighter who uses a barber's razor to inflict severe pain and death upon his opponents. He is quickly dispatched with what appears to be a nail with a chain attached, and he's gone from the film. WHAT!?? In fact, most of the more intriguing fighters in the film, are all looks an no show. Too bad, because the film would have won me over had they played a major part in the film.

The story touches---or attempts to touch-- on the Japanese occupation before and during World War 2, but sidesteps dealing with their atrocities in a few flashbacks, instead driving us to drink with the absurd love story backdrop of this scattered mess of a movie.

Of all the Ip Man films now out, this ranks near the bottom. For insomniacs, it's a sure fire winner. For those of us trying to find a well done action film with a good story, it's like watching paint dry.

You know the magician who holds shiny thing in one hand to distract you from the real ""point""..? Yep, that's this film in a nutshell.

Hey Wong Kar Wai: how about tossing the shiny thing aside and working on making the REAL THING--the story, worth our time.

FAIL."
1374,1.0,"This movie makes no sense. Near the end of the movie, it turns out the flash is bad guy & not reverse flash? At the start reverse flash clearly wants revenge so he goes back in time to kill hes friends so the justice league cant be formed. Well he doesnt. Everything is all twisted

1375,5.0,"Love this movie, so freaking creepy!"
1376,3.0,"MAY BE SPOILERS BELOW!!!!  Though I try to keep main things out.

Ok, my mom and I were going to see a movie.  I had no clue what this was about or when it came out.  I saw something on one of the late shows last night.  It had Jim Carrey talking and showing a scene.  The scene made me want to see the movie.  Oh how much of a mistake that was.  Ok, I guess I should tell you why.  Read on!

This movie had so many things happening, it felt like I was spazzing out on sugar and every time I would come back into reality, it would be a different movie.  Here is what is happening in this movie.

1. A boy with no friends and a busy mom gets something that gives him joy.

2. While doing something from what he got for his birthday, he meets another boy.  They become friends.

3. Time goes by and they become magicians.

4. Over time they start fading away and having less of a crowd.

5. The man looses his friend and tries to do his act alone.

6. Man meets the man that made him what he is.

7. Man starts to fall for a lady that works with him.

8. Man is being out done by a freaking moron who does things to hurt himself.

9. Man has to realize that things must change over time and everyone is important.

Got it?  That is the movie.  Now, seems simple enough right?  Wrong.  I did laugh at parts of this movie.  As did some of the other people in the theater.  But I have the weirdest feeling that I was watching a drama.  I kind of sat there like a zombie.  Some of the things they do is just dumb.  Like when the friend leaves and the man is doing the two man show by himself.  You can see him climb the stairs on his hands and knees.  It was stupid.  ALL the things that Jim Carrey's character did, just made me feel uncomfortable.  He did things that were very intense and would kill someone if they tried it.  The last thing he did, was one of the stupidest things I have ever seen.  Nothing about it was funny.  The audience just sat there silent.  The things that the two men do to try and win a contest at the end, while it was funny, is taken to far when at the very end, you see them doing things to people in order for the trick to work.  That was a common thing with this movie.  They just went on for to long with a single thing  On and on and on.  So many little things happen that I found myself asking why?  This would have been a lot better if they had kept the character that Jim Carrey played out of the movie.  It just made it feel cheap and sleazy.  I think that character ruined the movie.  You get the feeling that you are watching some stupid teenage thing on youtube when his parts come on.  The thing I saw on the late show was not what I thought it was.  Once again, they took it to far.

The title of this review, the movie felt SO long.  Yet, I feel like I learned nothing and honestly have no clue what happened.

I have a feeling that if I would have been seeing this by myself, I would have laughed much more.  If I saw it at home, I would laugh and laugh.  Sometimes having an audience can effect your mood.  When everyone just sat there quiet, it killed the mood.  I will buy then on blu ray when it comes out and give it another try.  But as for seeing it in a theater and paying almost $9 a ticket, all I can say is go with the right person.  Someone with an almost Airplane type of humor.  Other wise you may end up feeling like I did.

Rethinking
I was eating dinner and thinking about this movie.  I think the problem was I did not know the type of comedy it was going to be.  It is very spoof.  The stuff Jim Carrey does is the way it has to be.  His character does shock stuff to get peoples attention.  One of the characters even says he is an idiot.  The stuff when Carells character is doing his act on his own is supposed to look dumb.  He is doing a two man act alone.  So after thinking about what I saw I have come to the conclusion that the movie was funny.  I will buy it when it comes out.

As for what the first person who reviewed this, I would NEVER take a kid to see this movie.  Some of the things are very violent.  While adults can see the difference, I do not believe kids would."
1377,5.0,"When I first heard of Equestria Girls, I thought it was gonna be another another cheap, poorly made trick by Hasbro to get more money. I have never been more wrong.

Many bronies like myself were freaking out over nothing this whole time. This movie had such great songs, voice acting, and great action that I was shocked when I saw it. Meghan wrote this very well, staying true to the original concept of Friendship of Magic. It had enough action for the bronies, as long as some shoutouts to the bronies,but kept the girly nature for the target audience.

Simply fantastic, you should watch it!"
1378,4.0,"When I was recommended Deadman Wonderland I was told it was the next best thing to watching Elfen Lied and had a pretty nifty plot and some cool ideas. What I wasn't told was that I would be subjected to another unlikeable protagonist and all the cool ideas seem to get thrown out the window halfway through this twelve episode romp and are replaced by a fairly uninventive, though still entertaining second act.

The reviews for this show are fairly mixed, and I can see where you can love it or you can hate it. First of all let's look at the story. Ganta Igarashi is in middle school, has a bunch of friends, and is the only survivor when his whole classroom in brutally murdered by a person simply known as the Red Man. Ganta is framed for the murders and sent off to a prison called Deadman Wonderland, a privately owned facility that doubles as a kind of amusement park where the prisoners perform for the civilians. This idea is fairly cool and it gets even cooler when we learn that the prisoners also participate in death games such as obstacle courses full of guillotines, electrified water and snipers. There are also fights called the Carnival of Corpses that are one on one battles between the prisoners. This was awesome. Another plus were the Branches of Sin, something never explained in the anime where a prisoners blood can be used as a weapon. Ganta for instance can shoot blood bullets and Senji Kiyomasa can turn his blood into arm blades. The biggest part of the plot was some of the prisoner's ability to manipulate their blood and I found it to be pretty cool.

With that said, yes, this is a bloody and gory anime, though I can't say it's that bad. Elfen Lied is a lot worse in the gore department, though there are some cringe-worthy scenes scattered throughout Deadman Wonderland, especially at the beginning and toward the end. Personally, there was only one moment where I was kind of yucked out, and this involved an eye being ripped out of a head, but otherwise it seemed fairly tame, at least for something that touts itself as bloody and gory.

The series starts off strong and the story is really cool and the use of this carnival as a device for killing prisoners is both smart and entertaining, but after a second Carnival of Corpses fight, the series seems to taper off and it never uses the setting for anything exciting. The second half of the series never includes a portion such as a game or a Carnival of Corpses, it's just this resistance attempting to escape. In a longer series, this may not have bothered me if the next story arc pertained to another obstacle game or something of the like, but in a twelve episode series, it is disappointing. And to add to that disappointment is the fact that the series does not have a conclusion. It ends one story arc, starts up another, but leaves it hanging. While I understand that twelve episode seasons are the norm for anime, I just wish that decent series would wrap up at least a little more soundly, or even forgo following the source material and try for something different. Elfen Lied strayed from the source material and it worked. I think it could have worked here too.

So the plot starts amazing, and flatlines toward the end with the same generic action and boring scenery I can get out of a long running Shonen title.

The animation is good, not great. The middle school kids looked weird. I mean, Ganta isn't that great looking either, but I couldn't get over how freaking scary Mimi looked. Backgrounds are...blah. The scenery during the first act and the games and fights is pretty cool, but the end of the series follows the characters through dull gray areas and bright white areas and boring brown areas. It's all very unappealing.

The sound is pretty good. I really, really liked the opening. Not only was it a bad*** opening that really got you pumped for the anime (and fit the first act's adrenaline pumping action much better than the second act's dullness), the song was done by Japanese band Fade in English and it makes sense! For those who may not know, Japanese songs tend to intermix some English in the lyrics and it typically makes no sense whatsoever with lines like ""Oh my God is Jesus Christ!"" being sung. This song is perfect English and is also pretty catchy. I sat through the opening every episode because of it and the cool sequence. The ending is meh and doesn't seem to fit the grittiness of the show that much. It's like an upbeat pop song or something. Music during the show is fitting.

In the character department we have some flaws. As stated, Ganta Igarashi is not a fun character to watch. At first I liked him and felt sympathetic toward the fact that he was framed for a crime he didn't commit. But later on you grow to just get sick of his constant crying and wimpyiness. Even the other characters get sick of his being a total loser. He constantly screws up and is constantly talking about saving the bad guys and helping them escape and protecting his friends. He's the classic teenage wuss found in anime such as Guilty Crown, and most notably, Neon Genesis Evangelion. How a kid who whines and cries as much as he does survives a prison as hardcore as Deadman Wonderland is a mystery. I guess it's something about friendship. But I don't care because I didn't watch this to learn life lessons. I watched this to see murder.

Shiro is cool. And not because she's almost naked. She's cool because I know nothing about her, the series doesn't explain much about her and who or what she is, and she seems to be pretty smart because she calls Ganta a wuss. She's kind of silly, kind of sweet, but also the only character who seems to have any sort of depth. Now, I could be wrong, but I felt like if the anime did continue she would be the character with the most depth.

Other notables are Minatsuki Takami, a teenage girl who acts all cute and adorable and turns out to be a crazy-freaking killer. I knew she wasn't all flowers and smiles, but holy cow did I not see how totally insane she would turn out to be. I loved her.

Nagi Kengamine is another pretty decent character. He has a bit of backstory and seems real calm under pressure. He was enjoyable to watch and I wish there were more scenes with him. Senji Kiyomasa is another cool character with very little backstory, but he's a total bad***.

Toto Sakagami shows up about two thirds of the way through Deadman, but he never gets much screen time and the time he does get makes me want to see more of him. Who is he, what is he? These things are never explained and apparently left to a second season.

And that's where I shall start my conclusion: There will be no second season. Sales of the DVD and Blu-Ray were horrible in Japan, meaning this is another anime that just leaves off and is going to be the target of terrible fan fictions for years to come in an attempt to conclude it. Actually, the manga does continue the story and I believe I'll be heading over there to see if it's worth my time.

Otherwise, Deadman Wonderland is probably a 9 for the first act. But the second act is a 6. Which really sucks because I wanted to love this anime and be a raging fanboy about it, but I can't because of it's many shortcomings. The plot, Ganta, some of the side characters being dull, the animation being dull and lifeless toward the end: they all detract from the experience.

Enjoyable, though flawed, Deadman Wonderland is a 7/10."
1379,1.0,"In order to get Elektra (director's cut), Daredevil (director's cut), A duel pack with the two Fantastic Four films, and a pack featuring all the Xmen films (First class, Xmen 1-3, and the Wolverine spin offs) would cost you $103 dollars. All of them are on Blu-Ray mind you. So why the heck would any sane person spend nearly 80 dollars more on this when they could buy them all separately for less? It's a total freaking rip off.

Never buy movie bundles like this because a majority of the time, You could get all the movies in the collection at a much cheaper price than you would this. Even then, Half of these movies flat out suck (Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Elektra). The only ones worth buying are the Xmen ones and even then it only cost 70 bucks to get it in a separate bundle.

In simple terms - Do not buy this."

1382,4.0,"You'd think after fourteen years, two spin-offs, a host of imitators and numerous cast changes, CSI would be a played out hand by now. Living on past glories. Cruising on auto-pilot until the expense of making it outweighs the revenue it brings. Just a bunch of actors, writers and producers spinning the wheels of the gravy-train and playing on audience's emotional momentum.

You'd be wrong.

The 14th Season of CSI is like a bag of movie-theater popcorn: buttery, oversalted, greasy...and freaking delicious. With only a few members of the original cast left, it retains a great deal of the charisma it originally had when it rightfully swept to the top of the ratings heap in its first season. It opens with a resolution to the cliffhanger which ended Season 13 (""The Devil and D.B. Russel""), and after clearing that up, begins the usual yearlong sojourn into the investigation of brutal murders, twisted motives and head-scratching disappearances. Some of the best episodes:

""Torch Song"" -- the CSI team investigates an arson that left a musical venue burnt to the ground, four people dead, and a huge list of suspects behind.

""Last Supper"" -- A cynical-amusing take on murder at a reality game show that looks suspiciously like ""Top Chef.""

""Frame by Frame"" - Kathryn Willows returns in flashbacks for the show's 300th episode.

""Check In and Check Out"" -- this episode, about mysterious death occurring in a sleazy motel, was strongly reminiscent of the Grissom years.

""Keep Calm and Carry On"" -- CSI is very good and grabbing viewer interest early and then twisting the plots until they look like rigatoni; this episode, whose plot is way too complex to explain, is a prime example of this.

""Boston Brakes"" -- The team investigates murders that may -- or may not -- be linked to a shadowy wing of the U.S. government.

""De Los Muertos"" - Nick travels to Mexico to investigate the mysterious death of a young Mexican-American girl. An outstandingly tense, gritty, and black-comic look at a nation on the verge of total governmental collapse.

""Long Road Home"" - Gene Simmons of KISS guest stars in this bloody but often hilarious story of rock-band debauchery gone horribly wrong.

""The Fallen"" - A superbly brutal and twist-ridden story that has a shooter storm LVPD HQ and take Russel hostage.

I mention these specifically but really, there are very few losers in this bunch (""Love For Sale"" is a very good story and ""Killer Moves"" reminded me of some of the earlier ""impossible mystery"" episodes like the dead frogman in the tree or the time Warrick had to investigate the spontaneous combustion killing).  I originally wasn't crazy about Ted Danson being cast on CSI but he grew on me very quickly and now seems as if he's been there for ten years rather than three -- a calm, confident, fatherly presence reminiscent of Grissom without looking like an imitation. One thing I particularly enjoyed was the development of Marc Vanns character, Conrad Ecklie, in the early part of the season. Marc Vann has long been a quiet asset to the show, and now has a chance to show off some of his acting ability with meatier story lines. And the 300th episode was nicely done  I thought it was very classy of them to show Gary Dourdans face, considering the ill-will that surrounded his departure from the show.

Now, the trouble with CSI at this point is not that the story lines are uninteresting (on the contrary, if anything the story lines are now too fantastical), but rather that the formula has become too rigid and therefore too predictable. I used to be wrong about 60% of the time when I tried to figure out the guilty party in the early going; now Im right about 80% of the time (or better). On top of that, the plots have gotten so preposterous as to strain my suspension of disbelief. Is there anyone in the cast who hasn't been shot, kidnapped, killed someone, been the target of a serial killer, etc? And since were on the subject, how many brilliant, diabolical serial killers with a flashy M.O. can possibly visit one city in 14 years? Remind me never to go to Las Vegas! Finally, Ive never quite been able to recover from the loss of Grissom and Warrick. The show just isn't the same without them, and I say that with all respect to both Ted Dansen and Laurence Fishburne, both of whom I enjoy(ed). As for the HD-type image quality, it's horribly unflattering to hairpieces, makeup and age-lines. (Somebody needs to stop the pancake makeup on Elizabeth Harnois STAT.)

Having said that, for a show thats been chugging along for fourteen years, CSI has done a damn fine, even a spectacular, job of maintaining its best quality, which is its sheer addictability. This is binge television watching at its finest. I can go through five or six of these episodes as casually as I can eat a bowl of the afformentioned popcorn. Angus Young once remarked that the greatest compliment AC/DC could get as a band was that the new album sounded just like the old one, and I think that this season of CSI is just like the last one. Tight storytelling. Outrageous plots. Sci-fi science. Stylized dialogue. Vegas history. Mood lighting. Beautiful women. Twisted motives. And corpses, corpses, corpses.

Heres to another fourteen years of it."
1383,5.0,"Great season, absolutely LOVED every minute of it.  Cant wait to see the other seasons!  So freaking excited and cant wait!!"
1384,4.0,"This is a very slow paced film, nothing really exciting ever happens in it, there's no action, it's mostly talking or walking around with a paranoid look on a characters face, but it is still entertaining enough.  The acting by Juno Temple is also very good, who plays Alicia, an American who has come to Chile to hang out with her cousin Sara, who has plans of her own to hang out with her friends on a remote property, you can only get to by boat and tells Alicia to get into there car.  Only Sara has other plans, and makes up a story about having to sit an exam and that she'll join them tomorrow when the car makes its first toilet break stop.  Alicia clearly doesn't want to keep going with these group of people who are kind of creepy, hardly speak English, and clearly see her as an inconvenience.  But Sara makes her and promises to join them.  Upon arrival at the property Sara is freaking out because there's no phone reception, in a rare moment she is spoken to she is informed Sara is not coming the next morning as planned.  Michael Cera's creepy loser type character keeps hassling her and laughing at her misfortunes such as when a dog wants to be more than just friends.  Alicia clearly want to be there, is paranoid they are going to do something to her, isn't really sleeping and just hopes Sara will turn up so she can leave this nightmare.

Although it's not your typical slasher, or psychological thriller, and it is very slow, Magic Magic does work, because the scenario is plausible, who hasn't ended up to hang out with or even stay with people you don't like and are a bit uncomfortable around?  Imagine having to do this in a strange country, in an isolated place you don't really know where it is or how to get back to an airport or whatever, even if you did steal their boat."
1385,4.0,"Really liked this series. Would've given it 5 stars, but I feel my critique is biased by the fact that I'm in love with both leading men. Bias aside, Daniel Radcliffe was very funny (he is really a great comic actor) but he was also able to pull off the serious parts, especially at the end.

John Hamm was great too: comically morose (or perhaps, morosely comic), but with enough abject seriousness to make you believe he was really trying to go back and prevent his life from becoming the hell it is at the present.

Without giving too much away: the Young Doctor becomes a morphine addict, and it leads to ruin. Hamm tries to warn his young self, but it does no good. Of course. There are a million things I'd like to tell my younger self, but I doubt she'd listen.

The only thing that really jarred me about this series is the height difference between Hamm and Radcliffe. OK, Radcliffe graduates from medical school at what, 25 years old, absolute minimum. Yet his 17-years-older self (John Hamm) is a whole head taller than Radcliffe.

WHO THE HELL GROWS LIKE, 8 INCHES, BETWEEN AGES 25 AND 45? People stop growing by age 21, at MOST. There is no freaking way Dan Radcliffe could've grown like, 8 inches, after already reaching his adult height.

And oh yeah...he really does bang a super-ugly chick. Twice."
1386,4.0,really freaking hard. I wish it came with the weights needed for the second work out.
1387,5.0,"The show 'Freezing' is your typical science fiction anime with a splash of harem thrown in. The story is basically this: humanity is at war with extra-dimensional beings called NOVA. The world has no way of fighting them except with teenage girls (naturally). It focuses on Aoi Kazuya who transfers to a school called West Genetics Academy. Genetics Academy is basically a school for genetically enhanced girls called Pandoras & male students with an ability dubbed ""Freezing"" which can limit/restrict movement in the area they cast it on. Pandoras & their male partners, who are called ""Limiters"", are the only known way to combat the NOVA.

The story starts out with Aoi being shown around his new school during an annual event that consists of each & every Pandora (in their year) going at war with each other (almost killing each other) throughout the entire school. The main heroine, Satellizer (who is known as the Untouchable Queen & ranked 1 of her entire class), & another main girl crash lands in front of Aoi. That is when the main story kicks in.

There's a lot of blood, limbs being cut off, fights & nudity. So, it's not for kids. It has a good story. The opening & ending are good. The insert music is freaking great. There's not really much I can say negative about this anime. There's a decent amount of sexual references. There's pantie shots but they aren't as in your face like in Queen's Blade or Sekirei (Sekirei still being good). All in all...I would suggest watching online before the box set comes out in order to make sure you want to buy it. You can watch it on YouTube censored by FUNimation."

1390,5.0,"No One Lives is a FANTASTIC slasher/revenge movie with a sudden and dramatic plot twist 20 minutes in I did NOT see coming!

After a group of thugs shoot a family while they're pulling up in their driveway in graphic bloody windshield-shattering fashion, they set their sights on a couple inside a restaurant because the thug actor played by Derek Magyar has an irresistible attraction to the wife of Luke Evans character.  Of course Luke plays it off as just another idiot who should be ignored when he approaches their table but Derek, well, he's a persistent one!  He wants Luke's wife and he wants her NOW!  He doesn't skip a beat in revealing how much he desires Luke's wife so later that night when Luke and his wife are driving down the road, Derek crashes his vehicle into theirs causing a wreck and kidnaps the two of them right on the spot.  Oh Derek you foolish man you.  He just didn't realize how big of an irreversible mistake he made!

Soon after, Luke Evans reveals he's no ordinary human after his wife is murdered in surprising gunky blood-squirting fashion (involving a butcher knife and a sudden forward jolt of the throat) and sets himself free to murder the entire gang!  Yes that's right- he ALONE goes out on a mission to make every single one of those criminals pay hard for what they'd done to his girl.  You're all gonna pay!

Throughout the entire first half of the film, Luke comes up with his own bag of twisted, methodical tricks to kill each one of those criminals as they hide like cowards in their homes scared to death to come inside for fear of Luke.  Honestly for a bunch of tough guys (and girls, many of which are really cute) they all suddenly change their act the moment they realize what kind of person they're dealing with.  Luke's not a person!  At least, I think they mention he's the undead or a ghost or something.  Never quite sure.  Either way he's out for revenge so look out!

The amount of blood is deliciously high with every single death.  I guess I should have known given the name of the movie that, well, you know.  Just read the name of the movie!  What does it say?  It certainly doesn't say Everybody Lives now does it?  But does everyone die?  Hmmm... Well to be honest without spoiling the ending, I'm surprised a certain someone died a couple minutes before the movie concludes.  I mean that particular person really should have lived given everything he or she's been through, don't you think?  I like the guy who gets his head chopped up just a *little* bit, haha!  Just enough to cause bleeding, but keeping him alive for the time being to allow him a special moment to spill his guts (no pun intended).  And the sound he makes while dying?  It turns my stomach since it sounds somewhat authentic.  What about Brodus Clay?  I thought he looked familiar but I wasn't sure it was him until I came online and did some google searching.  He's not exactly the brightest guy in the world and certainly not a survivor.

I'm really surprised Derek Magyar lives for the majority of the film given he's the type that usually dies early, but he IS perhaps the best actor in the movie.  He's very believable in his scumbag/criminal role.  Of course Luke Evans is magnificent as well.  Adelaide Clemens is unfortunately a not so good actor.  Yeah she's cute and yeah she has that innocent way about her that appeals to me, but I dunno, her emotions were never believable when she should have been expressing EXTREME DIRE fear.  Instead her voice shakes in a fake and unnatural kind of way like she sees a mouse in the corner of the room instead of totally freaking out (which is what she SHOULD have done).  The movie focuses on Adelaide quite a bit so it's impossible not to notice her acting abilities or lack of.  Still, she's cute and good enough for the role I suppose.  She's a key part of the movie anyway.

Otherwise, great movie!  You can't go wrong with violent deaths, blood gushing awesomeness in the night, pretty good acting from most of the cast, and a quality storyline."
1391,5.0,I just watched this movie on Netflix and I loved it. It had several scary scenes where the freaking tv was up and the loud gonna get you noise creeped me out! I just love these B movies or whatever this one is considered. I have it on my wish list to buy. If you like creepy movies and don't judge everything by gore and a lot of drama then check it out!
1392,5.0,"Is ""freaking awesome"" appropriate when reviewing a film?! I dunno but this series was a perfect blend of mystery, creepy, scary, intimate, and intense."
1393,3.0,"After Marvel's insane success with The Avengers and all accompanying films, DC has decided they are going to take on their rivals on the field of movies with a cinematic universe of their own! And that universe began in 2013 with the release of Man of Steel, a reboot of the Superman series.
This film is great, but it also has it's fair share of flaws, so i'm going to get all the negative stuff out of the way first.
The dialogue during the final fight between Superman and Zod was terrible. It sounds like David S. Goyer's kid got a hold of his dad's laptop and rewrote everything because there are lines like ""Your a Monster Zod, and I will stop you!"" and ""There's only one way this ends: either you die, or I do!"". Oh, and who can forget the general's line at the end ""Are you effing stupid?!(Seriously?). It's funny because the dialogue was fine up until that point.
The plot was pretty overstuffed at times, particularly with the Kryptonian stuff. The whole ""codex"" subplot, involving information of Kryptoneons yet to be born or something like that, was so confusing and convoluted. The Krypton backstory in general was so confusing and convoluted. Something about outposts and genetically modified babies and that leading to the core collapsing or something like that. There's a scene when Jor-El tells Clark that he was Krypton's ""first natural birth in centuries and that was the reason they risked so much to save him. I mean wait, hold up, I thought the reason you saved your son was because he was your ""effing"" son and you ""effing"" love him! Im sure thats not what he meant, but still.
Also, Lois always magically shows up wherever the plot needs her. Zod requested her to come on his aircraft. WHY!? Durning the final battle, shes on the aircraft carrier flying into a war zone. WHY!? She even finds her way to that train station at the end! Dont get me wrong, Lois is great and Amy Adams is a great actress and did a great job in the role, but it's frustrating how the writer unapologetically makes her show up everywhere without anything resembling a explanation!
There are other things I could complain about, particularly the character development or that the film was really lacking in wit, but nah, I want to get to the fun stuff!
Aside from all that, I thought this movie was absolutely fantastic!
The opening on Krypton was so freaking awesome! Krypton openings in Superman stories are always very talky, so it was such a pleasant surprise when during the council meeting the doors just blow up out on nowhere. Everything that follows is just so flipping fantastic, from the effects to Hans Zimmer's incredible music.
It was very smart having Zod as Supermans first villain! The whole story was kind of epic, in that Zod was Jor-El's nemesis and now 33 years later becomes the enemy of Jor-El's son on another planet. It's kind of an epic story. That's probably just me though.
Zach Snyders directing was so good! So many visually fantastic shots. And that brings me to the action sequences, which thanks to Zach Snider are all so epic and awesome!
The whole cast is very good, especially Michael Shannon, who is outstanding as Zod! Seriously though, Snyder brought in an all star cast who all do fantastic jobs bringing these beloved characters to life.
And, Hans Zimmers score is amazing! Seriously, one of the best movie scores this decade!
My favorite part of the film is that this is the first movie and Lois already knows that Clark is Superman! I just think that is such a great route to take that saves us so much time with the whole Lois can't figure it out thing not just with this film, but for any sequels!
Overall, this is a great movie that has me excited for everything to come from the DC Extended Universe!"
1394,3.0,"nice to see so many great actors. superman was played as quietly intense by the actor playing him, as is usual for superman. lots of fighting. bit of an odd point in the story for superman and Lois Lane to kiss but whatever. looks very expensive. I want to rate it two and a half stars cause the story is so weak but there are so many actors I like in it and the visuals are so amazing, rounded up to 3. I say it's a weak story cause kinda episodic. we see clark's childhood in flashbacks through a series of bullying incidents where he's the victim, and we see him struggling to cope with his special skills and freaking out as a grade schooler, and he's an adult drifter, until he finds a ship sent from his planet, and obtains answers from his father's technological ghost, and unknowingly activates a beacon which informs his nemesis of his location and brings his enemies to earth where they engage in a worldwide smackdown. property damage from building destruction easily looks to be in the hundreds of trillions of dollars though no one mentions suing superman, post-battle. totally unbelievable that the government couldn't discover his true identity or where his mom lives; if Lois discovered it, the government could. worth a watch for the actors and visuals."
1395,5.0,"Simply put: Man of Steel was freaking awesome. I have been waiting for this type of Superman movie for longer than I can remember.  The original Superman movie was a good flick for its time, and Christopher Reeves did a masterful job of making us believe Superman could hide his identity behind the faade of a bumbling Clark Kent. But I'm not ashamed to admit I am from a generation that loves spectacular action and special effects, and I have been craving a Superman movie that really taps into the modern day potential of movie magic, with an equally engaging storyline and characters. Man of Steel delivers in spades.

I don't give this praise lightly. I had serious reservations and doubts about this movie going into the theater. The bitter taste of Superman Returns was still fresh in my memory. I know the critics have been espousing that the former movie was better than people gave it credit for, that it actually got better reviews, etc.  Maybe Superman Returns wasn't a bad movie, but it certainly wasn't a good movie either. At best it was a ""blah"" movie, and for a Superman movie that just won't cut it. Superman never even throws a punch in the movie. In fact he gets his ass kicked by a couple of thugs while under the influence of kryptonite. In fact the biggest ""super"" feat in the movie was lifting a big rock, incongruously while under the influence of the same kryptonite that allowed the thugs to beat him nearly to death. In contrast, Man of Steel has some serious throwdowns with other Kryptonians. Even the super lifting feat included in this movie, holding up a collapsing oil rig tower, is a heck of a lot cooler than slowly lifting a big rock into space.

My reservations about Man of Steel continued in the early days of the production as news trickled out. Nolan and Goyer became involved, and though they did a spectacular job with the first two installments of their Batman series, I was skeptical about their suitability for the Superman franchise. How would their dedication to ultra-realism translate to a story about a man who can bench press mountains and fly through space? Furthermore, in my opinion the last installment of their take on the Batman mythos strayed way off course, compounding my doubts. We soon learned that Zod would be the major antagonist of the new movie, and while I was encouraged that Superman would have a real superhuman opponent, I feared we would get another poor copy of the original movies, just as Superman Returns came across as a poorly plagiarized version of the original. The earliest trailers for the new movie didn't help either. They seemed to suggest a long drawn out discovery process, devoid of the Superman action sequences I was craving. The most exciting thing they showed in the original trailer was Superman flying. We've been there, done that.

Subsequent trailers offered more promise, though they still didn't show a lot. I guess they were using the old trick of the strip tease, show us just enough to get us interested. In hindsight I'm glad they didn't show or reveal more, because every moment of the movie was a treat, unspoiled by over divulging trailers prior to release. I often despair when I have to sit through another origin story for these comic books icons that I know so well. I'm anxious to get to the good stuff. But Man of Steel managed to make the new origins fresh and interesting, and extremely relevant to the overall story.

And holy crap did they nail the casting of the new Superman. Henry Cavill's Superman makes previous movie renditions of the character look like guys playing Halloween dress-up. This guy looks like he could bend steel, even without the movie magic. The acting was solid all the way around. Superman came across as caring, complicated, and heroic. Lois Lane was likable, smart, and had a real adventurous spirit, and loads of integrity. You could easily see why Superman would fall for this mortal woman. Contrast that with super-bitchy Lois from Superman Returns. Is it any wonder he decided to leave the planet for five years?

Some critics have argued that this Superman is too violent and not true to the character. These people obviously don't know much about the character. Most of Superman's stories (comic books, animated series, original Superman movies) involve violent conflicts with other superhuman opponents. Do they really think we want another movie where Superman battles the elements and catches falling airplanes.

So to summarize, why is Man of Steel the best superman movie ever:

  1. Awesome action that makes great use of the environment (smashing buildings to pieces, mega explosions).
  2. Intense superhuman versus superhuman combat (can you say using a train as a weapon -  gives new meaning to more powerful than a locomotive).
  3. A villain with a goal that makes sense (unlike Lex Luthor from Superman Returns, who thought an ugly chunk of black crystal/rock would make for prime real estate).
  4. A Superman that looks the part (I am very much a straight man - but even I had to think DAMN when I saw Henry Cavill as Superman, and sans shirt in a particular scene).
  5. A Superman who embraces his role as humanity's protector (I loved Smallville, but Clark's crying about being different could be tiresome in the early seasons - come on you can run faster than the speed of sound and juggle tractors - yeah, sucks to be you. Not to mention being able to see into the girl's locker room).
  6. Lois Lane is no dummy (A pair of glasses were never going to fool this girl).
  7. No more camp (Man of Steel has it's humorous moments, without resorting to the type of campy antics that were pervasive throughout Superman Returns).

In summary, Man of Steel is the Superman movie I have been waiting for since I first fell in love with the character. I can't wait to see where they take us next."
1396,2.0,"Besides Star Trek Into Darkness, this was literally the disappointment for my summer 2013 movie viewing. The only thing this movie set out to do for me was take my money providing no real entertainment value. It's an overrated mess of a story for the first true comic book super hero.

The ""S"" stands for shaky.
Zach Snyder's cinematography for this movie is such a joke. I'm not talking about the sets, super use of CGI, or look of the film. I'm talking about his over use shaky hand cam he used to film this thing. Every scene, and I'm being serious here, had a shaky documentary effect that proved to be more annoying and completely pointless when watching this film on the big screen. I thought the Hunger Games was annoying. Heck no, this blows that shaky cam issue out of the water! Also there are segments of ""scenery"" of object emphasis that I thought was tailored only for that teaser trailer that ran in front of the Dark Knight Rises. You get that here no matter what, ladies and gentleman. And to top it all off we have another over used camera effect for almost every CGI scenes. A very Battlestar Galactica (redo series) zoom in tactic when anything flies or falls down in this movie. It becomes so predictable with Hans Zimmer score that you could literally turn it into a drinking game. The Dark Knight Trilogy, hell Pacific Rim's, action scenes are tame to Man of Steel's calmer sections. Why do we need to shaky cam a conversation between Pa Kent and young Clark and why do we need to zoom in on Lois's escape pod as it falls to the ground when we clearly see it the first angle? The fight scenes are what you call the meat and the bones of this feature. Some seem to just go on and on like I was watching a hyper violent Anime like Dragon Ball Z. Don't get me wrong here, Zach's intention of Kyrptonians fighting each other would be on the same destruction plane as this, but at least make them interesting and not a chore to get through.

The ""S"" stands for Superfluous.
Oh boy, then the plot! Which had either too much going on or ended up confusing it self with the littlest things. Because we know if Christopher Nolan is involved as producer and David S. Groyer is here to write the story, then we're going to have things overly explained. Segments like the atmosphere issue with Kryptonians, Kal-El being the first natural birth in awhile, the Phantom Drive and exploratory machines, and the codex felt like moments from the infamous plot shotgun (where writers throw ideas into one barrel then blast it at the wall and try to make sense out of it.) Story elements like these could have been explained easier or completely cut out. Remember Superman II, people? The explanation for why Zod and his lackeys are super powered were explained in 5 minuets. NOT ALMOST THE WHOLE MOVIE. So I'll get this out of the way then: If Groyer states that a Wonder Woman movie is impossible to write, but Marvel literally lets a talking raccoon use a machine gun, then I can honestly say that Groyer knows nothing about how to make Superman interesting. I mean they put Zod into this movie for the sake that he is the villain mostly everybody remembers from the old Superman movies. While we don't get any amazing lines like ""KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!"" We get a muddled CGI science fiction plot that was mixed with action scenes that overstayed their welcome. I'm going to say they should have made a live action version of the first three episodes from the Superman The animated series cartoons (seriously, go watch them!), because the technology reeked of a different villain. ""Nah! We'll just use Zod again. Everybody knows Zod. And I like redoing old movie stories. Nobody would would like Brainiac"" as told in my interpretation of David S. Groyer's mind.

The ""S"" stands for Sub-par.
There is no point in going into the full detail of the main actor's Superman because he's about as interesting as a painted brick. He's there to look shiny, but there is not real oomph to it. I have no idea where critics get the idea that the supporting cast was purely awesome.  Amy Adams became the weakest link in the whole bunch with Kevin Costner being bland as ever. No wait, Kal-El's mother was the bland 2 X 4 here. I'm assuming that Kyrptonioan physiology must be that different from humans, but come on! You just gave birth the kid with the imminent destruction of your home planet! I know I would be bawling my eyes out. I guess Russell Crowe's ""space ghost dad"" had some good moments. But because the bleakness of this film, it was hard for me to enjoy most of the acting performances presented. If there was any charm, wit, or humor, well, I certainly didn't notice that much. Like, why am suddenly supposed to care about Jimmy Olsen's replacement? Why am I more of perplexed instead of saddned of Pa Kent's random death? The only person here who knows to bring his ""A game"" to the table was Michael Shannon as Zod. If nothing else, watch it for him, and the commercial placement getting wrecked because they had more characteristics than the rest of the cast. Seiously, the movie should have been called ""Zod Breaks Steel.""

The ""S"" stands for Sort of?
So did I enjoy anything in this movie? Pretty much anytime the camera wasn't shaking or zooming in. Like the epic science fiction Kyrpton segments that showed scale of the Phantom Zone drive. There were scenery shots that reminded me of some of my favorite comic book moments. For example, when Superman finally reveals himself, that scene was something like reading Alex Ross's Kingdom Come. Hans Zimmer's score here is now one of my favorites of his. While there is no triumphant John Williams theme that can make adults and children hum at anytime, this score is full of emotions that makes you want fly or fight for humanity...you know while you destroy your beloved city in the process. When Superman and Zod finally fight just each other, I was actually entertained. I thought to myself, ""this right here is what I paid to see."" Hell, I wasn't even shocked by what Superman had to do at the end of the fight. I myself thought it was a justified action since this could be the lesson for Superman to learn. Then the ""I'm sorry sir, he's just SO hot"" dialogue part happens. BOOM! like an airplane crash, I immediately remembered everything of why I hated this film. Thank you so much Mr. Snyder and Groyer!

The ""S"" stands for Scared.
I am a huge DC comics nerd and I was hoping this movie was going to return some of that inner teen when I watched marathons of the Justice League from the still perfect DC Animated Universe. I was scared that with Snyder directing, because his 300 and Watchmen approaches were, although true to source material, his execution of it ended up as still meh. I understand that this is not the Superman I grew up with and the movie was striving to be something different. I'm open to revamps or reincarnations, but only when they are done right and it's enjoyable to watch as a whole. What we got was a movie that either pleases fans or non fans but also created a huge negative reception from fans and non fans. Usually you strive to please the most, not cause a huge rift between the two. I have no clue what Snyder's attempt was with direction this movie, but I have to assume that he thinks newer audiences always dig grittier things for heroes that usually aren't. Also we apparently have attention spans of fleas with these camera techniques used. The thing that hurts the most? This movie is now Warner Brothers and Legendary picture's template for the DC cinematic Universe, and that is a serious problem. See, the difference between this and Marvel's approach, was that Iron Man was enjoyable from the start and Robert Downey's acting enthusiasm that charms the audience right from the start! For DC, I'm scared of what the next set of movies are going to be like if this is what they base it off of.

I have to point out one final issue: Why was it called ""Man of Steel?"" Was it because it's a Superman movie and the title pertains to one of his many comic identities? At least in The Dark Knight we received Jim Gordon's message for the climax of the film to help personify why Batman is called this, or you know, they say the freaking title and it meant something! In this movie, we get nothing! I'm assuming it's titled that because Kal-El crashed through tons of steel then. I don't know, you tell me!

Well, for now, this ""S"" definitely stands for SUCKS."
1397,5.0,"I will admit, I had my doubts about another ""Superman"" movie.  Since the 2006 release of ""Superman Returns"", I was down on Superman.  I had trouble seeing how his story can make a comeback.  Marvel was taking all the fame and glory with ""Iron Man"", ""Hulk"", ""Thor"", ""Captain America"", and ultimately, ""The Avengers"".  Not to mention that the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"" had taken Batman's story to a whole new level.  I was worried that there was no room left or even a but least of chance for Man of Steel hero.  I really did, at first, believe that ""Man of Steel"" was going to fail.

But then I saw the movie in theaters and I was completely corrected by the amazingness of ""Man of Steel!  I was surprised that I actually started loving this movie when it first began!  The story, the acting, and the suspense had me looking on to see what happens next!  For once in my life, I was shocked and excited for this movie.

When I found out that the legendary, ""Christopher Nolan"" had written the story for the film, I was freaking out of my mind!  I knew that I recognized the beautiful development of the world and of the storyline as well.  Christopher Nolan was (and still is) my inspiration.  Since his work on the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"", I have used him as an inspiration.  And then we even have Zach Synder directing the movie too.  I love his work on ""300"" and ""Legend of the Guardians""!

We also have great actors who helped bring their characters to life.  Like Henry Cavill, who did an amazing job at portraying Superman and actually making us feel for him.  A man who is trying to discover who he is and where his place is in this world, while trying to stay hidden from a world that fears him.  Amy Adams's Lois Lane was one of the greatest acting characters I have ever seen!  She completely allowed us to see a ""real"" Lois inside of her and also bring out something new as well.  And we also have the legendary Russell Crowe, who finally brings us a ""badass"" Jor-El.  Russell allows us to see Mr. El in action and also allows us to actually like him and bring out a whole new personality of him too.  But then we have the villain, Zod!  Michael Shannon brings out his ""soldier"" acting and transforms it into something amazing with one of the greatest foes that Superman has ever faced!  We see his evilness and also his will to do what is necessary for the greater good.  He is what a good soldier really is about and Michael brings it to life for the first time.  Both Martha and Jonathan Kent are played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, who make everything about them from the comics come to life and show us how they really would be in a movie like this.  And finally, we have Laurence Fishburne, who gives us perhaps the greatest acting as Perry White since the original Superman films.  Not only do we see a familiar Perry White, but we also get to see a little bit of ""Morpheus"" inside his character.  Trust me when I say it, the acting is just amazing from every single actor and the people who chose them did very good!

The storyline of this movie was beautiful and it was so Christopher Nolan-style!  Everything was great in depth of every character, including moments as well.  Despite the lack of character-development, the story of this movie was amazing and it brought back Superman from the grave!  Christopher Nolan understands the world of these superheroes!

This is a movie that is totally worth buying!"
1398,2.0,"The genre of the ""hidden footage"" movies is done to death in my opinion tho a really good one is like striking gold on Amazon Prime these days. So I continue to try these film styles of Movies to hopefully find gold...this is NOT one of those. I really wanted to like this movie b/c I have heard of that ""Haunted"" house before. However at the beginning & ending we are shown something that may have happened there while this man is alone and according to a police radio we are told 3 ppl were found dead there. Then we are told we will see what leads up to this man's arrest at the very beginning...we see him going after a Cop with a hammer, no shirt on and blood on his body...
However the middle doesn't give us anything that would warrant this man's arrest. Instead we witness him freaking out (tho he is supposed to be a professional) at every bump and the lights keep going out. The film crew never came? Why? He continued to go out to a barn to put the circuit breaker back on and then he went back into the house, Why? IF he was so terrified (BTW his hand held camera must have a very good battery pack) why didn't he just stay out side? This was yet another Blair Witch hunt that could have been good IF they gave us more to go on as far as what happened to this now crazy man walking along the street...Don't bother looking nothing is ever shown to us as promised. I have no idea who died there but a woman does come in the a.m. and starts hearing the same noises...did he kill her? I DK...don't even bother with this one. It builds but doesn't deliver."
1399,2.0,"Gag.  I know, it's a cult ""classic"" and all that, but this movie was so freaking bad I couldn't handle watching another minute of it.  I can watch pretty much anything if I'm on the treadmill in a zone, but this was brutally dumb, low budget, and the stinker of the decade.  Maybe, just maybe if i was in college, drunk (or whatever), and it was combined with a drinking game.  Otherwise, no chance this will ever see daylight on my screen again."
1400,1.0,"After the first viewing I loved this documentary. It was amazingly well-crafted and a powerful EMOTIONAL story that brought me to tears.

But then I started THINKING and upon further reflection realized how dishonest the film was at its core.

The main character of this film was a dead person who couldn't speak for herself. She also happened to be the director's own mother who died when the director was 11 years old. As people tend to do, they romanticize the dead and forget all their flaws. In this movie we are manipulated into believing the mother was just a happy-go-lucky, full-of-life woman who was just looking to be loved. (By the way, all the ""home movies"" that showed this ""full-of-life"" woman were actually RECREATIONS using ACTORS.) But in reality, when you think of this woman's actual behavior you realize she was rather a self-absorbed, self-centered narcissist who cared first and foremost about her own happiness and physical pleasure.

For instance, we are told that the first man she married was too controlling and that she only married him because he was the type of guy she thought her parents would want her to marry. This marriage soon turned loveless and she began having an affair with an actor who she became smitten with after seeing him in a play. Because of her adultery, she lost custody of the kids to their father. Yet the director spends quite a bit of effort manipulating us into believing this was just so unfair to her mother. But had the father been the adulterer I don't think there would be much sympathy for him. And based on her future adulterous affairs it appears the judge got it right: this woman was more concerned about herself, her career, and her own needs than the needs of her children. In fact, her children are then abused by their stepmother and we're manipulated into feeling sorry for the MOTHER because it ""must have been hard for her not to be able to protect her children""?!?!? I guess she wasn't thinking much of her children when she was busy cheating on their father and what the consequences for THEM might be, right? RIGHT?????

Let's look at more of the evidence of what a wonderful woman she was....

She has more children with her next husband....the actor she cheated with during her first marriage. But he claims she was more in love with the CHARACTER he was playing than with the real him. He was the opposite of this character and so she again feels unfulfilled, moves away from the family to further her acting career, and has affairs with two other men. One of these affairs leads to a pregnancy. Does she stay with her new love? Nope. She goes back to her husband and then fools him into raising another man's child as his own thereby denying the child the right to know her real father and financially obligating her responsible husband for the care of another man's child. This child just so happens to be the director of this documentary.

All the interviews wax poetic about how this woman was just unfulfilled and looking for love and how glad they were that she was able to find a bit of that love before she died by having this adulterous affair. Of course, based on her past actions it's likely she would have gotten bored with this ""love"" too and would have eventually cheated on him as well had their relationship led to marriage. But of course we'll never know because she stayed with her husband and then died 11 years later.

We're told over and over how much of a victim this woman was when in fact, the truth seems just the opposite. It appears she was the VICTIMIZER and the men and children in her life were the ultimate victims. Was her first husband really too controlling or was he simply trying to have her live up to her responsibilities as a mother and wife and stop being a party girl? We never got his point of view so we'll never know the truth. If she wanted her freedom why didn't she just stay single and pursue her career? Why get a husband and children involved? That seems to have been HER choice. As was having an adulterous affair which caused her to lose custody of her kids. If her first husband was so horrible, she could have simply divorced him, gotten custody, and then started work on a new life. But she didn't. And for that she paid the same price a man would have paid had he been the adulterer in a divorce proceeding: she lost custody. Boo-hoo!

You would think after her first failed marriage she would try to get to know the next man a little better so she could avoid all the heartbreak for herself and MOST IMPORTANTLY for her children. But did she? Nope. She once again got all tingly when she saw this handsome actor and fell in love with the character he was playing and NOT the real man. Once again, she gets married to someone she doesn't really know, has kids with him, falls out of love with him and then has a couple of affairs, one of which leads to a pregnancy.

Does she own up to her mistake and either get an abortion or tell her husband the truth? Oh no...she lies and convinces him its his child. So the man of questionable character who has sex with another man's wife and doesn't even have the sense to wear a condom gets off scott-free from financially and emotionally supporting the life he helped create. And the responsible man who'd put his own dreams on hold in order to get a higher paying job in order to raise a family is the one who is duped into paying for another man's child.

And then once this child grows up the sperm donor father gets to waltz in and be the big hero for having loved her mother the way her father couldn't or wouldn't?!?!?! And now HE gets to have a relationship with a child he never made any effort in having a relationship with during her entire childhood....when diapers needed to be changed. When homework needed to be done. When clothes and cars needed to be paid for. When college needed to be paid for. Once all the REAL work has been done, the man who had no moral compass and had unprotected sex with another man's wife gets to be the freaking hero of the story???????????????

And to top it all off, the first thing all three of these people (the sperm donor, director daughter, & real father) think when the real truth comes out is: how can I profit from this by writing a book or a screenplay because it's ""such a good story""?!?!? Wow. Truly a family that deserves each other.

Yes, it's a great STORY. But that's all it is....a story. Like Lion King or Gladiator. It's not the truth and there's nothing to learn from it. It's just a story. A meaningless story."
1401,1.0,"Really no Uncut editions except the 1st one? REALLY? How many box sets and now much money are they going to scam fateful fans out of before they decide to do this series justice.

Now at least having Jason goes to hell uncut when the freaking download is uncut is just a slap in the face. That movie is much better uncut. Actually anything after the 4th one is bounds better uncut vs. the hack job the rating board put on them.

If I was in charge here's what i'd do.

- Have uncut unrated versions of all the films

- New remastered 4K transfer for ea film (ghostbusters had one, other older films as well)

- HD DTS track for every one

- Commentaries for ea. film

- actual 3D for the 3rd film to take advantage of new 3D tvs

- Include the new excellent documentary

- Non cardboard packaging

I mean seriously how freaking hard is that!!! Freddy also had a shameful boxset. Freddy built newline and they couldn't even show proper respect. Ugh.

Avoid until they respect fans and give us what we deserve instead of milking us."
1402,1.0,"I refused to watch the Lighting Thief when it came out in theaters because I knew they had changed so much stuff from the book.  It was the same with Sea of Monsters.  However, my father, who has never read the books, wanted to see both of them and so I ended up renting them for him to watch.  I get the fact that due to time constraints, things may need to be cut or slightly altered when making a book into a movie.  But, and this is a really big but, you don't rewrite 3000 years of Greek mythology just because you don't feel like properly following the plot of the book that you are making into a movie.  And that is just the beginning of the atrocities.

When the author of the highly popular, best selling, series offers to assist you on the script for the movie based on his book (as Riordan did with the Lighting Thief, he learned his lesson and did not offer again), you don't blow him off thinking that you know better.  These books have a built in fan base and altering the stories so much so you can sex things up (ahem, yes, I'm talking about Percy and Annabeth) and Hollywoodize the crap out of them to try and turn a profit, things are going to back fire.  Fans aren't stupid.  They know when things have been changed for the sake of earning a buck and it's a pretty poor buck you're trying to get them to spend.

If you haven't read the books, maybe you'll be fooled into liking this.  Even my father thought this one was a bit too over the top so I doubt I'll have to succumb to renting the next one (if this even did well enough overseas to warrant a third one) and I can save myself the torture of watching Hollywood rip apart one of my favorite series.

All I can say is the cursed blade isn't Percy's sword as Hollywood would have you believe.  The cused blade is the freaking pen that was used to sign off on this pile of crap.  *Climbs down off soap box in a huff*"
1403,5.0,"I was at Target and I saw the 3D Blu Ray ... hmmmmmm. I had enjoyed the first film altho it was no masterpiece, I've watched it a few times. but the cover of this one was so beautiful, gilded hologram that even though I had passed it up in the theaters, I was intrigued. I did a quick Google check and read that the film was decided to be developed with 3D projection in mind after the 3rd week of planning. The same conversion company was used that converted Titanic. That was enough to persuade me to buy and MAN am I glad I did. Definitely some of the best 3D conversion to date, along the lines of Avengers. Just stunning. I can see how others seeing this in 2D might think it was just okay, but on my plasma 3D screen, it is freaking heaven. The ending scenes with the Ark and Kronos ... wow. If you have a 3D TV or are planning on getting one (there are really some affordable ones out there), grab this 3D disc while you can, even if it's just for future viewing. Definitely worth it."
1404,2.0,"First sign this movie is going to be terrible... two guys go out to an old ruined home in the woods, one guy sees an old lady, the first guy  says, why are you freaking out about old ladies?  Second guy doesn't point out the fact that she doesn't exist?  lol... The writing is just that bad... and that's the very first scene, so I have my trusty popcorn and my kitty cat, but it looks like this one is going to be really bad.

I love horror films, paranormal films that take place in an asylum so I gave it a shot, I don't mind independent movies, amateur actors, if the story is really good.

I was interested in the story being told here, but the problems are many.

The script is not very well written, the scenes are poorly utilized, such as when a guy goes to see archives, he doesn't seem to find anything and the whole scene comes off as worthless, adding no depth or tension or reason to the film.

Something begins to happen but then just cuts and it's over and no one's that impressed or surprised, which makes no sense.

Poorly written characters throughout.

No one has any chemistry, the friendship, the girlfriend?  No one has any believable connection or emotion to the relationships they're supposed to be portraying... Laura Gilreath and Aaron Mathias do an alright job with the maddeningly bad script and direction.

I love when the half brother is giving Andy s*** about borrowing his boat, and then when we finally see the boat it's a pretty cheap boat with cheap plastic back yard chairs tied together.

There's some decent story twists that I enjoyed, such as Mary finding him and getting taken back to the hospital and Aaron pursuing, showing you the movie really could have been better if they had just kept the story more human and not tried to be so ""smart"" with the dialog that really hurt the film.

2/10"
1405,4.0,this movie tugged at my heart BIG time  i freaking LOVED IT. it was about time Odette and Derek had child. Alise is so adorable and beautiful; she made me shed a tear every time she was onscreen. i didn't mind the CG the story was dark and emotional. Skully was a great supporter and the Evil Force was really creepy despite not being a physical being like the past villains. anyway if there's a next time i hope Alise will have a bigger speaking role but for now I welcome Alise to this wonderful loving family
1406,5.0,OMG I love this movie jhonny deep is freaking hilarious. Over all is fantastic hope there is a sequel on this movie i am gonna be the first in line. Love this movie of all the movie I'd watch this year 2013 this is my number 1 in my list. I highly recommend this movie to everybody .
1407,4.0,"No matter what weird exercise phase I get into, I always, always go back to the TA Mat Workout. I heart that DVD so much. In light of that, I took one star off for Precision Toning b/c it is not as friendly to my bad wrists and knees (ie, I have to take breaks and/or modify) like the Mat video is.

In terms of clear direction, this DVD is amazing. I've never minded the lack of counting or direction in her other DVDs (exceptions: Teen Meta, which is pure torture, and Metamorphosis, which is also torture in a repetitive way--and therefore, I can't stick to it).

Also, for those who say this isn't a cardio DVD--well, ok, there is no dancing or running around, but holy crap, if you are ACTUALLY doing the exercises (not half-*ssing it, which is what I suspect a lot of complainers are doing, no offense), you will be gasping for breath by the time you get to the middle of the legs section. I was dripping sweat everywhere by this point (and also frequently cursing. The pain!!!). You will feel your heart racing for hours upon finishing.

This DVD is way harder than the Mat DVD (which I can actually get all the way through, in spite of being 15 lbs. overweight), which comparatively is like taking a 10 minute walk. It's been 2 days since I first did this workout and I am still walking bowlegged and jangly. My thighs are on freaking fire. I am going to try to get through it again tomorrow even though I'm practically tripping over myself from jangly-leg syndrome."
1408,5.0,"This movie is freaking awesome. I think of it as one of the good Batman movies taking place when Bruce is much older. Be so cool if it was cross reference with Terry, but I think Bruce wasn't old enough at the time for that to happen. Defiantly worth watching. Kind of thought it'd be 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but half of it is literally just bonus extras from the movie. I rented it on Amazon using video credits from my Prime shipping."
1409,5.0,"Just watch this last night, oh my god this was so freaking amazing!!! Oh man it was great to finally see the very first Batman comic I've ever read 20 years later be turned into a full-length two hour plus movie, just amazing! It's only problem I have for the movie, it didn't have any of the dialogue that Batman was saying to himself in the comic, other then that it was great!"
1410,5.0,GREAT movie!!  If you like suspense and being scared this is it!!  John Cusak is freaking scary!!  Nicolas Cage was his awesome good guy!  Great movie!
1411,5.0,"If you're looking for the perfect movie to spend about 2 hours watching with the love of your life eating popcorn and sour patch kids.  This is the movie for you.  Make a memory, share a laugh, get excited, be afraid.  All that is possible with this movie.  Just know that once that two hours is gone you're going to ask yourself two important questions.  1) What the hell did I just watch?  2) Is there more where that came from, because I need there to be more.
The answers to those questions are. 1) Does it really matter?  That was freaking awesome wasn't it? 2) Yes.  Try Kung Fu Hustle if you haven't already."
1412,1.0,"I have no freaking clue why so many people are praising this God awful Chucky sequel, none of it made any sense whatsoever, the writing sucked, the acting was horrible, the dialogue for Chucky was corny as hell, Charles Lee Ray's backstory was so incredibly stupid, this movie blew balls so much it's no even funny, they should have stopped making Chucky movies after Child's Play 3, Chucky rules but he sure as hell doesn't in this pile of disappointing crap, IT SUCKS!!"
1413,5.0,this 2 guys should franchise them self in to making at least 2 movies a year together for the next 10 years and tey will be the filthiest richest people in Hollywood they are freaking amazing and crazy.
1414,4.0,"I laughed like crazy at this movie. I thought it was freaking hilarious. I think a certain generation of googlers can't laugh at themselves. That's ok, I laughed hard with and at them :)"
1415,2.0,"""Dexter"" went from being one of the greatest shows on television to one of the worst. And it pains me to say this, but the series finale was quite possibly the worst in TV history. Seriously. The ""Seinfeld"" finale is golden compared to this one.

I feel that ""Dexter"" went steadily downhill after Season 4, which admittedly was so freaking fantastic that it would be next to impossible for anything else to measure up. However, Season 8 was by far the worst of all. The Dr. Vogel plot was weak and a terrible way to wrap up what was once a great series. Let's just get to the finale, which is the absolute worst thing about this season. (Warning: massive spoilers ahead.)

1. I had this feeling that Deb's character would meet an unfortunate end, but it really seemed unnecessary here. Does everyone in the show have to be miserable at the end?

2. Hannah is now raising Harrison in Argentina. Really? Would it have been so awful to have Dexter flee Miami and at least leave Harrison with Deb? (And, you know, keep Deb alive?) And how is Hannah raising Harrison a good idea? Need I remind everyone that she is a serial killer also? Maybe of a different breed than Dexter, but still. What about his grandparents, Rita's parents? Dexter never thought that Harrison might be better off in the care of his family and siblings? And isn't anyone going to wonder what happened to Harrison after Dexter is declared dead? No one will think he was out on that boat. Dexter never would have taken Harrison out in a hurricane. Hmm.

3. I don't think Deb ever fully resolved her ""I am in love with my brother"" issues. They were revealed at the end of Season 6, and then it's like the writers went, ""Yeah, that was weird. Let's just not talk about it and pretend it never happened.""

4. The whole Dexter dumping Deb's body in the water was odd to say the least. I kept waiting for Harry's apparition to return and say something like, ""I know you don't need me anymore, Dexter, but I'm back to tell you that even I don't know what the heck you're trying to do right now!""

5. I was so sure that the finale would wrap up with Matthews letting Dexter off the hook somehow, and with Dexter learning that Matthews was somehow in on everything via Harry from the very beginning. The show even set it up to be that way over the past couple of seasons, but then nothing happened with that at all. Same with all the other supporting characters. I get that the show was mainly about Dexter, but the audience received zero closure on everything else.

6. That final scene...you know, the one where Dexter is now Wolverine?! I guess I understand the self-imposed exile, after what happened to Deb. However, the last few episodes leading up to the finale were all about Dexter remarking on how he didn't even really have the urge to kill anymore, and he just wanted to spend time with his new family and build a life with them. I don't understand how all that vanished after Deb, and how abandoning his son seemed like the only way to go.

So there you have it. I am still reeling after watching the finale and am super bummed. I feel like the producers really let the audience down. Dexter himself let me down, too. He just kind of threw in the towel at the end. So un-Dexterlike, and not at all what his sister Deb would have wanted."
1416,5.0,"Lord of the Rings for grownups. Brilliant writing, casting, cinematography, costumes, set design, special effects and acting. Totally immersive. Some of the best written dialogue -- much of it witty and laugh-out-loud funny -- ever to appear on any screen of whatever size. Shot with the verve and scale of a Hollywood Technicolor movie of old. A lot of swordplay, grizzly deaths, bloodshed and sex. But all of it excellently choreographed and photographed, with much of the action being unexpected and engrossing. G.O.T. is a fully realized alternate time, place and world. And it has lots of smart things to say about power, politics, ambition, the human heart and the human species capacity for both cruelty and nobility. Also, the supernatural creatures (White Walkers, e.g.) are vivid and realistic, and the dragons, onscreen neither too much nor too little, are freaking awesome!"
1417,4.0,"Other reviews will tell you more about the plot of ""Gravity,"" a story about two astronauts, avuncular veteran Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and nervous rookie Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who get lost in space. I am not qualified to talk about the technical stuff and won't try. I'm also not a science fiction fan: I've never seen ""2001"" and if I saw ""Alien,"" I've forgotten it, which I mention only because so many other reviewers are comparing ""Gravity"" to those films. We saw ""Gravity"" because Alfonso Cuaron directed it, and he made ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" the least popular but our family's favorite film in that series.

Everything you've heard about the physical beauty of this movie is true. The dialogue won't win any awards for originality. The characterizations are thin. I suspect that's intentional. By giving us cipher characters and words we are expecting amidst the stunning action set pieces and carefully chosen visual triggers (a fork, an icon of St. Christopher carrying the infant Jesus across the water, a Buddha), Cuaron makes it easy for the audience, male and female, to project ourselves into the situations and ask ourselves the movie's questions:

What does an individual life mean?
Why would anyone want to live?
Is there independent value in human life, or is it just evolutionary imperative?
Can we be saved, or must we save ourselves?
Does God exist?
If God exists, is a personal God with us, or is God simply a causation that leaves us alone in the universe?

Some reviewers have complained that the panicky Ryan Stone character is annoying. You could say that, but I think it shows a startling lack of empathy and an obsession with the technical question of whether NASA would really send someone of that disposition into space that disregards the movie's themes. What should have been a routine trip for someone who is not an astronaut by trade has turned into the equivalent of telling a first-time boater that they're going rowing on a calm shallow lake and then tossing them into a raging hurricane on the open ocean. It's a metaphor for what happened to Dr. Stone back home: she sent her four-year-old daughter to preschool and the child died playing tag. Events of what should have been an ordinary day call into question everything Dr. Stone knows and feels about why she lives and why she would want to live. I'd  be freaking out and I bet you would too. I've never had much use for Sandra Bullock, but her performance in ""Gravity"" won me over.

PARENT NOTE: The movie has some swearing and scary images. Our ten-year-old found the movie both interesting and frightening."
1418,3.0,"Not at all a sequel, rather this reimagining relies on our love of the original Fright Night (1985) while offering a new perspective to our vamps origins.  Not very good, but moderately entertaining.

Director Eduardo Rodriguez (Stash House, El Gringo) does not get off to a promising start.  After a very direct-to-video opening vampire sequence, we meet a class of college students studying abroad in Romania.  Among them are Charley Brewster (Will Payne), his ex-girlfriend Amy (Sacha Parkinson), and his rude friend Evil Ed (Chris Waller; The Sleeping Room, Inbred).

If, at this point, you feel a glimmer of hope that this will continue the story of 2011s Fright Night, youd be wrong.  This is not Charleys continued story after surviving 2011s undead events in Las Vegas.  These are totally unrelated characters of the same names or, in alternate perspective, they are the same characters in a different universe reliving a similar chain of events as our much better casts did in 1985, 1988 and 2011.  In other words, this is really in no way a sequel.  More a reimagining.  And, as such, a most unwowing Peter Vincent (Sean Power) now hosts a reality Monster Hunters TV show and Gerri Dandridge (Jaime Murray; Dexter, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena) is a female Romanian professor of European Art History who engages in lesbian vampire sex scenes that feel more gratuitous than in the sexual spirit of vampirism.

This movie echoes some of the iconic scenes of the original Fright Night (1985)e.g., Charleys neighborly voyeurism and Eds encounters with the main characters. Our Gerri, much as 1985s Chris Sarandon, also takes every opportunity to let Charley livealthough I cant surmise why until it is blatantly explained to Amy (and the audience) in the form of some needlessly elaborate vampire blood prophecy malarkey shoehorned through the characters mouths.  And speaking of malarkey, blood and boobs is the name of the game here. There are silly over-dramatizations, drippy baths of blood, a heavy dose of gratuitous nudity, some messy blood spurts, nonsensically long strip club scenes, a montage of Charley freaking out, and a vampire battle royale as our prophecy unfolds before our lobotomized eyes.

We learn that Bram Stokers Dracula was a mix of Elizabeth Bathory and Vlad the Impaler.  Gerris play on Bathory was obviously nothing to the historic The Countess (2009)which was much classier than the blood-soaked boobs of this non-sequelbut Gerri (and Jaime Murrays performance) remains the best aspect of this movie.  The coolest parts involved her abilities to shadow walk (as in Subspecies and Bram Stokers Dracula) and using her bat affinity for sonar (which I don't even think Ive seen in a vampire movie before).  She looked sleek and sexy and, not that its a bad thing, but her vamp style reminded of 30 Days of Night (2007) or Blade (1998). The most redeeming scene (in its entirety) of the film was actually its comic-style animation flashback explaining her origins.

Most other critical elements failed.  All dialogue in Evil Eds scenes were bad, the action largely sucked (and I don't know why there were so many fight scenes), the CGI was obvious (an intestinal explosion and a gooey melting scene), Eds fake fangs were so bulky it muffled his speech, and the gore make-up (an eye gauge and Evil Eds melted pizza face) was really just so-so most of the time.  I guess they triedit just wasn't really enough for me.  Although Gerris final transformation was moderately entertainingand, for some reason, the latex monster had demon boobs!  Like an alien demon beast (that could have been from any random movie) with no clothesand boobs!  Whats with this movie and boobs?  LOL.

This movie had so much nudity (for a sequel to a mainstream movie, anyway), its trailer should have just been blood-speckled boobs and Gerri being a sleek badass.  This non-sequel is dumb. The premise was wasted on this reimagining and should have been used for a more serious standalone vampire film rather than a direct-to-video sequel (that really isn't a sequel) of a remake.  And while a few scenes and depictions actually had some heart, they were surrounded by so much drivel they were easily forgotten in the wake of eye-rolling stupidity.

But, hey. Loads of boobs, blood and badness mean that you could make a solid Bad Movie Tuesday evening with your friends. To be fair, knowing this movie is awful is the best way to enjoy it."
1419,4.0,"Well 3.5 out of 5 I would give this blu-ray.  The show is great, the set list is awesome but finding the songs outside of Hysteria is a bit of a pain.  If you are looking for tracks 15+, you have to go into the extras and look for the Ded Flatbird night 1 and 2, it's a little odd how they did that.

So for the show this gets a 5/5 but the audio it gets a 2/5.  The Audio shows up as HD Master Audio sounds awful.  I had to turn my sub off so I could stand listening.  When you switch to the other sound option it's on standard stereo sound.  They could have done a much better job with the audio.  Like come on, it's a bluray disc!!!

Overall, this is a great show.  The crowd is a little lifeless at times and Joe's voice isn't always that good but this is freaking Def Leppard!  Gotta love it."
1420,1.0,"The least they could do is leave an empty slot for the upcoming film. It's 9 months away and they're trying to sell us some lame collection. Why is the collection lame? Because it comes with Wolverines freaking hand and claws...cool. Could have been literally anything else. Magnetos helmet? Xaviers school? A Brian Cox bust? Nope. They cut off Logans hand and stuck it on some crappy box.

Even worse than leaving out the sequel to first class is the fact that they are forcing you to buy Xmen 3 and Origins."
1421,5.0,I freaking love this movie!
1422,4.0,"Now by contrast, BIG ASS SPIDER! is how you do a comedy monster movie!! Starring Greg Grunberg and Lombardo Boyar (who is freaking brilliant, and funny as hell, in this film), the story is simple: an alien species the government has been studying, for possible future use as a weapon, gets away and runs amok in Los Angeles. A normal-sized spider that grows massively huge the more it kills, the arachnid - while still small - comes under the watchful gaze of Alex Mathis (Grunberg), an exterminator specializing in the habits and toxicology of arachnids, who tries killing it before realizing just what he has on its hands. But soon is becomes so huge, so unstoppable, that even when a crack military team sent by the U.S. government can't stop it, it falls to Alex and a security guard named Jose (Boyar) to save downtown Los Angeles. This film is HILARIOUS, nearly every line that comes out of Boyar's mouth alone a gem, and with perfect grade-B special effects and just the right amount of blood and gore, BIG ASS SPIDER! is one of the best ways to laugh and jump scare through a couple of hours that I've come across in a long time."

1424,5.0,"freaking funny, malkovich is a crackup."
1425,1.0,"Wow. Just reading the reviews I already know I don't want to watch this movie.  The first three reviews are people bragging that ""they understand the mathematical concepts of this movie"" due to their degrees. Sheesh. Blah. No freaking way. Boo. Bull."
1426,2.0,"couldnt get past the girls freaking out in typical girl fashion, pisses me off. the commercials really captured the best parts TT.TT"
1427,2.0,"Emile Hirsch, what happened to you?  You're playing a douchy wannabe software entrepreneur whose best lines involve flirting with a flight attendant over airplane-cell phone propaganda.  We're only a few minutes into this movie and I already finding myself disliking your protagonist.  I've seen you quiet and soulful in Into the Wild (2007), humorously innocent in the amazing The Girl Next Door (2004), credibly authoritative in Alpha Dog (2006)...and now this?  Did you lose a bet or just piss off one too many directors with vegan, gluten-free, organic catering demands?  Simply accepting this role and this script was a failure before the cameras even started rolling.  We'll call this strike one.

Anyway, this software designer and his partner are on a business trip to Moscow to market a social networking app for navigating the club circuit in any major city in the world.  [Why did they need to go to Moscow for this?  Because it was cheaper to film the movie there.]  Hirsch plays the more laid back, carefree partner who is always telling his business-oriented friend to relax.  Not even ten minutes into this flick they are double-crossed by a third party and ousted out of their own deal.  This really deviates from the standard formula.  The Hostel series, The Chernobyl Diaries, Wrong Turn, Wolf Creek and The Cabin in the Woods rely more simply on a group of friends going on a vacation.  It's simple but it works.  You never find yourself saying ""what's the point in them being in Moscow for this business deal"" and the movie's credibility is maintained until the real fun starts when the players begin to drop one by one to whatever the random malevolent force the writers dreamed up.  That's strike two.

So our boys go out clubbing to drink away their failed business venture and meet up with two cuties.  They seem to get along when suddenly there's a world-scale power outage and countless energy-based life forms fall from the sky like snow-flaky embers aglow with Tinkerbell's fairy dust.  They start incinerating people like vampires to Blade's silver katana, people start running and screaming, and we're only fifteen minutes into the movie.  Well, at least we didn't have to suffer through the business deal plot any more.

As people scream and turn into aerosol compost our heroes, now numbering five with the addition of the shark who screwed them over on their app idea,  hide in a restaurant store room. A week after the invisible, incinerating invasion began, they emerge to go to the US Embassy...because they wouldn't have been charred, right?  Oh, and the slick douchebag has turned into an annoying high strung coward.  Those characters are so annoying and they never get killed off as fast as you'd like.

The streets of Moscow have turned into an I Am Legend, soulless dust bowl of abandoned cars and ghostly edifices.  Hirsch leads the way as they remain ever vigilant.  Because these energy-based aliens activate electronic devices (i.e., lights) when they are present, our heroes learn to travel when it's safest: night.

At one point Hirsch avoids detection by standing perfectly still as the creature just strolled by unaware on the other side of a window.  Considering that these things see lifeforms like glowing fireballs of infrared, making them extremely obvious, I think that moment of idiocy makes for strike three.  They can't see through glass or metal cages?  Whatever!  Now I have to watch these idiots walking around like glass shield-bearing knights.  Just stupid!
Along the way their group grows by two, one of which is an annoying Russian girl with such memorable lines as ""It's okay, I'm tough"" and ""I am not a kid!""  Barf!  I hope she dies next.  But luckily the other addition, a wacked out electrician, invented a Ghostbusters microwave gun to combat our electric invaders.

I guess the effects were tolerable.  But how many times can you entertain me with people getting jerked into the air for a second and then getting turned to spiraling cinders by some invisible dust devil alien?  They shatter glass and detonate doors--boring.  After they disintegrated the first few people and a dog the kills got boring.  Our heroes start freaking out every time a breeze kicks up some debris and then the ""dumb"" really hits the fan.  They meet dumber tough-talking characters who fight the aliens in dumb ways wearing dumb outfits amid ridiculously dumb scenarios and give dumb speeches about preserving every human life they can.  Just truckloads and truckloads of dumb!  Oh, and eventually you get to see these aliens and, you guessed it, they look dumb!  The worst effects in the movie were dedicated to showing us what the aliens truly look like without their invisibility shield--they look like some weird floating head monster from Doom.  It's most upsettingly dumb when Hirsch kills an alien by throwing a charred piece of another dead alien at it.  One throw?  Really?  Climax-fail!  Sorry, we're out of strikes.

In the end I wished everyone died.  The quality of this movie actually decreased as the running time wore on and, accordingly, I turned on the characters more and more with every passing scene.  I won't say skip this movie.  But if you choose to watch it, watch and mock it with friends."

1429,2.0,"Warning: possible spoilers!

Underwhelming English language thriller by the director of the original Spanish language version of We Are What We Are--although to be fair the problems are more with the writing than direction.  The story concerns a teen named Hazel (Bella Thorne--perhaps too healthy looking for a girl who hasn't left her room for two months) who suffers from a severe panic disorder that includes agoraphobia and OCD.  Her indulgent and loving mom Dee (Kyra Sedgwick--weirdly trailer trash for a woman with a rich ex-husband although that and the apparently modest house they live in seem to be hard-to-swallow writing choices made to set-up a later plot twist--at this point we don't know ex-hubby is super rich) is being forced by her ex to put Hazel in a special treatment center in the desert so arrangements have been made to transport her under special conditions--in an enclosed compartment in the back of a van that will give her a small space separated from everyone else so she won't be hit by distractions that might trigger panic attacks or her agoraphobia.

Since Hazel is freaking out about getting in the van mom Hazel decides to come along for the ride to the institution as well.  The driver picks up three more passengers but before we get to know much about them the van is stopped in a nicely disorienting scene that seems to Hazel at first to be an accident but it isn't.  Everyone visible in the van is shot except for the girl who had been picked up a few minutes earlier--she is grabbed and thrown in the back of a vehicle which speeds away.

Hazel is afraid her mom is dead and crawls out of her hiding place--it turns out mom isn't dead but she's shot and bleeding and in a lot of pain.  Panic Disorder riddled Hazel decides she can walk 5 miles through the desert to a reservation to get help for her mom since she will die without medical attention, the van isn't drive-able and all the phones were taken.

Big Sky doesn't do a very good job of putting us inside the mind of Hazel and helping us understand how she feels with her terror of the world so her trying to walk through the desert for much of the movie is even less exciting than it sounds.  The other story strand involved the kidnappers Jesse (Frank Grillo who was better in Purge 2) and his brain addled little brother Pru (Aaron Tveit in the film's most effective performance) who never should have been given live bullets, let alone a gun.  He's the one who shot everyone even though that was never actually part of the plan.  Jesse has a nagging feeling that something went wrong besides the dead bodies--the right number of people were in the van and they were the right sexes but why would their target, an agoraphobic girl with a rich dad be sitting in the front of the van?

Bella Thorne is a lovely young actress and her character Hazel is someone you really do want to root for but the movie never figures out how to generate any suspense from her attempted trek 5 miles across the desert to find help from her mom.  The more conventional kidnappers element draws whatever little suspense it manages out of the unpredictable behavior of crazier than his older brother will admit Pru, but it takes them way too long to figure out they grabbed the wrong girl and even after they do the movie doesn't pick up much urgency.

Big Sky has unusually good intentions for a thriller and a mostly fine cast but it's never actually very thrilling or smart--leaving another wounded survivor for Kyra Sedgwick's Dee to interact with might have been a good idea.  Having something actually go wrong during the kidnapping that resulted in all the shooting might have also been a good idea.  You never get much of a sense that either of the kidnappers know what they are doing and incompetent criminals rarely make for interesting film characters.  Wandering through the desert also rarely makes for exciting cinema and Big Sky only manages to prove that point once again.  If the film had done a better job of dramatizing how Hazel experienced the world and why everything was so terrifying for her maybe some of that terror would have transferred to the audience but Big Sky never comes close to pulling that off.  In the end Big Sky is nicely filmed and well-cast but mostly pretty dull."
1430,1.0,"This is only the second movie in my 52 years I've walked out on, and that was because my 11 year old son said he was bored. The simple fact is, so was I, so we left. We walked. On a $50 freaking movie bill, we walked.

I wanted to give it another chance, but, guess what, it is still dull and boring. I've forced my way through 40 minutes, and just can't handle watching more. The characters, we don't care about. The situations, overdone. In fact, my feeling is, they were trying just too hard . They had some awfully big shoes to fill, and they were just trying too hard to do it. The pacing was just way too slow, but more than that I just couldn't really empathize with the characters. When you care about the characters, the pacing takes a back seat. It just seemed to go on and on about how magic stuff works -- but we already knew that. It needed to not be some kind of thing that needed to be emphasized, a focus on character and faster pacing would have helped. I mean, for one example, is it really necessary to show dishes flying into place on a table? In a rather prolonged sequence? Haven't we all seen this before? Show it happening, sure... 10 seconds worth would be enough though. Maybe the muggle, or ""nomag"" or whatever, was awed by it -- I wasn't. And even that guy, good grief, just seemed to accept it all without questioning. I mean, OK. Just a few minutes later, your roommate for the night jumps down a bag. Do you wonder what the Hell is going on? No, obviously, you just follow him down. And get a ""joke"", and a poor one, in about his girth. Didn't fat jokes go out of style some time ago? Or does that only apply to women?

I think the main problem is that the main protagonists are way, way too passive. Newt is passive to the point of almost apathy. That could be played on as a man out of his own element (England v. US), but it never really was. Even the main lady just takes a load of crap, never even expresses how that makes her feel... if this is all leading up to some sort of boiling point, I'm sorry; the writers screwed up. You don't make your audience wait through an hour or more of BS to get there. And again, Newt is so passive as to be unlikable; not good. Or for at least the first 40 minutes, the ""star"" kind of just gets led around by others, not really doing a damn thing. Is that really how Englishmen are? I've met a few. Not in my experience. In fact, Englishmen are very direct, in most cases, where us yanks would not be. This stereotype of the ""proper English Gentleman"" can be taken just so far before it becomes tedious -- unless you're playing it for laughs (Monty Python anyone?). Real people are not like that, even in England. Or at least, I certainly hope not and believe not. And for heaven's sakes, this was mainly made by Englishmen.

All in all, I just simply can't recommend this. I am truly, truly sorry. I very much wanted this to be ""the new Harry Potter"". It just isn't, plain and simple. I didn't want it to be like this, it's just how it turned out. Attack me if you must, but I do ask that any response be reasonable and salient and address the basic issues. I don't need, and won't respond, to personal attacks."
1431,5.0,"...and if you like high body counts, gruesome and violent deaths handed out to despicable characters, and generalized high-octane mayhem, this is a great film. Sometimes I'm in the mood for something violent, but I often get too involved with the lead characters, worrying about the next bad thing that's going to happen, getting all tense, and end up not enjoying the show (I had to stop Reservoir Dogs about twenty times and come back to it to finish it. Breaking Bad? Had to quit watching it entirely).

Enter likable, non-meathead Badass Bryan Mills (caveat: I gotta say that if he were played by, say, Vin Diesel or some other muscled-up dude, I would have hated him and given this zero stars). I love not having to worry about Bryan Mills, as he is indestructible and unstoppable, a professional in a world of amateurs, dealing death with abandon and in some cases glee. He is three steps ahead of everyone at all times and is an absolute expert at freaking everything from fisticuffs to high-performance driving to torture to administering intravenous drugs. He will humiliate and beat, pistol-whip, shoot, stab, maim, or otherwise incapacitate everyone foolish enough to stand in his path. Even while handcuffed to an overhead pipe and being garroted, you know those six thugs trying to finish him off have seconds to live and it's just damn beautiful.

No, it's not realistic in any way, shape, or form--I mean, really, how many crimes (murders!) did he commit in 72 hours while still getting out of France with nary a gendarme to be seen?-- but for pure testosterone-fueled bullet-ridden ass-kicking turn-off-your-brain, bad-guys-get-what's-coming-to-'em fun, Taken is nearly as good as the last three 007 films. Loved it."
1432,5.0,"MH MH has been THE most neglected classic of the television era.....a brilliant series that burned brightly for such a short time.  Before the days of a VCR, I actually FILMED the final episode on July 1, 1977 with a 8mm movie camera, anchored on a tripod, using seven 200 second film cartridges.  I was 17 years old and that cost me something like $50 to preserve one episode.  Now for $230 I can own all 325 episodes.  Isn't life great?  I think first time viewers are going to be AMAZED at how good this show is.  Can anyone believe that they produced each episode in only one day?  The actors were freaking brilliant---every one of them.  And the writing was so sharp.  I think I am going to watch one episode per day, starting on January 5, 2014 and watch them in order exactly 38 years after their original airings.  I want to SAVOR this."
1433,5.0,I love this series is freaking awesome
1434,3.0,"There is a line of dialogue spoken in the last half of this year's GODZILLA that encapsulates the film so well it must be cosmic karma. The line is spoken by David Strathairn, who grimly inquires of his aides, ""Where is Godzilla?"". This sums up perfectly the flaws of Gareth Edwards' otherwise rather breath-taking monster movie. The movie is _called_ Godzilla. The trailers _showed_ Godzilla. We came to _see_ Godzilla. So where in the heck IS Godzilla? So, before we embark on my review on Godzilla, let me remind you that this is just my subjective opinion on the movie, and I'll try not to lose you, because this could get really deep.

First off, the saddest part is that Godzilla could have been so much greater. The trailers certainly showed us the potential (Godzilla, in my opinion, had one of the best marketing campaigns in recent memory). Here was a chance to make a movie that was epic, awe-inspiring and fast-paced, packed with action, humor and the kind of insanity you'd expect from a movie about a 400-foot monster with radioactive breath, fighting other monsters that look like the lovechild of H.R. Giger, a cobra and a butterfly. Instead we get a long movie (that feels much longer) saturated with a thick sense of doom, a convoluted plot that moves at a glacial pace, a collection of dour performances, a sprinkle of jaw-dropping fight scenes and apocalyptic imagery, and a little something thrown in on the side about...scientific hubris? nature out of whack? And all the while things are missing: a sense of fun and adventure, action, and namely, Godzilla.

Let's start with the plot. The way I remember it, GODZILLA is about these evil, flying MUTO's that Godzilla has to fight. Everything else, from the romantic subplot to the military subplot, to the symbolism to the setting to the ridiculous leaps of the imagination that are asked of the viewers is utterly secondary. The film moves at the pace of a lumbering behemoth, as characters go places, talk about things, and make you wonder why they're in the film at all. On the side, there is some action thrown in there. And you'll be happy when it comes, because it is utterly awesome, in the truest sense of the word. More on that later.

Let's talk a little about the acting. Consider last year's monster movie: Pacific Rim. A sincere and often goofy ode to kaiju, in every frame of the movie, every actor and every crewman is having fun. Characters have names like Hannibal Chau and Newton Geiszler. Godzilla has characters with names like Joe Brody and Ford Brody. Everybody plays their roles with grim faces and serious intonations. The only one having fun is Bryan Cranston, who chews the scenery with relish and gets all the best lines. The humans are utterly secondary to the monsters, and some of them have little to no impact on the plot at all. I'm certain there's at least one scientist or soldier who did zilch to advance the plot.

Now, I'm perfectly happy to not see the monster for a while, a la Jaws. We don't fully see the T-Rex or King Kong until almost 45 minutes into their movies, and we feel satisfied. But it works because in the meantime we're spending time with interesting and cool human characters like Alan Grant and Carl Denham. In Godzilla, talented actors like Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, and David Strathairn play cookie-cutter, thick, white bread characters that interest nobody. You'll be aching to see more than the monster equivalent of a little ankle. But maybe all of this works out in the end. Because when Godzilla goes the full monty, we are so pumped.

And that's where Godzilla gets good. That's why you should see the movie. Because when director Gareth Edwards finally gets room to gallop, he freaking gallops. The man has an eye for a stunning image, and he scatters the movie with the kind of jaw-dropping, terrifying, beautiful imagery you expected from the trailer. An abandoned city, given over to nature; a giant kaiju wreathed in smoke; trails of red smoke over a fiery San Francisco, the sheer bulk and might of Godzilla unleashed in the moonlight...these are images that will stay with me. Speaking of our titular character, when he DOES show up, he's unbelievably impressive. Edwards and the visual effects department have conjured up what might just be the best-looking Godzilla yet. They've captured a creature of immense bulk and weight and size, a force of nature...an ""alpha predator"" that makes the might of Uncle Sam's war machine look like ants carrying little sticks. His foes - the MUTO's, look equally impressive: a vaguely Giger-esque cross between a butterfly, praying mantis, cobra, and bat. They have glowing red eyes and crooked limbs and they fly like your worst nightmare. When these kaiju fight, they fight! The battle between Godzilla and the MUTO's is a hugely impressive action scene. It has weight and gravitas - this ain't the flashy glitz of Transformers or Marvel - this is big, scary, epic warfare that will leave you in awe. I wish we saw more of Godzilla, and less of...Ford Brody.

In conclusion, Godzilla does have some amazing action scenes and is visually stunning. When Godzilla is on the screen, the movie inspires awe and wonder. When he's off - and unfortunately that's for a major portion of the screentime, the film collapses under the weight of its dense, slow-moving plot, cookie cutter characters, and lack of action. But while Godzilla has its impact lessened, it is by no means a film you should avoid. I recommend the movie as a collection of unforgettable and gorgeous images and action scenes, separated by dense filler. If this Godzilla isn't the King of the Monsters, he's at least an Archduke. Maybe a Count. Or a Prince Regent.
Godzilla, Prince Regent of the Monsters, gets 3 stars from me.

1436,5.0,"Action! Celebrities! Great story! Suspense! Monsters! Definitely a Summer hit! I loved this movie! I highly recommend buying or seeing it! I also liked the Matthew Broderick version. I watched the original Japanese version in preparation for this newest one, and that was interesting, cool to compare all 3 versions. This newest one is my favorite though, for a few reasons:
1) Bryan Cranston blew us away with Breaking Bad. It was great to see him back and on the big screen. His acting was phenomenal and really brought drama and suspense to the film. He made it all seem very real and very serious.
2) The monster was great-looking! The CG was superb. He was the perfect size and believable. He was relatable too, you wanted to fear him, but you were also cheering for him. Between the tension and the heart-warming feelings that the film makers were conjuring from the audience, it was an emotional rollercoaster!
3) The film was not too long to bore you, and not too short to leave u wanting more. It had a great, comprehensive story. I left the theater feeling elated and satisfied and I cannot say that about the past few movies I've seen this year.
4) The Skydiving scene was amazing. Period. Gave me chills. I'll leave it at that, hopefully I didn't ""spoiler"" anything.

I usually can't find many movies where I'm like, ""That was freaking great!"" And I wasn't necessarily a fan of Godzilla-related things, but this movie changed all that. I even bought a mini figure of him (""Running Press Godzilla with Light and Sound"" - see my review!), just because it was THAT awesome! So yes, definitely buy, rent...just SEE this movie, it's a must and you will NOT be disappointed!"
1437,5.0,"Awesome is the best word to describe this movie, its one of those movies that you just have to sit back and think wow is this really happening? If you thought pacific Rim was an epic monster film then you will ease into this no problem, firstly Godzilla the king of monsters looks freaking amazing, one of the coolest movie monsters ever for me, his screen presence is epic, the story starts a tad slow but that's only to build up the story and we get into the characters and understand how this epic clash of titans begins, great cast overall, amazing soundtrack that really thumps in all the right places, especially during the epic monster scenes, as for the effects they are flawless, top notch visuals and stunning CGI effects that bring these monsters to look so real, the second half of the movie is so much fun, you just cant wait for next big epic scene with the monsters, this truly for me is the best film so far of 2014 by miles, it is so much better than I hoped, thumbs up to the director for making a faithful Godzilla movie and just an outright damn fun epic monster movie that flattens all others!! couldn't recommend it enough, if you know you like these kind of films then see it, worth every penny."
1438,1.0,"WARNING, this review is chock full of spoilers. Im not even going to try to hide them. Im here to explain why I hate Godzilla 2014, and Im going to do that in as much detail as I possibly can, so if you don't want this movie spoiled for you then by all means DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW. Thank you.

1. They kill their best actor in the first twenty minutes.

If you watched the trailers for Godzilla 2014, you probably thought that Bryan Cranston, who will from now on be known as Heisenberg (for reasons you should already know) has a prominent role to play in this movie. He's in about half of the trailer after all. I was under the impression that Heisenberg was the hero of this story (along with Godzilla of course). How could I not? Not only is he the human face of this movie, but he's far and away the best actor in it. Lies. All lies. Heisenberg is reduced to nothing more than a glorified cameo. For twenty minutes this movie had heart. It had character. It had the feels, and that's all because it had one of the best actors of the modern day in the lead role. Heisenberg was brilliant. He was literally the ONLY thing about this movie that I liked. His chemistry with Juliette Biniche, who plays his wife for a brief time, was great, and as we knew from the trailers his monologue when confronting the authorities was epic. But then they decided to kill him off, and I'm scratching my head wondering why. Its not like he NEEDED to die or anything to move the story forward. No, he needed to NOT die. It seemed to me that the whole movie got derailed the minute he left the screen. Sure it was no masterpiece even with him in it, but he's the only person in this film who either didn't overact, or stare blankly at the screen in an unemotional state for two hours. Why kill your best actor in the first twenty minutes? Especially when Kick Ass ends up being the one to replace him. The world may never know.

2. They don't do Godzilla justice.

I'm going to call it as I see it guys, Godzilla is a big fat fatty. I'm sorry if this seems nit-picky but I HATED Godzilla's look. Don't get me wrong, its not like I'm calling for a return to the chicken legged T-Rex of the 90's Godzilla, but it would have been nice if they just took the Menelial Godzilla from the Toho franchise and gave him a CGI update. I appreciate that they at least tried to stay close to the look of the original and didn't go full retard on us like they did in the 90's, but I'm sorry, they failed. Godzilla's head is too small, his body too fat, he looks more like my sister in laws retarded pug then the king of the monsters. A guy in a suit is more menacing then this monstrosity. I didn't even think they did his atomic breath right. Again, forgive me for being nit-picky, but its nowhere near the awe inspiring force of destruction it is in the Toho films. But none of that compares to the travesty of being regulated to a secondary character in his own movie. He got no origins story, no explanation as to why he suddenly appeared, or why he wants to fight the giant horny bug Pokmon (more on that later), he just sort of shows up for a little bit, fights, and then leaves. Instead of a movie about an unstoppable force of nature wreaking havoc on the world and threatening us with extinction LIKE THE TRAILER MADE US THINK, we get a movie about bug monsters that just so happens to have Godzilla in it. Why do THEY get an origins story and Godzilla does not? This isn't called ""attack of the horny bug monsters"" its called Godzilla damn it!

3. The human characters suck.

Except for Heisenberg, there is not a single character I cared for. Kick Ass isn't a terrible actor, but in this film he has the range of a baked potato. He shows little to no emotion throughout, seems to forget all about his family until its convenient for the plot for him to remember them, and shows a super human ability to survive everything from falling of gigantic bridges to monsters chasing him through the streets. Seriously, he shows the emotional range of a donkey. Someone describe his character for me please, because generic military guy is about all I got. Because yeah, everyone knows that guys in the military all stoic don't give a crap about anything people.  And THIS is who they get to pick up where Heisenberg left off? No. No no NO! He just couldn't do it. He plays Lieutenant Ford Brody, and Army EOD who we're supposed to believe despite his lowly rank (lets remember that a Lieutenant is the lowest of all officer ranks, and has little real authority) is the most important military man in the world. And the only EOD in the entire Army. Watch as he returns from a 14 month deployment, and then immediately leaves his family to fly to Japan to bail his father out of prison. Why? Because the plot needs him to be in Japan. Seriously, he doesn't even stay a night at home, he just jets off to Japan to bail out his dad. That's nothing compared to his wife though. After 14 months separated from her husband you'd think she would want him to stay for at least a little bit, right? Nope, she's the one encouraging him to go. It was so awkward I thought she must be having an affair. But no, its just a poorly written screen play with bad actors portraying poorly written characters. Outside of Kick Ass and the dearly departed Heisenberg there's really not one else in this film worth mentioning. Ken Watanabe is in it, but all he does is spout epically clich dialog in a melodramatic fashion, and then a bunch of generic military guys who say a bunch of generic military stuff. Watanabe even excited for Godzilla to show up and start destroying everything. For some reason he thinks Godzilla is a good guy. You know, after trying to nuke it to death back in the fifties. Making sense so far? No?

4. There is no reason to get emotionally invested in this movie at all.

Because the characters are so poorly written and so poorly portrayed there's little to no reason to get emotionally invested in them. This I would get if Godzilla was just trying to be a big silly monster bash but its not. It wants so desperately to be taken seriously, to effect its audience on an emotional level, but you can't do that when your characters are as clich, one dimensional, and unrelatable as they are here. Kick Ass has a wife and son, for example, but their relationship is regulated to a quick two minute scene in the very beginning before he flys away to Japan never to see them again. You want me to get emotionally involved? How about building up the family dynamic and having Kick Ass try his best to escape the city with his wife and child? How about giving them some freaking time together? How about, I don't know, having them do something except stare at the screen with a blank stare? I don't know, give me a reason, ANY reason, to get invested in them. THIS is the biggest reason they needed to keep Heisenberg. He shared maybe two minutes of screen time with his wife and her death was a real heart felt moment. I could see the pain in his eyes as he watched his wife die before his eyes. Some real heart breaking stuff there. After that we don't get anything anywhere CLOSE to it. If you want to make a movie that is emotionally involving you need to give me characters who aren't robots. Or at least not kill the characters who arent.

5. The marketing was a big fat lie.

OK, Ill admit that this may not be a complaint with the movie itself, but with the studio who marketed this film. But if you watched the trailer and then walked out of the movie feeling cheated, you aren't the only one. Im with you bro. The trailer was epic. It made Godzilla look like a movie about the king of the monsters wrecking everything, threatening the very survival of the human race, and beating up on some monsters as an added bonus. And starring Heisenberg!!! Hell yeah! Raise your hand if you thought Godzilla and Heisenberg were going to be the two biggest stars of this movie, and not Kick Ass and giant horny bug Pokmon. : Raises hand: Who thought it would have a consistent dark and serious tone with a well-known and beloved actor leading the charge against an unstoppable force of nature? :Raises hand again: Now are those unreasonable expectations considering the promotion for this film? No. Whats unreasonable is to expect anything else. Well SIKE, it was all a big fat money grabbing lie. Everything I was led to believe about this movie ended up not being anywhere close to the truth. You know its true; even if you liked the movie you know Im right. Dont try to sit here and tell me any different. Its like biting into a Twinkie after being promised fluffy marshmallow goodness and tasting a big fat turd instead.

6. The plot makes no sense.

Let me set the scene for you. Giant horny bug Pokmon #1 has just escaped a super top secret base in Japan and is now flying towards San Francisco to meet up with giant horny bug Pokmon #2 where they can then have giant bug Pokmon sex, lay a bunch of eggs (so basically the plot for 90s Godzilla), and settle down to raise a family. Meanwhile Godzilla for unexplained reason has decided hes spent enough time underwater and wants to come to the surface to kick some Pokmon butt. So whats the militarys response to THREE giant monsters converging on one of Americas largest cities? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. The militarys response to this enormous threat is so weak and ineffective they might as well not have been there at all. Seriously, they don't even try to stop Godzilla from reaching America, they just kind of accept that they cant. Asian dude claims Godzilla is a good guy, and they just leave it at that. There are a few scenes where their just lazily sailing alongside his spines and no one is shooting at him! Same with the other two monsters. No one even bothers to try to kill these things.

But I think my favorite idiotic moment is when they finally decide on a plan to stop them. What is their brilliant plan? Well its to ship a nuclear weapon by train all the way to San Francisco, sail it out into the middle of the ocean, and since the monsters are attracted to radiation and Godzilla is attracted- for some reason- to the monsters, theyll kill all three with one giant blast. Sounds like a great plan, right? At least until you stop to really think about it. First off, don't we have nuclear submarines in the Pacific? Arent all those war ships and carriers powered by nuclear reactors? Why not just, I don't know, put a nuclear submarine in the ocean, evacuate it, and then just set off the nukes in it when the monsters show up? Hell, why not FLY a warhead in? Why does it have to be transported via train? I realize that the monsters can knock planes out of the sky, but only if they get close to them. Not only that, but there is literally no protection given to the train transporting the warhead besides a couple dozen soldiers. No tanks, no planes or helicopters, no HUNVEEs with 50. Caliber machine guns or Mark 19s, nothing. Not only that, but they drive it RIGHT PAST WHERE THE GIANT FREAKING MONSTER IS. What, did they lose track of where the 500 ft high monster is? Did they forget where it was? Did they lose it? Apparently, because this thing just sneaks up on the train like its a damned ninja turtle or something. Even when they hear people screaming bloody murder as they are torn to pieces over the radio, they somehow don't reach the conclusion that maybe they shouldnt take the train through the creepy tunnel and across the rickety bridge. Maybe it would be best to get a satellite picture of what the area looks like, or send a recon team to find out where those dyeing soldiers are, or SOMETHING. Simply checking to see if the bridge is intact does NOTHING to confirm that the coast is clear. Surprise, surprise, the monster shows up, eats their nuke, and leaves. Derp, guess that wasn't the best of plans, huh? Funny thing is though, they had two nukes, and it straight up LEAVES the second. Why? Hell if I know. Because the plot called for it I guess. Speaking of which

7. Plot holes, inconsistencies, and convenient plot points.

Yeah, there are a lot of them. I spoke before about how Kick Ass inexplicably leaves his family after a 14 month long deployment the day he gets back; because he had to bail his dad out of jail in Japan where it just so happens the giant Pokmon monster is waiting. Why does he go to Japan? Why doesnt he just wire his dad some money? Does his dad not have any money for his own bail? Why not wait a few days before going? Well because the plot needs him in Japan of course, and they're going to get him there one way or another. Once in Japan he inexplicably- my new favorite word - agrees to go with his crazy dad into a quarantine zone to help him find some old floppy disks that have been exposed to the elements for the last fifteen years. Why does he agree to go with his dad? Not because he believes what his father says is true, but because the plot requires him to go. Once in the quarantine zone they get caught AGAIN by the authorities, yet instead of taking them to jail as theyd done to Heisenberg before, they instead decide to transport the two to their super-secret base where the monster is being held. Their justification for this is because Heisenberg used to work there, but that doesnt make any sense. Did Heisenberg not tell them he worked there the FIRST time he got arrested? That was what, a few days prior? If that? Why the sudden need to have Heisenberg and Kick Ass present at the super-secret base? Say it with me now, because the plot needed them to be there. Its like they were reading the script or something.

Fast forward. Kick Ass is now in Nevada, I think? How did he get there? Why is he there? I don't know, anyway, he just so happens to be in a town where the nuke train just so happens to be going by, and he lets the guys in charge know hes a super important lieutenant, (a Sgt Major was apparently the highest ranking individual there, for some reason) and convinces them to let him go with the train to San Francisco. Because there are no other EOD guys going with the train. And no experts on nuclear weapons. Because the Army is stupid. OK, that part I can believe (joking, Im an Air Force guy, so of course the Army is stupid to me). Now I guess hes the only person in the entire world capable of disarming this bomb, so when they need a bunch of soldiers to make a HELO jump into the city of course hes the one they call. Never mind that hes EOD and therefor would have had no reason at all to be trained to make HELO jumps. Its certainly never established that hes ever been trained to do so. So why is he the one making this jump? Because the plot- yeah yeah yeah, I know I know.

8. Godzilla VS the giant horny bug Pokmon.

So I already talked about how silly Godzilla looked, but what about the two Mutos he has to fight? Out of the wide array of classic Toho monsters which ones did they end of going with? Rodan? Mothera? Gigan? King Ghedorah? No? Bugs you say? Bugs who just want to bone and make little babies? Umm, what? Giant horny bugs who look like Pokmon? Shirley you cant be serious. Oh but I am. I guess I don't understand why they couldn't just use one of the dozens upon dozens of classic Kiju monsters to pull from they decide instead to go with giant Pokmon look alikes. They weren't HORRIBLE, in their defense, there are plenty of Japanese monsters way worse than they (and one American Godzilla monster) but they were quite underwhelming. Seeing these lame monsters kick Godzillas butt all the way up until the end didn't help. The only saving grace about them was that they died in pretty epic ways. Thats something, I guess.

9. It doesn't learn the lessons of the last American Godzilla.

So what is the central threat these giant monsters pose to humanity? As destructive as two giant bugs running around in a major city are, thats hardly an apocalyptic threat. Just shoot them with guns and bombs until they die. Well, the threat is that they are horny and want to make a bunch of bug monster babies. So basically the plot of the 90s Godzilla. Havent we learned anything? Wasnt it stupid as hell to add that idiotic egg subplot to the first American Godzilla? Why do we need to have a do over of that horrible, horrible film? When Kick Ass manages to kill the little baby eggs we even get the mommy bug monster crying over them and chasing him through the streets just like the 90s Godzilla. Seeing how universally hated that movie is, Im not sure who thought this was a good idea.

10. The epic reveal shots and annoying cut aways.

You know what gets annoying after a while? Epic reveal shots. Now don't get me wrong, I love an epic reveal as much as the next guy, and if anyone deserves the most epic of all epic reveal shots its Godzilla. But my God, you don't need to give him a big introduction every single time we see as if weve never seen him before. We already know what he looks like, weve seen him a half dozen times before, so why on earth does the director feel the need to pretend like every time we see him is the VERY FIRST TIME? Its not necessary. But thats not even the worst part. No, the worst part is when we get that epic reveal and then it suddenly cuts away for no reason so we don't get to see any of the action. Example. The very first time we get a full body shot of Godzilla is when hes confronting the first giant bug monster in Honolulu. He comes out of the water, hes wrecking everything, but we don't actually get to see him. Everything is building to Godzillas first big fight with the Muto. He steps in front of the camera, it slowly pans up so we can see him in all his fatty glory. He bends down and roars as loud and awesomely as he can. Oh damn, its about to go down! Godzilla and Muto are going to fight!!! SIKE! Instead they cut away to a news reel and show about five seconds worth of fighting. This kind of nonsense just kept happening too. Every time the movie geared up for an epic fight it would suddenly cut away to robotic Kick Ass, or a news reel, or something lame, because no one who pays to see a Godzilla movie could possibly want to see Godzilla fight.

But there are a couple things I liked about Godzilla 2014.
1. The Special effects were pretty good.
2. Heisenberg was amazing.
And thats about it really. The first twenty minutes, you know, the part with Heisenberg in it, were actually pretty darn good. Thats about all I can say in this films defense."
1439,4.0,"In all honesty, the history of Godzilla is not my forte.  What I do know is that, like Superman, Godzilla is a character (a kind reference since monster would be a better description) that largely everyone has at least heard of and could pick out of a police line-up.  Other than that, the western hemisphere has a rather reclusive relationship with the oversized lizard-like creature, as Godzilla rarely dons the big screen in North America.  The most recent Godzilla flick (domestically) to receive a wide release was in 1998  starring Matthew Broderick, which was met with negative reviews and lack of enthusiasm.  Still, they say time heals all wounds, but has a 16-year absence made the hearts of moviegoers grow fonder for Gojira (thats Japanese for Godzilla)?

Warning!  Minors Spoilers are included in this review.  Nothing drastic, but if you don't want any plot details  refrain from reading any further.

Directed by Gareth Edwards (Monsters), Godzilla stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Lieutenant Ford Brody and Bryan Cranston as his father, Joe.  The film begins several years prior when Ford is a young boy and his father is a nuclear plant supervisor in a town outside Tokyo, Japan.  An abrupt explosion and radiation leak, allegedly attributed to an earthquake, leads to the complete contamination of the area and a tragedy that will forever change the lives of the Brody family.

In the present day, Joe is hopelessly obsessed with the accident  which he doesnt believe was an earthquake.  Ford has just returned home from a military tour to the loving embrace of his wife, Elle (Elizabeth Olsen), and their young son.  Soon after his arrival home, hes informed that his father has been arrested for trespassing in the restricted zone where the accident took place.  After flying to Japan to meet his father, another accident proves Joes theory correct  along with proof that the government has been secretly keeping a large insect-looking monster subdued (and is the source of the disastrous tremors).

The creature manages to free itself, revealing that it feeds off nuclear power (and send out electromagnetic pulses that kill technology).  Shortly thereafter, another creature (its mate) begins terrorizing cities, too.  One of the scientists working on the creatures is Dr. Ichiro Serizawak (Ken Watanabe), who is also modestly aware of Godzillas existence  a large water based creature that was supposedly killed from the bomb dropping on Hiroshima during World War II.  He believes Godzilla is alive, and will return to defeat the attacking monsters as a means of restoring balance and order to the world.  Regardless, the U.S. military cant rely on a creature to save them, prompting them to concoct their own means of defeating the destructive creatures.

In comparison to the 1998 version of Godzilla, this 2014 reboot is far superior in every conceivable manner.  The main issue that hampered the 98 film was that it resembled too much Jurassic Park and not enough good ol fashioned monster chaos.  To this new films credit, which is a story conceived by David Callaham (The Expendables), this Godzilla is about as realistic a monster movie as anyone could possibly imagine.  Yes, theres an abundance of buildings toppling over while freaking, feisty pre-historic animals run-a-muck in every direction, yet at no point does this flick feel overly hokey or disingenuous.  Ultimately, if the world were to be overcome by overgrown monsters, the military would likely respond in the exact manner as they do in this picture.

Like the majority of movies that focus on monsters and destruction, theres no particular reason to overanalyze the acting  even regardless of whos in the starring roles.  Aaron Taylor-Johnson, best known for his lead in the Kick-Ass films, is surprisingly unrecognizable  all decked out in military attire and sporting a clean-cut look.  He carries the film adequately, yet its difficult to say hes a vital actor in this role.  Honestly, Bryan Cranston exudes nearly all of the dramatic juice in his quest to get to the bottom of whats happening in the Japanese restricted area.  Elizabeth Olsen chimes in here and there as the only dominant female presence (other than the angry, pregnant monster), yet she often feels out of place and superfluous.  Regardless, at the end of the day  everyone comes to see Godzilla.

Brace yourself, folks  because Godzilla doesnt show his face until roughly an hour into the movie.  Oddly enough, the insect-looking bad guys each received additional screen time in order to present Godzilla as the good guy  as opposed to the villain of the story, like in the 98 version.  When the fire-breathing Godzilla does rear that recognizable mug (screaming like nobodys business), he (or she) is ready for battle.  Sadly, though, just when you think Godzilla is about to go toe-to-toe with the opponents, the majority of the action is skipped  picking-up with the aftermath.  Apparently, this was an attempt to reserve the full-blown action for the climax.  The problem with that is you're left (lets be honest here) with the minimal amount of time for the films actual attraction.

Overall, Godzilla is an above average monster movie that will maintain your attention for the duration and eventually, send you home happy  but it doesnt overly scream blockbuster sensation.  The undeniable complaint about the film is the fact that it leans hard on the plot  meaning Godzillas screen time is lower than it needed to be due to the progression of the storyline.  Family ties play a large role in the lives of the main characters, but have no fear  those subjective plot points are all tied up very nicely.  So if you're expecting a cliffhanger to point to a sequel, theres none to be had here.  In the end, if you're a fan of cataclysmic destruction or monster movies, youll be in Heaven with what this new interpretation of Godzilla has to offer.  Its direct and to the point  a bit heavy on CGI at times (to be expected), but in general, it should appease all those that had a great deal of anticipation going into this flick.

GRADE:  B-

1440,3.0,"I'm honestly not really sure why I'm even writing this. If you watched the first two films and cared at all, you're getting this. If you're like me and watched Evangelion during its original series coming to fruition, you'll watch it and...Well...Maybe not as fondly.

Look, a few key points out of the way.

First, watch the first two films if you haven't in a while, or you'll be completely lost from the get-go. There is no backtracking, nothing in the way of ""THE STORY THUS FAR"", nothing even close to that. Moreover, this story has almost nothing to do with the original, so thinking you'll be okay if you can recite the original's script isn't really good enough. It's its own thing.

Second, this isn't even really in the spirit of Evangelion, at least not the kind I'm used to, because it's in almost no way a character-driven story. In fact, there's virtually no character development at all, or even any scenes that have character development. Everything is kept vague to an overdriven maximum, particularly when it comes to motivation and emotional development. It's just not there.

Third, and this is to both put your mind at ease and enforce your assumptions, this is one big Kaworu showcase. Some have said there are homosexual overtones between the two, and those people are wrong. There aren't. At all. There never have been, unless you're destructively ignorant when it comes to what Kaworu represents (by the creator's words, if you need them). It's 100% ""Shinji makes a friend who actually seems to overtly care about him, and is able to show it"", which is essentially the same theme the television series had. Arguably even less so because the TV series had a bath scene that isn't comparable to anything here. Seriously, it'd annoy me to death if they went the fangirl-service route, and they didn't, they resisted that and kept the integrity of their relationship at its core, so I'm glad about that.

Fourth, this film is to Evangelion as Man of Steel is to the original Superman comics. Or Chrono Cross is to Chrono Trigger. Or Master of Orion 3 is to Master of Orion 2. Okay, I spent a good three minutes trying to think of good examples, and that's the best I can do, but the point is it's super-different in virtually every way that means anything to anyone, even if it technically has the same universe involved. I mean, you know, with some liberties, of course.

Going with that, I'd still recommend seeing it, if you really want a recommendation, but with a lot of trepidation and a freaking massive amount of caution in your expectations. The fact is, they won't match. Whatever you wanted to happen in 3.33, it almost certainly does not. Whatever you wanted to see more of in 3.33, it almost certainly does not happen; or if it actually does, is not presented in a way that you wanted.

It's pretty, it's got some cool scenes, and it's worth at least a view, but the fact is that it feels like dead filler between 2.22 and whenever 4.44 happens. When you almost completely lack character development like this, you're really taking away from what makes Evangelion cool to begin with. And, naturally, if you do take the characters away (or at least, almost all of them in favor of a couple), you'd sure as hell better make what's on the screen worth the sacrifice.

And, well, no, that sacrifice doesn't feel worth it. It's Evangelion in image, for the most part. Not so much in spirit. Or creativity, for that matter.

And, perhaps most importantly, it's not as good as 1.0 or 2.0. Not even close. Something just went wrong here that didn't really happen in 1.0 or 2.0, primarily in the way of story and presentation, but you could take that to many levels.

I already am sad that I didn't see more of Touji's sister, because I thought she was going to...Get more of a chance, I guess, to be a character. For someone who is presented as important at first...I mean, the whole film feels like that, really. In short, it's ""Here's the characters. Now watch as we don't do a thing with almost any of them. Now, here's some more Kaworu and Shinji, sans substance."""

1443,5.0,"Loved it, loved it, loved it, loved it, I freaking loved this episode.  Brilliant, just brilliant.  The writing, acting, directing; all of it was top notch and just perfect.  I couldn't ask for a better episode.  Loved it!"
1444,3.0,"The fast n furious series has hit a all time low. They went from trying to put on good streat races to trying to give you big stars with hollywood chases from the popo. It took a left turn when they added rock, that's when it really went tooooo hollywood. Ok let me stop blablering about the series and get to this movie.

This one only had about 2 wow moments, the freaking 15 mile runway strip(not) with the car holding the plane down(blabla) and the tank on the road keeping up with fast muscle cars? ummmm yeah. See it's moments like that that make you go this isn't realistic they're just going for brownie points on trying to have those wow moments that everyone talks about. like how you're going to land inside another car once a tank flips over and throws you out. So i gave this move a 3 because they focused on wow moments instead of giving you those high speed drag races."
1445,3.0,"It's a hilarious show that will offend everyone who watches it.  Can't wait to get it on DVD, but there is no info here of how many episodes, any clue as to what exactly you're getting...the first season could be fewer episodes than I want to pay thirty freaking dollars for it.  Tosh not making enough money as it is??????"
1446,4.0,Very cute movie.  I love all things Austen too and Keri Russell was the perfect heroine.  You'll end up googling J.J. Feild after this movie - his accent is freaking sexy.  (I'd say better than Benedict Cumberbatch).  Good to rent.  I may buy this so that I can get my occasional Austen fix.
1447,2.0,"they spend a freaking hour and half talking about the hunger games. the whole movie you are like can we get on with the killing. Yes i'm a gladiator/wrath of the titans like fan. but c'mon toooooo much talking. I know this is a teenage book turned movie so expect the loving cutscenes all the time. but the thing that gets me just like part 1 they spent too much time just talking and not enough in the hunger games. on top of that the ending was more of can we all just get along and end the whole hunger games annual thing..... So no mercy here, show me more of the games and less of some cry baby crying over the village being treated bad."
1448,5.0,"AMERICAN HORROR STORY: COVEN takes us to new levels of horror, terror, debauchery and suspense. The writers throw in everything imaginable in Season 3. Witchcraft, voodoo, incest, murder, torture, mutilation, resurrection and maybejust maybe some redemption. Its a freakingly creepy and chilly.
COVEN is a womens story. The main characters are women of all ages from teen to senior. Finally, the women are in power and older actresses have surprisingly meaty roles. The young actresses have their parts to play but finally we see some delightfully talented older actresses show the youngsters what it is all about. Jessica Lange again plays the aging beauty in a race against time. This time she is Fiona Goode, the SUPREME witch and needless to say there is nothing good about her.
Cast members from previous seasons also return. Evan Peters has been put together and gets to show some fine acting chops and emotions without the use of words. Jamie Brewer returns as Nan. Shes not your typical witch. Kudos to the writers for using this lovely actress with Down Syndrome. Nans romantic story with a neighbor boy begins to shine and then fizzles. Here was a wonderful chance for a different love story that was not fulfilled.
COVEN is not for the weak spirited. Blood and gore flow in this season in a story that sometimes loses its way in a mesh of story lines.  Kathy Bates as the gloriously wicked Delphine LaLaurie makes the horror of slavery seen in 12 YEARS A SLAVE seem like a day in the park. LaLaurie, based on a real person, abuses and tortures her slaves in a way that would make even the strongest weak in the heart. COVEN seems to have crossed some lines with this horror. Nonetheless, Bates gives the role her all and nothing can outshine her. And then there is the lovely Angela Bassett looking more sexy than ever and somehow has worked her magic to look 20 years younger than her age in real life. Her Marie Laveau is deliciously evil in a shockingly frightening way.
Gorgeous Lily Rabe is the witch named Misty Day who has the power to resurrect the dead. She is obsessed with Stevie Nicks and before we know it the rock legend appears in an a couple of odd scenes where she plays herself. Stevie sings a couple of songs and it all seems so out of placea chance to just fill some air time it seems.
Sprinkled in all the horror are bits of comedy. Hey, come on. If you are a good witch looking in to an open grave and you know a bad witch is standing behind you, cant you or the audience guess what is coming next? The light moments provide some respite from all the decadent evil and horror in this season.
Here is a magnificent cast in some seriously meaty roles in an often gruesome story. It is not for the easily offended or upset. The storyline can get confusing as people die but are resurrected and it seems like even those who are immortal somehow end of dying. At times, nothing is clear. If you are in some sort of witch induced limbo for decades and are released are you dead or alive and how do you end up with an apartment and job? Ask the ax man.
Surprisingly, COVEN loses steam and energy in the last two episodes as the witches test each other to be the next SUPREME. It becomes slow moving and tedious as if the writers had exhausted all their creativity by the end of the season. It is a disappointing and unfulfilling season finale but it was sure some wild ride getting there."
1449,2.0,"OK, so this is just awful.  The idea starts OK, but then just goes all over the place with little or no direction.  Everyone is killing everyone and then they are brought back to life and all is forgiven.  A bitter and deadly rivalry between the Coven and The Voodoos is then forgiven after the Voodoos try to wipe out the Coven.  Queenie goes to the Coven and tries to kill the Stevie Nicks chick, then she is accepted back into the Coven again.  Stevie Nicks actually sings a really cheesy song in an episode so they can all just look at her and be amazed even though a few days ago they all tried to kill one another.  Kathy Bates character is all over the place too.  What a freaking mess this season was!  Queenie is the worst actress ever.  Every time she talks its just so freaking bad! And what is with that goofy looking soul stealing devil dude? He is so freaking stupid to look at! Thank God for Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates, their acting at least makes watching this somewhat bearable.  I can go on and on about just how horrible this was, but you get my point.  I am not sure if they hired new writers for every episode or what, but this was just awful.  Save yourself the time and put on a Fleetwood Mac CD and chant some nonsense with a Voodoo Doll in hand.  That will be much more entertaining than Coven.  OH yeah, the intro to each episode with that creepy Demon thingy is the highlight, and much scarier than anything that ever happens in any episode."
1450,4.0,Johnny Knoxville is freaking crazy !

1452,5.0,This movie is freaking HILARIOUS!  oh..my...God.  I cannot tell you how many times we had to rewind because we were laughing so hard we missed parts.  seriously...HILARIOUS.
1453,5.0,"I was one of the lucky ones that got to see an early preview of this movie.  Thank you Seal of Honor FB page for the link for the tickets.

Let me start off by saying I was very familiar with this story before I saw the movie having read Lone Survivor book as well as the book by Sofrep on the rescue of Marcus Luttrell.  I have read all of the books on Murph.  I am so glad this movie was made, so more people can know the sacrifice made by our military and their families.

Let me give you a little background on the premiere I was at - it was packed, people were trying to sneak sit in aisles because every seat in the theater was taken.  I was lucky enough to have a group of 7 jack wagons behind me that were very vocal - always a bonus right?  They had a comment about most of the people in the theater and especially the girls.  Trust me by the time the movie started I knew which cup size they preferred as well as brunettes vs blonde.  I was really worried that I was going to end up getting into with them if they were disrespectful in the movie.  Guess what, never an issue.  This movie was so emotionally wrenching that all I heard from them or really anyone in the audience was an occational, oh F*, or sniffling, yes sniffling.  I don't think there was a dry eye in the place. Didn't matter if they were guy's or girls.

You read the book, you visualize it, but you don't visualize how steep that freaking hill was, or how bad it was falling down it.  You picture the fire fight, but just can't quite get the overwhelming number they were against.  This movie does a great job bringing it to life.  You can't really picture how bad the wounds were.  I knew it in my head, but seeing it and the fact they keep going is just heart stopping and painful.

Accuracy based on book - Mostly.  Rescue of Marcus - a little more Hollywood.  So not perfect, but I think what the movie was going for was getting the emotions right.  The way I feel if is the families left behind are okay with this movie, I am not going to pick at it.  Those are really the only people that have a right to say anything about details.

I loved seeing how the guys interacted before they left, they did a good job of showing how tight knit the team was.  It also brought out Matt Axelson and Danny Dietz and showcased them and their bravery.  I think more people know about Murph or Marcus, and now they will know about Axe and Danny too.  Also everyone on the chopper.  The Seals and Night Stalkers.

The worst part of this movie is knowing you are not getting the ending you want.  You start hoping for it, you watch the fire fight, you know what is going to happen, and you are still devastated when it does.

When we finally left the movie, there were still people just sitting with tears streaming down their face.  So bring Kleenex.  Don't let that deter you from seeing it.  I think this is the best war film ever made, I especially loved the tribute to all that gave their life at the end.  Operation Red Wings is so heartbreaking, I have always said my hero's wear dog tags not jerseys, and I hope more people feel that way after seeing this.

Sorry if this is disjointed, it has been a couple weeks and I am still emotional about it.  Maybe dumb, but I get super emotional over our military.  I will be going to see this again when it is released and taking my Godsons to it.  They need to know what sacrifices are made for our freedoms.

1454,4.0,"Jason (Brian Tee) is nice, befuddled sort of ad executive who has just been jilted at the altar by his bride to be (via an arranged marriage) - and yet that's not the worst of his problems.  Due to a family curse, Jason has to be married by the age of thirty or else he will die, and with the thwarted wedding his over-anxious family (his parents, especially) are freaking out over the possibility of losing their son.  When a business trip to Korea finds Jason meeting and having one date with a girl he met at work, after returning home the two end up growing closer and more in love, via phone and internet, to the point where Brian proposes and she agrees to relocate to Los Angeles for the wedding.  But a very surprising twist may throw the entire marriage - and Jason's life - into turmoil, in a funny, sweet and endearing romantic comedy exploring culture and family ... and firmly anchored by the charm of its male lead in Tee (along with a brilliant cast), who proves he can handle romantic comedy as deftly as the more dramatic - even sinister - characters he normally plays."
1455,2.0,"If my wife was as ugly as Captain Flip-Flop's, I'd go to sea for 6 months too. Was Meg Ryan busy that day?

I'm sorry, aside from the cool Navy Seal stuff at the end, this was the most boring movie in history. The pirates were more sympathetic and interesting than anyone on the ship. I was cheering for them, if you want to know the truth.

Why does the Academy love to give awards to multi-millionaire actors pretending to be retarded? Why? I want an answer, dammit!

Imagine Bogart or Robert Mitchum or William Holden in this role. Would they be as limp as Tom Hanks? I wanted to rush up on the screen and lend him a walker.

Or even go cross-grain a bit and cast Mickey Rourke channeling Bogart. make the guy INTERESTING.

Why don't they make movies with actual male leads anymore? Do we have ANYONE, aside from Russell Crowe, who is close to being an actual MALE?

Sorry, I just watched Magnificent Seven the other night, which has LOTS of actual men. Looking at the current crop of actors is just sad. Matt Damon? George Clooney? Christian Bale? Are you freaking serious? (though to be fair, Mathew McConaghey (sp) is turning into an interesting actor)

There was ONE hilarious scene, though I don't think it was intentional. When Captain Philips logged on to his computer to e-mail his wife, I was waiting for the screen to come up ""You've Got Mail"". Now THAT would have been funny.

One reviewer mentioned the director had worked with Matt Damon on two Jason Bourne movies. Let me make this clear. Matt Damon as an action hero is to Jason Statham like Budweiser is to a McCallan 18 year old. Damon can be interesting in intellectual roles, but action? It is to laugh.

Save your money and your time and screen The Wild Bunch or Once Upon A Time in The West and see how it's done."
1456,1.0,"Dear lord, where to start...
Okay, first the positives:

 Kevin Konroy's replacement for Batman isn't terrible
 Cyborg, Hal Jordan, and Darkseid are all voiced nicely.
 The art style has a cool anime look to it.
 The movie is very loyal to the novel in terms of the plot

The Negatives:

 The writers can't decide who the hell this movie is for, as characters awkwardly say TV-PG phrases like ""freaking"" and ""butt"", but later say words like ""s***"". Also, there's plenty of violence (which is fine!, but make up your mind about which audience you're targeting).

 Shazaam is in this movie instead of Aquaman, and Shazaam sucks... a lot.

 The voice acting for the vast majority of characters (Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, etc.) is abysmal. I'd wager the voice actors phoned in a lot of these lines.

 Shazaam is in this movie... (I'm sorry, but I feel it needed to be stated a second time... he seriously ruins the movie).

 Cyborg's origin isn't adequately explained in the film like it is in the comics.

The overall quality just feels cheap. Bruce Timm (the guy who was in charge from Batman the animated series through Justice League: Unlimitied) showed us just how amazing and mature these superhero stories can be. This film made me realize just how badly I took Timm for granted."
1457,3.0,"This is based on the New 52 relaunch of the Justice League. Counting the various comic books, relaunches, videos, graphic novels, and the like, I suspect we're up to over a dozen different versions of the Justice League origin, with more likely to come in the years ahead. There is one significant difference between this movie and the New 52 version, and that is that Aquaman has been replaced by Shazam (Captain Marvel).

The movie takes place fairly early in the career of all of these heroes, before they are truly recognized as heroes. A suspicious U.S. government wants to imprison and study them rather than let them have free reign. The movie opens with news about a wave of abductions by mysterious winged creatures, with speculation that it might be the new vigilante, Batman, who's at fault. Green Lantern runs into one of these abductions and foils it, but is then attacked by the creature until he's rescued by Batman. After a long chase, the creature escapes into the sewer.

The interplay between Green Lantern and Batman is amusing, as this is before either of them has met the other. Particularly amusing is the sequence where Green Lantern tries to figure out what powers Batman has: ""Wait, you're not just some guy in a bat costume, are you?! Are you freaking kidding me?!""

Batman and GL track the creature and find him planting a device, whereupon GL rushes to attack. The creature utters a cry, ""For Darkseid,"" and blows itself up. GL manages to save both of them, after which they examine the device and reach the conclusion that it's alien: ""Alien? You mean like the guy in Metropolis?""

We segue to S.T.A.R. labs, where Dr. Silas Stone is scanning an identical device, brought to him by the Flash, that had been planted in Central City. All they've been able to find is that it's emitting a signal, a signal that is also emanating from similar devices in other cities. We see Dr. Stone get a reminder about ""Victor's football game - Now,"" a reminder he ignores. At the game, a depressed Victor keeps looking in vain for his father. A young Billy Batson sneaks into the stadium and sits in the seat reserved for Vic's father, and then meets Vic after the game in the locker room.

The next stop is a trip to the White House, where a group of people have gathered to protest against Wonder Woman, who has arrived at the White House with Steve Trevor in a limousine. A confused Wonder Woman, new to man's world, is flabbergasted to learn that they are protesting her.

We return to Green Lantern and Batman, who have tracked down Superman in Metropolis. A cocky GL goes after Superman, confident that he's got the power to imprison him so that they can investigate. Alas, he is sadly mistaken. Batman gives it everything he's got but can't even cause Superman to blink. After a fight, Batman manages to stop Superman with a single word, ""Clark,"" as they finally start talking instead of fighting. ""Someone is strategically placing these boxes; we have to find out who and why before it's too late.""

Victor Stone confronts his father in the lab, as we find out that the gulf between father and son is as wide as the Grand Canyon. The device in the lab activates, nearly destroying Victor in the process. Silas and his associates take Victor into ""The Red Room,"" containing new and untried technology from multiple sources. Using this technology, they fight desperately to keep Victor alive, replacing what he's lost with cybernetic components, giving birth to Cyborg (a cruder version that we're used to in other versions we've seen).

All over the world, we finally see what the devices were: portals into another world, used for a wholesale invasion from Apokolips of armored demonic fighters, under the orders of Darkseid. The heroes, Batman, Green Lantern, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Shazam, and a newly-minted Cyborg, do their best but they're in danger of being overwhelmed. They have one edge, though: Cyborg's new technologies allow him to tap into the signal from Apokolips, giving him vital information.

To give any more information would spoil the movie. Suffice to say that a lot happens, the threat grows, and the heroes (and the world) are overwhelmed. There is only one chance....

The personalizations don't always work for me, as Green Lantern is pretty much a brash, arrogant jerk. We know that is likely overcompensation, but it just doesn't jibe with what we know of Hal Jordan in his prior incarnations. There has always been a bit of cockiness in his personality but this was too much. Similarly, Shazam is too much the annoying kid.

The animation is very good but there are no real standout sequences, just good solid work. The voice acting is the same: very solid but no real standout performances. The action sequences are good, particularly when the heroes are clicking on all cylinders in the final fight with Darkseid. I've given this movie 3 stars but it's really a 3.5 star movie, as it's a fun mindless, popcorn romp. It's not the best that this studio has done but it's an okay adaptation of the original source material."
1458,3.0,"I found this film watchable and I don't regret that I saw it - but having waited sooooo long for a movie in which Stallone and Schwarzenegger would appear together (for real, not just in short glimpses) I was a little bit disappointed. It was definitely not even half as good as I hoped. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Ray Breslin (Stallone) is a highly paid specialist who offers a unique kind of services - he gets incarcerated in prisons to test their security. He usually finds a lot of flaws, including in the strictest high security facilities... One day he is send to test a very, very exceptionnal place, run by a strange warden (Jim Caviezel). Once inside, he quickly realises that there is something very wrong both with this place and his own situation. He also befriends another inmate, a certain Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger), who seems to be the object of particular attention from all the guards... And then the story begins.

Before going into the film itself, for once I decided to beef up my review with some bulls**t psychology, so here it is. Did you notice how often Stallone plays characters escaping or running away from something/somebody? Well, let's have a count (precision - I include only the films I saw):

- ""Rocky"" - escapes from misery and failure
- ""Paradise Alley"" - escapes from misery and failure
- ""Rocky II"" - escapes from misery and failure
- ""Escape to victory"" - escapes from a Nazi prisoner camp
- ""Rambo: the first blood"" - runs away from a redneck sheriff and the whole freaking division of National Guard
- ""Rambo II"" - escapes from Vietnam with American MIAs
- ""Cobra"" - runs away from a gang of satanistic murderers (but gets caught by his future bisexual cheating gold-digging wife...)
- ""Rambo III"" - escapes from Afghanistan
- ""Lock up"" - runs away from a high security prison run by a sadistic warden (already...)
- ""Tango and Cash"" - runs away from a high security prison run by a sadistic warden (is there a pattern here?)
- ""Cliffhanger"" - runs away from a gang of ruthless murderers AND from his past...
- ""Assassins"" - runs away from Antonio Banderas...
- ""Daylight"" - escapes from a watery grave...
- ""Cop Land"" - tries to escape from failure and from his past...
- ""Antz"" - tries to escape a genocidal general (but gets caught by Jennifer Lopez)
- ""D-Tox"" - tries to escape from a morbid depression and a serial killer
- ""Driven"" - tries to escape from a lot of racing cars (ultimately wins the third place...)
- ""Rambo"" (the fourth film) - escapes from Burma
- ""Bullet to the head"" - tries to escape from Khal Drogo...)))
- and finally this film...

OK, now I am done playing doctor and I can get to the review of the film itself.

There was potential in this film and there are some nice ideas and some good moments in it - in fact there is even a couple of twists which I didn't see coming. The cast is very good, as other than the actors already mentioned we have in smaller roles Sam Neill, Vincent d'Onofrio, Amy Ryan (""The Wire"") and last but not least a very, very bad and very, very bald Vinnie Jones...))) There is also a couple of good one liners - but not too many... Finally, Jim Caviezel's character is quite interesting - in fact he seems to be that guy who will one day become Mr Reese from ""Person of Interest"", it's just that he didn't meet Finch yet...)))

There is however also a lot of weak points. First let's say that most of the scenario doesn't make the SLIGHTEST sense - but I cannot really be more specific, as it would provide spoilers. The whole prison break is ultimately very disappointing as a place which seemed to be the ultimate challenge for a professional master of escape is revealed to have more holes in its security than swiss cheese... Some plot holes are so enormous that they actually made me laugh (one of them concerns security cameras...). Finally, sorry for a little SPOILER here but any prison which relies on security guards carrying firearms in areas where they can have real physical contact with inmates, well, such a place is not a high security prison - it is a MAJOR DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN!

The scenes with Stallone and Schwarzenegger are a disappointment. There was a lot of potential here for humour, tension and drama - and there is very little of any of them... The whole idea of Muslim inmates was horribly mismanaged, mostly because of enormous amount of political correctness - clearly the director didn't want them to be terrorists, so he made them into drug trafficking gangsters. But because they are Muslim, somehow they appear as honorable, heroic characters...

Let's not even talk about Sam Neill's character, a pathetic, clueless doctor who needs to check in a book what is the Hippocratic oath...)))... Poor Sam Neill, he clearly REALLY needed a paycheck...

It is a disappointing film. Rating it three stars is probably too generous - but I simply couldn't force myself to rate lower the first real Stallone-Schwarzenegger film ever... Recommended obviously for all rabid Stallone and Schwarzenegger fans (like me) - but if you are not one, well, don't expect too much..."
1459,5.0,HELL YEAH! Now this is a kickk ass movie! Lots of action crazy scenes some funny ones but mostly just all freaking action! I loveeeeeeeeeeeed it!
1460,5.0,It's freaking awesome
1461,5.0,freaking awesome
1462,3.0,"Another Marvel Cinematic Universe movie that was pumped out to keep people interested until Avengers: Age of Ultron. The villain is lame and 1-dimensional (he wants to turn off the dark, like Spider-man's lame broadway musical), Thor and Jane's romance was forced and they y lacked any real chemistry.

Too much focus was put on Loki, I know people love him, but even when he was involved, he didn't do much. Loki is killed, but just like the first movie where he died by falling to his death, it's revealed later he is still alive (they do the character dies/isn't really dead BS in EVERY MARVEL STUDIOS MOVIE).

Kat Dennings is back with her annoying character, who has her own even more annoying sidekick to make the movie even more grating. We get to see more of Asgard, that was pretty cool.

Like Iron Man 3, the love interest beats the main villain of the film instead of the hero, because Marvel is terrified of being labeled sexist. Sure, Thor holds off Malekith while Jane prepares the device, but it's ultimately Jane who beats the baddie.

Finally comes the freaking ending, which is a MASSIVE PLOTHOLE.

Thor is unable to see through Loki's illusion and can't tell that it's Loki in disguise as their father. But just earlier in the movie after their mother's death, Thor goes to speak to Loki who has trashed his cell and is sitting disheveled and in mourning over the only person he really cared about besides himself. Loki is using an illusion to appear like his usual smug self, but Thor can see through it. But then at the end? He can't. Why? Because the series needs to rely on the plot hole to warrant more freaking Loki later.

The New York references were annoying as well. Like we need reminders that the Avengers happened. Watching Jane slap Loki while saying, ""That was for New York"" was eye-roll worthy.

The movie was average, and frankly, I think the solo movies are pointless at this point, since everyone only watches them to stay occupied while waiting for the next Avengers."
1463,5.0,"This is a ""Pay attention or you will miss it"" movie.  The multiple colliding plot lines require you put the movie on Pause while you take care of things that don't include piecing all the details fed to you, in the order they are presented.  I had to actually watch it in two parts or I'd have missed out.  Christian Bale; I respect the heck out of this man who has bulked up and is just freaking awesome as the comb-over Irving.  Much has already been said by great movie reviewers; I'm just here to add to the positives...a great movie."
1464,4.0,"Well, I've seen both the Korean original and then this one.
I don't think there any shame and preferring the remake to the original because this one is about twenty minutes shorter (and I was feeling the two hour mark while watching the original) and feels lighter somehow.
Probably because they did  away with a few of the things we see in the original that aren't 100% necessary to tell this tale.
Also in the true spirit of Hollywood the plot is spelled out for you pretty well....the dots are all connected for you by the end which is good because the overall story is so freaking out there that without confirmation some might not be sure that the plot is what it is.
This happened to me after watching the original ...at the end I was like OK did I just see what I think I saw?
After watching this one  it confirmed that I understood the original even though many story details are quite different.
For example in the original the main character was imprisoned for 15 years and in this one it was changed to 20 years.
There are bigger differences then that but the main point is even if you just watch this one, I found that it was entertaining as much as the first one and more accessible to others who may not enjoy reading subtitles or watching people bite into a live octopus.
Bottom line this is more then just watchable and quite enjoyable  and it may not be the original but hey still very good and some will like this much better then the original.
So if you like WTF style mysteries then yeah you have to check out Oldboy original or remake (both solid movies)."
1465,4.0,"If you don't mess around on our partner, especially with her very best friend.

Finding out that someone who is so into you and you into them intimately and so close --------is banging someone else and playing you------
Well, that  can trigger a person into doing some vicious things to try and feel better from the low blow she just got hit with. Annalynne McCord is so freaking crazy and fun to watch. She cracks me up too. And in the movie Excision or Incision, (I think is the name) she was obsessed with being a Dr. and blood and it was sooooooooooooooooo crazzzzyyyy and sick, that I just loved it. She is a trip to say the least. Needs to be in more movies. Plays a Beyoutch to the hilt."

1468,2.0,"JCVD does an interesting job playing a wacky villain in this overly predictable story.  The characters as a whole were pretty decent - except for the standard stupid and inept cops - but the concept was just one cliche after another, and the ending was really, really silly (they fought in a tree, a freaking tree).
I do not expect action movies to be dramatic masterpieces, but I like to think that the story will at least try to be a little unpredictable and/or original.  Enemies Closer failed at this."
1469,5.0,"Coming from a person who doesn't watch a lot of this genre of movie, this movie, well, is fantastic. It'll make you chuckle, laugh, tear up, and cry. A freaking fantastic piece of a story. It is like a very matured and relevant My Neighbor Totoro amalgamated with Spirited Away. Such a great story and for those who say that the 2 hour mark is too long, it's really not. It built up perfectly and ended incredibly well."
1470,1.0,only because they decided to make a gadget to spin webs out of last time I will call is that Spiderman was bitten by a spider to make Spiderman and have spider powers not a machine on his wrist so this movie freaking sucks
1471,5.0,"I  Surprisingly  liked  it  more  then  i  thought  i  would,  Like  the  First  ""Amazing  Spider-man"" Film  it  has  a  great  sense  of  humanity  through  out  the  and  on  top  of  that  it  was  a  fun  action  film  too!  From  a ""Technical""  stand  point  the  film  is  amazing,  the  visuals  are  beautiful,  the  action  sequences  a  shot  with  incredible  skill,  in my personal opinion  the  action  sequences  in  this  spider-man film  blow  the  Raimi  films  out  of  the  water!  They  are  so  immersive  and  thrilling.  The  chemistry  between  Emma Stone  and  Andrew Garfield  is  just  so  adorable.  Some  of  the  problems  that  were  addressed by  other  people  are  understandable  but  honestly  the  to many  villains  thing  isn't  really  a  problem  because  rhino  isn't  in  the  film  long  enough  for  me  to  have  a  problem  with  him.  The  whole  of  the  film  was  always  about  the  fact  that  harry  osborn  has  come  back  and  the  relationship  between  him  and  peter,  but  where  i  think  sony  really  dropped  the  ball  was  removing  a lot  of  Dane  Dehaan's  scenes  those  scenes  were  freaking  incredible!  especially  the  deleted  scene ""Peter's Father""  that  was  so  emotional  and  they  took  it  out  why?!  On  top  of  that  where  in  the  hell  are  Shailene Woodley's  scenes?  why  aren't  they  in  the  deleted  scenes  ?  PLEASE  FOR  THE  LOVE  OF  GOD  RESTORE  THOSE  SCENES  TO  THE  FILM!  But  on  its  own  ""Amazing Spider-Man 2""  is  a  fun  action  film  if  you  are  worried  about  purchasing  it, it  is  currently  playing  on  ""Starz""  or  rent  it  honestly  i  enjoyed  it  for  what  it  was."
1472,1.0,"Depressing. Tedious. Overlong. Predictable. Nothing new under the sun. CGI overkill. I watched this whole movie from beginning to end, but with about seven or eight breaks in between, JUST TO WAKE MYSELF UP! **SPOILERs ** - Did we really need to resurrect Harry Osborn again? I mean enough is enough, and then to find out in the end that he's still alive and planning more mischief. BORING. Does every freaking Marvel movie that comes out now have to look like a two hour video game? I enjoyed the first entry into this new resurrection of the beloved Marvel character. We finally got to see Dr. Kurt Connors turn into The Lizard. But in this installment we started out well with a new villain-ELECTRO- but, SPOILER AGAIN - we go through a never ending CGI battle with him, put him down for a while and then, lo and behold, freaking Harry Osborn shows up and resurrects him again, and then of course we have to see the stupid GREEN GOBLIN show up all over again. Watching this reminded me of just how good the Sam Raimi films were- ALL 3 films (for those of you who didn't like #3) . FINAL **SPOILER** -The only potential ""fun"" character in this movie shows up at the end-Paul Giamatti as the Rhino - and he's only given about 2 minutes screen time. With the exception of a few wisecracks from Peter Parker, the rest of this movie plays out like a Dostoyevsky tragedy."
1473,3.0,"if you don't know anything about spider-man, you might love this movie..if you do know the history of spider-man then viewing it from a movie point of view directors doing whatever they want with no consideration for what actually happened in the comics it might be ok.

First off, Electro is the Red Skull's son, meaning he is a white german man with a german acsent, Red Skull created him, watcht he spider-man cartoon season 5 from the 90's they show the whole deal and it was awesome. In this movie, electro is black, crazy for spider-man and yet out of nowhere decide's he wants to kill spider-man which made no sense at all, how you look up to someone for saving you, they literaly only knock you out cause you attacking cops with electricity when you get shot..makes no sense...
..
Harry, don't get me started on Harry, he looks like Toby (the other spider-man actor from the first movies) in spider-man 3 when he had the black venom and gothic kind of look, why have harry look like that? what reason? it's so stupid, then his Father Norman Osborn actually dies, doesn't become the green goblin at all which is bull. Then harry becomes green goblin and kills gwen stacy but still he looked nothing like the green goblin, the cheapest green goblin outfit I ever seen in my life, some metal things for ears and around his face making no sense at all, the costume was so bad I cant even remember how it looks.

at least they did the death of gwen stacy which is the only reason this movie is getting 3 stars, otherwise 0.. she died in the comic a similar way, the only consideration these arrogant directors or whatever had for spider-man a comic book most likely older then they are..

it was stupid to have gwen stacy in the first movie before he got his powers ect... do mary jane then gwen stacy, whyc ant these idiots just make the movie the right way, the first spiderman with toby was beautiful, it actually related to the comic, here it's like do whatever you want and people will pay to see it cause the name spiderman is on it...

not to mention Rhino at the end, how stupid, rhino doesn't have a freaking suit like that, he has a rhino costume and is a huge man who could crush spider-man, they could have hired a wrestler like ""The Big Show"" for that."
1474,1.0,"wow what a rip off, are you serious? $4 to rent this for what 1-2freaking days? really?
when it is at redbox and you can rent it for $1 there, its like getting a $3 discount for driving down the street and picking it up at a redbox. so getting sick of amazon about to get rid of it soon anyway"
1475,5.0,"I'm not about to give you a review that tells what the movie is about because you can read on Amazon a plot line synopsis and many of the other reviews tell what the movie is about. Instead, I'm going to tell you in my review what the movie does for me and this is why I like the movie.

""Her"" is a film that like the petals on a rose, it has many layers:

1. A touchy-feely film that takes a look at one's inner most feelings. I do not mean any disrespect, but this is a film that most men would not like for that reason. If one is into the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator philosophy, one would say that the film's personality is an INFP. Some might say a too analytical investigation of emotions, over thought and over felt. Yet, it's the deep raw inner feelings that lay our souls bare, the exposed nerve of our inner core that I love about this film.

2. One might say this is a commentary on how our society is becoming far too dependent on technology. Such dependence leaving us emotionally crippled in a sterile environment surrounded by our own selves and lacking the ability to interact with others. The irony of Theodore's job as a professional letter writer, who writes deep heartfelt emotional letters for people is not lost on the viewer. Will we become a society that is so far removed from our feelings, so busy with our schedules, that we are incapable of writing our own letters, expressing our own emotions to our loved ones?

3. This film explores the age old question, ""What makes us human?"" Are we more than just our physical bodies? If we were to take our thoughts, our emotions, and our conscious awareness and place it into a computer, would then the computer be ""human""? The science of ""neural networks"" is becoming more and more of a reality as scientists and computer experts work together to achieve this type of ""immortality"". Which begs the question, ""If a deceased person's consciousness is transplanted into a computer or robot, does that make it a 'human' with rights?"" Just what is 'human'?

4. Is a virtual relationship ""real""? As more and more people get into computer dating and cybersex, we find ourselves asking this question. Virtual reality games are springing up all over the Internet. One that comes to mind is called, ""Second Life"". I personally know of people who have had virtual relationships in Second Life using avatars and either using the voice capabilities in Second Life to talk to each other, or they call each other on Skype while they watch their computer screen as their avatars ""make love"", a type of virtual reality cybersex-relationship that is becoming more and more common place. These people in Second Life, most, who have never met each other in person, claim their relationship is real and they are very much in love. But, when the computer is turned off, the person isn't there. Does our love just turn off and on with the flick of a switch? Can a virtual love, without the physical touch that seems to be so very much a part of a relationship, be satisfying enough? Is it really a relationship or is it merely a modern version of phone sex? Is it love? I've heard of true stories where people in a bygone era, would fall in love through letters. My own maternal grandparents did just that. So is it such a stretch of the imagination that we can fall in love virtually?

5. Can we love more than one person at the same time? Those who are in open marriages or open relationships claim that people are capable of having love, true romantic love, for more than one person at the same time. We see in the film how devastated Theodore becomes when he realizes he's ""just one of many"". We have all known or heard of people who have found out their loved one was cheating on them by finding a text message or an email. We all want to feel unique and special, but in an age when our technology makes it so very easy to have more than one relationship at the same time, we begin to question our heart's ability to withstand technological polygamy.

6. ""Her"" cuts to the quick, the bottom line being as human, as people, all of us basically want to be accepted for who we are, not judged and to be loved. Such basic human needs, that no matter how far removed our society becomes from a simpler, less technological age, we still are creatures that all need and want acceptance and love.

7. Is love just a biological chemical response or is it a deeper, transcendental, spiritual experience that goes beyond space and time? Love is more than just the scent of pheromones and the animal instinct to procreate. When we love, truly love, even after that person is gone from our life, our love still lives on. With each person who touches us deeply, they become a part of our soul. This film does not merely question love's transcendent nature, but stabs you in the heart with it as we watch the heart wrenching roller-coaster of emotions that Theodore experiences and as a result inevitably grows from it.

8. What constitutes being a ""god""? If we make a computer or robot that is capable of being self-aware, in essence it is a ""sentient being"", then does that make us ""god"" as its creator? Will we go from being ""God's creation"" to becoming gods ourselves with the development of neural networks that can think, reason and feel emotions?

9. And lastly, one can simply view this film as nothing more than just a very strange chick flick about relationships and breakups. But I doubt that the type of people this film appeals to would take such a narrow view of this work of art. And yes, in my opinion, this film is a work of art on many levels, between its cinematography, its music score and its ability to tell an entertaining and deeply moving story. By far, this is one of Joaquin Phoenix's best, showcasing his acting as a truly talented performer.

""Her"" is now on my top 10 list as one of my favorite films. However ladies, if you have a husband or boyfriend who's idea of a great film is Rambo First Blood, then you may have a difficult time selling him on the idea of going to see such a sensitive, emotional movie. I think this would be a great film as a ""girls' night"" movie. Ladies, wear your sweats, pop some popcorn, get out the chocolate bars and the tissues, gather up your BFFs and sink into the sofa, relax and watch this film together. You'll be glad you did.

UPDATE May 1, 2014 - Second viewing of the film:  OK, so I watched the movie a second time after reading all the other reviews here at Amazon. With the negative review points in my head as I watched the film for a second time, yes, the movie does have some rather creepy scenes. And now, come to think of it, this time around I kept reminding myself that as human as she sounds, Samantha is just a computer program so falling in love with her is well, really ridiculous. This time around I tried to place myself in Theodore's position and I realized that no matter how enduring and how much I seemed to bond with Samantha, given the situations Theodore was in, I still wouldn't have fallen in love because in the back of my mind, Samantha is just a very intuitive and clever computer program. I doubt I would have gone as far as Theodore did in sharing my personal emotions with Samantha. I would have kept the relationship on a purely professional level, that of a software owner and his software that provides itself as an electronic tool and organizer, similar to a boss and his administrative assistant. Other reviewers say that Theodore turning down Olivia Wilde and Portia Doubleday is ridiculous, but I don't think so. Olivia gets into the whole, ""I want a serious relationship"" after only meeting Theodore for the first time over drinks. To me, that's a huge turn off and pretty freaking scary. I think most people would run for the hills. Portia Doubleday, although very attractive, she's far younger than Theodore and a total stranger. For some men, this wouldn't be an issue. But perhaps Theodore is like my husband who has said that dating a girl much younger would seem like dating your daughter. Also my husband is an old fashioned kind of guy that needs to know a woman well and have an established relationship long before hopping in bed with her. Some men are like that and Theodore seems like that type of guy. So all those reviewers that criticize the movie script for having Theodore rejecting these women, claiming that a ""normal"" man would never turn these women down for sex, don't really view these scenes from the prospective of Theodore's nerdy nice guy personality and instead they are viewing these scenes and seeing them as if they themselves were offered sex with these women. Anywho...I still like the movie, ""Her"" and I still think it's as wonderful as I said in my previous review above, but I now am viewing it from a different angle and wanted to express my thoughts on this. I still recommend this movie. It definitely is a must see for those who are deep thinkers with strong emotions. Those looking for macho testosterone induced action films with car chases and lots of violence, best pass this movie up."
1476,3.0,"First the unrealistic parts:  1. You go to New York ( and you're a guy ) and a hot girl meets you there cause she's the recruiter :  Unrealistic.  It would either be a guy or an unattractive woman meeting you......likely a guy.  I get called by recruiters all the time and they're 20 - 30 somethings guys headhunting for commisions.  2. The hot girl is totally forward, friendly, waits all day for you to finish your interview so she can take you for a drink:  UNREALISTIC - in reality hot women are getting texts and phone calls on their cell phones 24 hours a day from all her male suitors she would already have because she's been living in that town for a while. So, tons of guys would be birdogging her and she wouldn't wait around for you ( a guy from out of town ) for any reason.  In the real world, hot women,like Mila Kunis are a commodity and highly sought after and usually already taken.  Also, in real life, men are the aggressors and women are more demure.  Men are like dogs and women are like cats....ie cats scare easy.  Men have to convince women to do things with them....get coffee or date.  In this movie, Justin t. has a don't give a $##$ attitude and is the one being pursued after by the hot girl.  Unrealistic....it's the other way around.  That's human nature.
  Justin Timberlake is so much more talented than John Mayer that he has seeming disdain for him in this movie:  UNREALISTIC - In reality John Mayer has more talent in one of his fingers than Justin T. has in his whole body.  John Mayer writes his own stuff....plays guitar like Jimmy freaking Hendrix and sings good.  Mayer's lyrics often have deep meaningful insights to life ( except for some of that obvious made for radio stuff....which I don't care for either )  Meanwhile what does TImberlake do?  Jump around on stage.....playing NO instrument....dressed in Shiny outfits and sing along to boy band songs.  Big freakin whup.  Mayer having disdain for Timberlake.....would make more sense.
  OK....there were some funny parts.....but the lack of what the real world is like in terms of human nature and the way women and men interact......blew it for me."
1477,1.0,"A presumptuous flop that never delivers.

This POS plays like a highly censored day school version of a screenply assignment penned during recess on the back of a used sanitary napkin.

After 42 minutes I could bear it no longer and just shut it down.

Here's why: awful script apparently written by people who have no idea about Reality, and under some sort of censorship to boot. Obvious scenes that could have made it credible were obviously rendered powerless.

CHARACTERS who freaking WHISPER gravelly sounding lines that I cannot freaking understand, but in an obviously pussy phoney way too dumb to even discuss.

The screenwriter, the director, the producers---EVERYone associated with this stomach-hurling BLAH, should be tarred and feathered.

And the ""3 star"" public---has NO freaking idea anymore what a good film is....

All hail the Millenial Revolution!"
1478,5.0,"This is the first movie I have found scary in the last ten years. The characters, as others have mentioned, are very believable and relatable, which makes it way more involving when stuff starts to go down.  The scares are more plentiful than in other PA movies. It doesn't just get scary the last few minutes (although those last few minutes are pretty freaking intense.  The story is more complex than in any of the other PA movies, and ties in the other films very effectively. I don't know why this was marketed just to Latinos.  Sure, the characters are all Latino, but they are well-developed and will appeal to people, especially younger people more familiar with any kind of non-suburban culture.  Highly recommended!"
1479,3.0,"This movie was obviously low budget, with only a few no-name actors, and the special effects were simple.
There was no blood or gore, so I would call it a thriller (not a horror movie) because it was suspenseful but not scary.
I enjoyed it and it held my attention.
It was slow moving, but that added to the suspense.
I really felt for Samantha's loss over losing her husband, and being lonely in a big house, and hating her job.
I loved the ending.

The one thing that really annoyed me about this movie was that the friend, Maya, asked Samantha about a dozen times if she should come over. Samantha kept saying no, but instead, she kept calling her and freaking out over the phone.  If I were Maya, only half an hour away in a car, I would have just gone over there, especially as it started getting later in the evening.

Samantha said that she had a long day of work the next day, but then, at the end, she finally told Maya to come over and that they could go dancing, and by this time, it was after midnight.  Samantha took sleeping pills, had taken off her make-up, was wearing sweatpants, and had been freaking out all night, and so it did not look like she was in any condition to go dancing, and certainly not to have alcoholic drinks after taking pills.

Maya was a good friend to her, lending her spiritual items, talking to her all night, being supportive and upbeat and understanding, and offering to come over."
1480,2.0,"There were some good and bad things about this movie. However, the bad does outweigh the good, in my opinion.

The good things:
This movie was more true to the book than the first movie. The cutting of Cathy's hair at the hands of Chris, as well as the hanging of their mother in the wedding dress being left out because it was never a part of the ending in the book.
This movie was more controversial than the first movie because they were bold enough to tackle the subject that was taboo in the first film.
Heather Graham made a good ""mother.""
Ellen Burstyn made a good ""grandmother."" I just wish she would have done more.

The bad things:
All of the children were horribly miscast, and all were equally terrible actors.
The ""grandmother"" was way too soft. Louise Fletcher was scary, mean, heartless, and she absolutely killed her performance.
This movie was so rushed that we were deprived of the small details that made the first film so creepy. We barely got to know anything about the twins and how close they were. We didn't get to see the little things like the gravedigger digging the graves, or the mother poisoning the cookies, or in this case, doughnuts.
The incest was apart of the book, and I applaud the fact that they weren't afraid to go there, but those scenes before and after were still cringe-worthy. They seemed proud of what they had done.
It seemed crazy to me to watch those kids come in and out of that room like it had a revolving door, while at they same time we are supposed to believe they were still helpless to leave when the older kids were still coming and going as they felt like it.
Cathy sneaking around and kissing her mother's boyfriend on the lips was stupid.
These kids were not actually locked inside the attic like the first movie.
I hated the ending because there was no justice for the Dollanganger children, and yes I have read the book, but I still didn't like that. Sometimes trying to make a movie too much like the book doesn't work, and in this case, it didn't. Their mother literally got away with murder.

That being said, I already acknowledged that this movie was like the book. Now, whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, depends on who you ask. I know that the mother was absolutely not hanged by her own wedding dress in the book, but that provided a type of closure that I liked to the first movie being that there were no sequels made. That part being left out of this movie, for me, only made the ending seem unfinished. It left something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the things that I found stupid about the book are the exact same things that I found stupid about the movie. You are welcomed to disagree all you like, but like I said, it was stupid. Cathy sneaking around kissing her mother's boyfriend, the key to the door, none of those scenes were in the first movie which made it more believable. Seriously...you and your siblings are being beaten and held captive, and all you can think about is what it's like to kiss a man on the mouth, so you do it...un-freaking-believable!

On top of that, I have a hard time believing that anyone is being held against their will when they have made a key to the damn door and they are going back and forth as they please. That's even more unbelievable now in 2014. In other words, despite what was in the first movie or the book, their captivity (if it could be considered that since they had a key) shouldn't have taken years, I don't give a flip about the mental as well as physical boundaries that kept them there, one of the twins died for no reason, and they could have left anytime they felt like it. Their mother actually let them out for the party, so it was clear she made no effort to conceal her true nature. Why would she let them out at her own engagement party so they could spy from an enclosed case inside the bar if they weren't even supposed to exist much less be seen? WTF! All of that was absurd!

It was just an okay Lifetime made for T.V. movie. I was disappointed really, and I couldn't wait to see it after I heard they were remaking it."
1481,1.0,"Drive a stake in the DVD box and toss it into the sunlight. What can I say, this movie bites....it sucks...ugh, I'll stop. This is a great example of The Hollywood Blender. Take Twilight and Harry Potter, pour into blender, mix on high for and hour and twenty minutes, and this is the crap you get. The only highlight of this movie is actress Zoey Deutch. I really liked her and found her interesting to watch. I just wish she were in a better movie. Okay, why is this move so bad? Well, its because there is NOTHING ORIGINAL HERE!
In Twilight, the vampires were hunted by the Voltori. In Vampire Academy, they are hunted by the Strigoi. Ugh! In Harry Potter: Camber Of Secrets, some mysterious person goes around killing small animals and hanging them up then writing threats on the wall in blood. Hey, guess what? The same freaking thing happens in Vampire Academy. REALLY? Exactly the same. Then to add insult to injury, some of the vampire castes can do ""magic."" They have ""powers."" I really am NOT making this up. Its Potter and Twilight, seriously. Skip this movie...please."
1482,5.0,"So this is going to a review of the actual event itself and of course not the DVD because it's not out yet.  As far as the event itself goes, I thought it was a really good event but also maybe the saddest WM of all time due to what happened at the event itself and also what has happened since the event has went off the air.  I also would like to say that I watched this on the WWE network and I have to say, it ran pretty good for me.  There was one pause that occured during the main event but all I did was rewind it like TiVo and start it again and it played well for me the rest of the time.

The event started with perhaps one of the greatest promos or interview segments in wrestling history as Hulk Hogan, the host of WM, came out to address the crowd.  He was on his game except for calling the Superdome the Silverdome (WM III) twice.  After he spoke for a moment then Steve Austin came out to also speak to the crowd and Hogan.  After he was done, then the Rock came out to speak as well.  I mean here you have maybe the greatest star of the 80's in the ring with the greatest star of the 90's and the greatest star of the early 2000's.  I watched with my brother and just said to him, ""Imagine if these guys were 100 percent.  Imagine that Triple Threat match.  After that we got a package showing all the events that led up to the Triple H vs. Daniel Bryan match up.

So the opening match was a great one between Triple H and Bryan.  I don't know if it beats the WM 10 match with Bret and Owen but if not it came pretty darn close.  This match was back and forth and Bryan was really on his game (pun intended) that night.  I don't remember the last time I saw Triple H in the opening match of a major PPV but he was on as well.  I figure the reason he went on first is so he had the rest of the show to make sure everything else went off without a hitch seeings as how he pretty much runs the WWE nowadays.  Great contest that goes a little over 25:00 and well worth the price of the event itself.

After this match we see The New Age Outlaws and Kane take on The Shield.  I, like most, thought the Shield would break up during this match but that was not the case.  The WWE made the Shield look very strong to the point that they defeated Kane and the NAO in just over 2:00.  This was a pretty good match.

After that there was a backstage segment with some of the WWE Legends like Ricky Steamboat and Ron Simmons and some others.  Once that was over it was time for the Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal.  First off, some of the guys that were originally supposed to be in the battle royal were not in it for whatever reason like Christian.  The eventually winner was a total surprise to me but man what a win for him as he actually scooped up the Big Show in a slam position and dumped him over the top rope to win.  This match was actually entertaining for a little over 13:00 and I was not expecting that.

After that we see all the events that led up to the Cena vs. Wyatt match and then it was the match itself.  First of all, I was kind of surprised that for the second straight WM Cena did not have a special entrance which is what he is usually known for.  Wyatt did have one and his was maybe the best entrance of the night.  The match itself was one of the best psychological matches I have ever seen.  It was back and forth and just a joy to watch.  The match went around 22:00 and while I thought it was good, I did think the wrong man went over.

So after that we see some of the segments of the Hall of Fame ceremony and then the intro of the Hall of Fame class of 2014 which featured Carlos Calone, Mr. T., Lita, Razor Ramon, Paul Bearer, Jake Roberts and of course the Ultimate Warrior.  The saddest part of this is knowing Warrior finally made it into the Hall and just days after taking his place we find that he has since died very suddenly.  In fact it was the day after his last appearance on Raw.  Very sad.  RIP Warrior.

After all of that we see the events that led up the Lesnar vs. Undertaker match.  What a freaking match with truly one of the biggest shocks in all of wrestling history.  I don't think I have ever witnessed 70,000 people take a collect gasp as they did when this match was over.  I know it's been all over the internet what with stories about it and some people actually have conspiracy theories about the match (for the love of God it was planned) so I think I can give the winner away.  Brock Lesnar does the unthinkable and actually ends the streak of Taker at 21 straight wins.  As I was watching and as I saw Brock hit his 3rd F5 on Taker I just knew Taker would kick out and hit a Tombstone and win for a 22nd time.  Never in a million years did I think the streak would end.  There are some that are saying that was Taker's last match and if it was, man what a hell of a way to go out.  For around 25:00 these two gave it their all and gave us a great contest.  Of course now the event is over we are finding out that Taker suffered a severe concussion and some possible minor neck injuries and that he collasped backstage once he left the ring.  For the first time in the history of WM Vince McMahon didn't see how the show ended because he elected to ride with Taker to the hospital.  WOW!

So after Taker and Brock successfully knocked the wind out of all of us, we got to witness the Vickie Guerrero Invitational for AJ Lee's Diva's title.  I'm not going to name everyone in it but there like 13 other Diva's in it.  The match was pretty good for a Diva's match and it was rather short clocking in at a little over 6:00.  Pretty good contest but honestly if there was one match to skip on this event, it would be that one.

After that match we get a backstage segment featured the participants of the first WM main event with Hogan, Roddy Piper, Paul Orndorff (who I didn't even recongize at first) and Mr. T.  They finally put their differences behind them.  Lastly, we get to the Main Event which would have Daniel Bryan factor into it now along with Randy Orton and Batista.  This was actually a really good contest with all 3 guys getting in all their patented moves.  There was one sick move where Batista set Bryan up for a powerbomb and he was lowering him for the boom, Orton flies in and catches Bryan with his RKO sending Bryan through the announce table.  Great match and a very satisifying ending about 8 months in the making.  We finally get the payoff we were looking for.

All in all, the event was one of the better WM's that I have seen in recent years with just about every match being better than what I thought it was going to be.  It was sad that Taker's streak had to come to an end, but you have to remember, Taker once did an interview where he stated he didn't want to be undefeated at WM.  That he didn't want his career to be based solely on that.  In fact, at one time, he wanted Kane to be the one to end it.  I do wish someone younger or someone more devoted to the business could have taken the streak but I'm not as disappointed in it as some people are on the internet.  I'm surprised that Brock hasn't gotten death threats yet!!  The business with Warrior is truly a sad thing to find out simply because of leaving behind his wife and two young daughters.  I never like it when kids are involved cause it just makes it even more worse.  Warrior should always live on in our hearts and minds.  Thank you for the matches you gave us Warrior and may you rest in peace finally.

This was a terrific event and one that I would actually give a 10 out of 10 to!  I can't wait till it is released and I can watch it again!"
1483,4.0,"If you like ballet barre exercising, you can't go wrong here.  Three different 20 minute workouts, they stand alone nicely or do a couple if you have the time.  I have to say I don't care for the mat portion but that's just me, it's a fine workout.  The cardio is great when you want to do that, I worked up a nice sweat (and it's really got a ballet feel) and my favorite is the barre portion, a really enjoyable 20 minutes that works me all over - arms, thighs, glutes.  I like Jessica, the background is different, don't love the disco classical music but I don't really care.  Exercise DVDs run the gamut from wow, this is way too easy to are you freaking kidding me?  I don't work at Cirque du Solei -  this one is great for beginners (who might need to work up to it, but that will come quick) and intermediates alike.  It's totally in my rotation, I can see me doing this often, and seriously who doesn't have 20 minutes?"
1484,5.0,great freaking film
1485,5.0,So freaking funny.
1486,5.0,"I bought this blu-ray having no expectations at all. I am just a long time Bruce fan somewhat disappointed by the way his career has turned. I played this show and I was hooked since the very beginning. I will admit I usually like covers, and in this case, I did like absolutely all of the tracks. Most of them are 4 stars or higher, and for my personal taste, the only two things I did not like that much were Emmylou Harris 'My Hometown,' and Mavis Staples singing in 'My City of Ruins' (the song, though, is top notch with a great Zac Brown and a very powerful gospel choir and excellent instrumentation throughout). I am sure every viewer will have his/her own picks. For me, the better moments of the night were Patti Smith's 'Because the Night' (so full of emotion, and beautifully sung), Mumford & Sons' 'I'm on Fire' (what a surprise, and what a great quartet these guys are!), Tom Morello & Jim James' 'The Ghost of Tom Joad' (I just LOVE Morello!!!!!). I also enjoyed Kenny Chesney's 'One Step Up' (that song is one of my personal favorites, and he did a great job!), and Juanes' 'Hungry Heart' (I was really surprised how he mixed Spanish and English, and the great rhythm he gave to the song hit). I was not very happy with Neil Young's 'Born in the U.S.A.' version, but I guess people think otherwise, considering the reaction (by the way, it is so freaking funny to see Neil Young 'playing' drums at the very end of the show, with the 'Glory Days' cast ensemble version!).
Because this was a TV show, you get the talking, the Springsteen reactions to his songs (this is very well captured, priceless for example when Patti Smith was on stage), and Bruce's speech, which I knew thanks to youtube and that you can have here for ever. A very good indeed speech Boss!
I give this 4.5 stars without hesitation, and I recommend it to anybody who likes Bruce or rock concerts."
1487,5.0,"DBZ freaking rocks! This blu-ray is fantastic. This also has the classic American Soundtrack which aired when it ran on Toonami, which is the one I actually liked. I tried the other audio track, and it just sounded straight-up out of place."
1488,1.0,"I'm a Jake Gyllenhaal fan, but I'm not a fan of this movie. I was also a literature and psychology major, so deep, elusive symbolism excites me.... this tale offers nothing but dark, uninteresting, disjointed segments with a few oddball, meaningless ""symbols"" thrown in to keep us thinking we're onto something if we just stay with it long enough. Not. I had to pause it about halfway through to make dinner, and afterwards realized I didn't care enough about how it came out to resume. There are just too many flaws in the plot to entice me to go along with it. I kept thinking that if I discovered someone who was my exact double, I'd be freaking out but in a good way, and I'd be telling family and friends, but these guys immediately panic and go all covert and secretive as if disaster has befallen them.......Why? Jake couldn't do much beyond the script he was given."
1489,5.0,"Chicago P.D. is one of the best cops shows in the last 15 years
It has elements from Homicide: Life on the Streets and The Closer/Major Crimes
with the look and feel of The Law and Order
It's very dark and realistic but, it never once goes over the top to the point of no return
It's paints the proper picture of cops in a major city trying to protect the people of there city!

Cast is strong (one of the best cast in terms of any police drama)
Jason Beghe  as  Hank Voight is what  Vic Mackey from the Shield should have been
Hank isn't clean by any means but, he does have a deep moral ground he's human not a stereotypical crooked cop!
Jon Seda  as  Detective Antonio Dawson  (It's good to see Jon playing a layered character he was good in Homicide: Life on the Streets but, he's grown and is a solid rock star on Chicago P.D.)
Elias Koteas  as  Detective Alvin Olinsky (Elias is freaking awesome in whatever he does he was Casey Jones in the original TMNT film it's cool to see him as this detective that's been through the mill and still tries to be his best!
Sophia Bush  as  Erin Lindsay  (A once bad girl that Hank took in and raised as his own daughter  Erin is very much Hank's daughter she has his drive and passion to be a good cop

Jesse Lee Soffer  as  Jay Halstead  (I mostly know his previous work in Mob Doctor and Lifetime's Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret tv movie he can act it's good to see him get a big break like this!

Patrick John Flueger  as  Adam Ruzek (most people who were fan's of USA's 4400 will know him)
Marina Squerciati  as  beat-cop Kim Burgess (I can see why she was cast she has those big Bambi eyes you are walking into this series with Kim being your point of view it helps she is a solid actress all around!
Laroyce Hawkins  as beat-cop Kevin Atwater  (Kim's partner)
Amy Morton as desk sergeant Trudy Platt  (Amy is really a amazing talent she's a hometown Chicago actress that should've broke out more and been more of a house hold name imo) she gets better with every episode
Stella Maeve  as  Nadia Decotis  (Erin's drug addict friend who wants to change and be better and she does anyone who watches C.P.D. loves Nadia for all the right reasons

If you love series like Law and Order, L&O: C.I. , Homicide: Life on the Streets, Major Crimes it's on the same amazing level
Dick Wolf has the golden touch and knows how to write series about a profession that really gets no respect mostly due to News outlets
Great Series all around 5 Star Cast, super HQ action scenes, perfect writing there's a reason Chicago P.D. has already been renewed for a fourth season!  One of the Best NBC's exclusives  10/10"
1490,5.0,"I wasn't sure what to expect since the quality of Scooby-Doo direct-to-DVD releases can vary pretty widely.  On ""family movie night"" my kids (4 and 7) really wanted to rent this and I reluctantly (due to the price) agreed.  I actually enjoyed watching it quite a bit (which, as we all know, isn't always the case with kids' movies).

This definitely tweaks the standard Scooby format a bit and it seemed like a breath of fresh air in a semi-stale franchise to me.  It's high-tech and opens with Daphne doing a video webcast in which the rest of the gang interrupts.  The opening credit sequence is new and has a CSI-ish vibe to it.  The animation is darker but on-par with other recent favorites such as Legend of the Phantosaur.

The mystery is actually legitimate and isn't obvious from the start (like Scooby plots are prone to being).  There is enough danger and spookiness to keep kids entertained but nothing too scary or violent.  There is also enough slapstick humor to add levity to every scene.  If you are a family of Scooby fans, you will enjoy this movie.

<Semi-Spoiler Alert>I was worried about it promoting a negative body image for women based on another review about Daphne being turned in to a ""size 8"" and her freaking out about it.  I actually have to defend the writers here because Daphne realized she was being superficial throughout that story arc, it added to the story in a meaningful way (it allows her to evade iron face) and the most importantly: Fred didn't notice/care and said that she ""always looked good to him"".  I would say it was more about acceptance and not being superficial than anything.</Semi-Spoiler Alert>"

YES...It is VERY cheesy, I watched it like I would a spoof movie and it was freaking awesome! There are some parts where you are cracking up laughing cause of some pf the stupid things said. The girls were cute as well as the guys (most of them anyways), the CG was decent, there is A LOT of blood, you can tell it's fake but they use it like it will dry up tomorrow! There are a few jump out at you moments but that had me wondering when the next one will be (i'm a HUGE adreanlie junkie!)
THE ENDING....It didn't at all take me by surprise! They extend it after a few seconds of credits (4 years later)."
1495,5.0,"Pure visual poetry.  One of the most interesting and memorable movies I have seen in a long time.  Rented it, then bought it so I could watch it again and again.  The director is to be applauded for a bold, consistent, artistic vision.  Very, very different from the book, almost unrecognizable... more like an extremely poetic metaphorical interpretation of the book.  I watched this movie immediately after viewing the pile of stale garbage that is the new Godzilla movie, and after watching Under the Skin, I thought to myself, ""Now THERE'S a freaking movie!!!"""
1496,1.0,"Wasted time that I will never get back, plus l paid the rental fee. So, it was movie night and we chose to see this. My hubby and I were flipping through the new releases and saw this one. We are both sci-fi nuts and it was described as a sci-fi thriller, plus it has Scarlet Johannson, we thought ""what could be better?"" Well anything else would have been better! We know sci-fi's and thrillers sometimes get a bad rap..we kept expecting it would turn around, we were wrong. If I could have given it 0 stars, I would have. This movie is about a woman that drives around and seduces men. She takes them back to her ""other worldly lair"" to suck them dry. Literally, that is it, I promise there isn't anything else! Watch the trailer...now, watch the trailer again...keep watching the trailer...now, do that for almost 1.5 hrs and that's the movie!

Scarlett J is such a freaking sexy woman, especially when she smiles or kicks butt. She is so sexy, that I would leave my hubby and be with her! Unfortunately, she didn't float my boat in this film...I do not think that was her fault, at all!

Then, we get to the end and find out it's based on a book...OMG, DON'T DO IT!

Please heed the warnings...it's not even worth it to watch this movie for free."
1497,3.0,"Do you want to know just how much people still care about the Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles? When it was announced that Michael Bay would merely be producing a new film featuring everyone's favorite pizza-eating turtles it sent fans spiraling into Crazy Town. They couldn't believe how Bay, again only in a producer role, was going to ruin their childhood favorites. To be fair, we've seen what Bay did to Transformers and purists hate those movies with the heat of a thousand suns. But the worst thing that can happen is to have nobody really give a darn, and obviously that was not the case here. But Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is a co-production between Bay's Platinum Dunes and Nickelodeon, isn't quite the disaster many expected it to be.

So that might not be the most ringing endorsement and probably won't get plastered in TV ads (""It's not so bad""--Travis Hopson, Punch Drunk Critics), but really that is the only criteria that matters when it comes to a movie like this. We already know it will be geared towards kids and the storyline will be ridiculous. Plus, let's be really honest here, the TMNT have undergone so many changes over the years that picking one version as definitive is sorta silly. After toying with the far-out notion of turning them into extraterrestrials, Bay and Liebesman have stuck to a fairly traditional take on the Turtles, one that longtime fans can appreciate if they don't mind the kiddie tone.

New York is under attack by an evil paramilitary organization known as the Foot Clan, led by a metal-clad ninja called Shredder. Of course, this having Bay's stamp of approval Shredder looks like the spawn of Optimus Prime and a cheese grater. On the tail of the secretive Foot is lowly TV reporter April O'Neil, played by former Bay frenemy Megan Fox. O'Neil can't get anyone at her network to believe her about the Foot, but she has a more difficult time convincing them she saw four giant vigilante turtles fighting back. Fortunately, she finds a willing ear in scientist Eric Sachs (William Fichtner), a friend and colleague of her late father. What she doesn't know is that Sachs is holding on to a dark secret, one that threatens her and Turtles' future.

Chances are you'll figure out where this plot, cobbled together from dozens of other blockbusters, is headed in the first ten minutes. But getting there does prove to be more fun than expected, largely due to a script that understands the relationship between the turtle siblings and Splinter (voiced by Tony Shalhoub), their overgrown rat sensei. Raphael is a hot-headed jerk, Donatello is a dork with a bo staff, Michelangelo is a laid back beach bum, while Leonardo (voiced by Johnny Knoxville) is the born leader. Conflicts arise amongst the group, particularly between Raph and Leo, while Mikey acts like a clown. What doesn't work so well is in the physical design of the Turtles. They are freaking massive, huge bulked-up creatures and it takes away from their supposed ninja abilities. Are we truly expected to believe they were able to be stealthy all these years fighting in the shadows? They're the size of Monster Trucks! It's absurd, and it clashes against the idea of them as teenagers. Granted, watching them zip through the sewers on skateboards, along with a healthy dose of childish fart humor, does a pretty good job of establishing their immaturity. Kids will eat that stuff up. Adults? Eh, maybe. They may also find Mikey's crush on April a little too mature (and weird) for kids to handle.

Through the alien war flick Battle: Los Angeles and Wrath of theTitans, Liebesman has established himself as a director whose style resembles that of Bay in just about every way. So it's no shock that visually this looks exactly like Transformers; big chaotic action that defies the laws of physics but looks amazing. The highlight is a 10-minute chase down a snowy slope with exploding trucks, Turtles on the half-shell, and Fox hanging for dear life. It looks amazing, although it doesn't make a lot of sense logistically. Why is there so much snow there but nowhere else in the city? We're probably not supposed to notice. Other plot holes will rear their ugly head, too, as the villains' main scheme makes absolutely no sense when revealed. This was a case of the writers' going too far in wanting a huge world-threatening finale when nothing we've seen up to that point suggests it should be the case. What you won't find is much in the way of emotion except in the brotherly camaraderie between the Turtles, and that is displayed mostly in broad strokes.

Despite their hulking size, the CGI Turtles look pretty good although the effects get a little sloppy during the faster fight sequences. Fox is back to her old bag of tricks as little more than a pretty face. She gets a lot of reaction shots and not much else to do, but at least she wears O'Neil's classic yellow jacket! Will Arnett gets a few laughs as her cameraman and potential suitor, Vernon Fenwick. Fichtner is so good at playing quirky, mannered bad guys that it's disappointing he's so boring here. Sachs just isn't written to be a funny character and it's a waste of what Fichtner does best. Somebody should have shown these guys Fichtner's Drive Angry highlight reel.

So you may not be shouting ""Cowabunga"" but at least it's not 'The Secretof the Ooze'. There aren't any Vanilla Ice cameos to speak of and that's automatically a good thing. As an introduction to younger audiences and an action-packed slice of nostalgia, you could do worse than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."

1500,3.0,"I would say this was a 2 1/2 star movie.  Fantastic performances all around, great idea...first half of the movie was so great I thought I was watching one of those sleeper hits that no one heard of in the U.S.  Problem comes in the second half of the movie.  Kind of a mess...some interesting ideas but I feel it needed an editor to go back and redo the 2nd half of the screenplay.  The structure of how the train was set up didn't make much sense.  I didn't expect them to go through every train car as that had to be hundreds of them.  SPOILER:  However, I don't think it would be a good idea to put a night club car where everyone is getting drunk and high on drugs right next to the main engine room...Also, they want to blow a hole in the train to get into the wilderness because they think the snow is melting yet it's still a freaking ice age outside. You better have a plan for when you get outside or you are going to freeze to death seeing there are no structures for you to take shelter in  Oh yeah, it was lucky they had a children size snow coat available at the end for the kid that lived....just a few examples.  END OF SPOILER.  The movie wasn't perfect, I only felt let down with the second half of the movie after how great it started."
1501,5.0,"Jason Bateman is a genius! Not only does he give a knock-out, outrageous, and deliciously wicked performance but he also directed this dark comedy. The writing is whip-smart and completely original. I feel like Bateman should've received more praise for ""Bad Words"". Kathryn Hahn (I love her) is also hilarious in this film as a reporter. I just love the whole ""Don't look at me!"" bit she does. Rohan Chand who plays Bateman's spelling bee rival (and friend), Chaitanya is so freaking adorable and hysterical as well. Bateman and Chand's chemistry is real and playful. You can tell they had fun making this movie. I hope Bateman continues to direct but I must say, his acting really blew me away here. He's so funny. His comedic timing is scary good. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE ""Bad Words"". I highly recommend it. Enjoy!"

1503,1.0,"Horrible and stupid movie.  One actor in the whole thing, and the whole movie takes place in a car.  Locke has a very important project to complete the next day at work, but he jumps in his car to be with the woman who he's seen only one time, but is having his baby.  This is not compassion and sensitivity, it's selfishness.

 It's not realistic, but ok, let's go with it.  He drives all night handling phone calls from his wife, whom he just admitted the infidelity this night on the phone.  Yeah that's right, he never did tell her about it and on the eve he's driving to the woman having his baby, that's when he tells her...and on the phone.  Everyone on the project at work is freaking out because he's a key component to getting it done right, but he's on the way to be with the woman he's only seen once, have his baby.

The movie presents Locke as a man who is willing to throw it all away to ""do the right thing"".  But the real reason he's doing it is out of an unhealthy resentment for his father, whom he screams at in the car, as if his ghost is listening.  His father apparently walked out on him or something.  The bottom line is he's not thinking right.  He's has his priorities backwards because he's using this act of driving to this woman to rub in his dead father's face in it.  ""Look at me dad, I don't walk away from my life's mistakes.""  --No, the guy actually is walking away from his family and....well, everyone with whom he's had loving relationships and to whom he has obligations.  There's no reason he couldn't have been there for the woman the next day.  He could have even told his wife face to face before leaving."

1505,3.0,"First, I have to say that I'm a HUGE Seth MacFarlane fan.  Aside from a couple of 'laugh out loud' scenes, I was really disappointed in this movie.  At first, it was trying WAY too hard for a laugh.  Once it settles in though, it's 'ok'.  I was expecting a whole lot more from Seth.  I enjoyed TED more than I thought I would, yet this one, less.
The music scenes are great, MacFarlane usually excels with these.  All in all, I thought the movie was worth the rental if only for the 'freaking out' scene.  But I shy from purchasing the DVD for my collection due to it's stupidness."
1506,5.0,"I think the people who didn't like this movie don't like Seth MacFarlane. The thing is, he does excellent work and A Million Ways to Die in the West is one of them. A hilarious cast makes this one funny film, yet, as is common with MacFarlane's shows and films, there is some sweet, heartfelt moments midst the poop and fart jokes.  Yeah, the jokes can sometimes approach the line and then cartwheel over it, but fans of MacFarlane have come to expect that.

As for the film's quality? This is a gorgeous movie.  Beautiful landscape shots make this one to own on bluray for sure.  The score is fantastic, calling back to many western themes that came before it, but bringing it's own quality at the same time. I don't care what anyone says, MacFarlane makes a great leading man. Charlize Theron is... well, I mean, she's Charlize freaking Theron, so she's amazing, of course!  Neil Patrick Harris, Sarah Silverman, Liam Neeson and Giovanni Ribisi all contribute mighty performances in supporting roles. And don't get me started on all the cameos, especially the unnecessary but wonderful throwback to... you know, what, I'm not going to spoil it.  Just know that there is a really great throwback to another movie.

Bottom line, if you like Seth MacFarlane and get his humor, you'll enjoy the flick.  You know who you are.  If, like my parents, you hated Ted (Seriously, Mom, I could have told you you wouldn't like it!) then MacFarlane's follow-up probably won't win you over, but if you skip this, you'll be missing out."
1507,5.0,A great movie. Really enjoyed and found extremely funny. Would not recommend for young children due to language and sexual content.  What a fun funny movie.  Punny at times. Quirky a lot. But meant to be that way. A few things went a bit too far but ah well it was freaking funny. If you liked Police Squad (I did) or Airplane (I did) then like me you will Love this movie. If you did not like these movies your sense of humor will not be suitable for this movie and you should just skip it.
1508,5.0,This movie is freaking great. MacFarlane never fails to be hilarious. Liam Neeson is in it--hotness overload--is there any other reason so see it? No. No there is not. Saw it in theaters. I died laughing. They had to resuscitate me. Think I'm lying? Then you're a nosy freak and who cares what you think anyway. Can't wait to see it. Again.
1509,3.0,"Oh dear, dear where should I start? Most through the movie I was so freaking annoyed. Why because if you are gonna do some major tornado disaster movie setting in the Midwest especially Oklahoma where thats where tornadoes are....why do you have a high school have their graduation outside let alone that day when you know its coming?!?!?!.....Not only is that so unrealistic because it would be a liability risk but also just plain damn stupid. Whoever freaking wrote the script or whatever sure NOT from the Midwest and than have a girl ask, ""whats that noise?"" when the tornado is coming like you hear that s*** miles away and there has been warnings all day about a storm and you ask that? Ummmm.....stupid. IF you were gonna have this disaster movie in a different state where tornadoes are uncommon and to have the graduation part and the girl ask that question than I can see the story being better....and than theres two drunken idiot, jackass wannabes.....
The graphics are very very good and after awhile you get less annoyed and more into the scene and your heart is racing and start to be like yes this movie is so good.....until the last minute where the drunken idiots are alive in the trees while Pete is dead who was in that tank of a vehicle....how the freak does that work??? again stupid....if they were trying to get some comedic relief with those guys they freaking failed miserably. nothing funny about that.
In all seriousness if you take out the drunken idiots and the unrealistic plot of people in OK seeming to not know a thing about tornadoes and to be stupid and have their graduation and to have it outside on top of it, than its a pretty damn good movie... or if it was set in a different state i think it would have been a lot more better because I know I'm not the only one that will probably be annoyed with it.....
If you can get past the story and be amazed by the graphics and the atmosphere that brings and get into the movie that way, its so much more better and than worth it....thats why its in the middle for me!"

1511,3.0,"Unfortunately this sequel to the excellent ""Taken"" (2008) provides little new and is certainly inferior to the original.  In this Olivier Megaton directed money grab, Liam Neeson remains effective as a former government secret agent.  In the original, he goes after Albanian goons involved in the sex trade.  They made the mistake of kidnapping Bryan Mill's (Neeson) teen age daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) which put Bryan in full on battle mode where he is able to use ""his special skills.""  This time, Kim's is still a teenager trying to pass her driver's license exam after a couple failures.

As an aside, I'm a big fan of the TV show ""Californication"" and 29 year old Maggie Grace has her own ""special skills"" in her role as a rock `n roll groupie in the recent season.  For her next role maybe she can play a high school student on ""Glee.""  Anyway, even if Kim can't parallel park, she can sure drive the hell out of a Mercedes cab, complete with a manual transmission.  Hard to focus on the plot, or lack thereof.

Bryan is on assignment in Turkey and the Albanian head of the family, Murad Krasniqi (reliable Rade Serbedzija), is out for revenge.  He and his henchman travel to Istanbul and get a bonus in that Kim and Bryan's ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) meet him there.  This time Lenore and Bryan are kidnapped and Kim must play a key role in getting them rescued.  There's nothing overly offensive except the script, especially some of the dialog.  Like ""Kim, drive faster"" or ""Kim, go go go"" and of course Kim freaking out.  There was no need to make this more-of-the-same movie except for box office receipts of course."
1512,1.0,"Thanks to the first film of the TAKEN series, under the auspices of 20th Century Fox, Liam Neeson as butt-kicking ex-spy Bryan Mills has successfully rebranded himself as one of the elder statesman of action cinema, now able almost to be spoken in the same sentence as names like Willis or Stallone. Then after that came a series that should have pushed the point home that he didn't belong there, with films like THE A-TEAM and UNKNOWN, which were both terrifically bad films. Unfortunately, he reteamed with A-TEAM director Joe Carnahan for THE GREY, an existential survival thriller that was well-received amongst fans and not unliked by critics. So, the Neeson Express was still rolling, and Fox, never knowing when to let a good idea lie (see the ALIEN, PREDATOR or DIE HARD series for evidence of this), decided to try to create a franchise out of what could only really succeed as a one-off. This led us to TAKEN 2, and what is one of the most boring, most unentertaining and really, one of the stupidest films of the year.

Basically, the film revolves around Mills' recently-divorced ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen, reprising her role) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, also reprising her ageless role) surprising him in Istanbul very shortly after he's concluded his protection service there. At the same time, the father (the wasted character actor Rade Serbedzija) of the ""Good Luck"" Albanian who Mills let fry in the chair from the first film, has sworn vengeance on Mills and his family. But instead of the daughter being taken, it's him and his wife. And Kim is the only one that can assist her father. And through a series of increasingly implausible scenarios, Mills takes the bad guys on to save his ex-wife.

I know that some people felt that there could never be a sequel to a film like DIE HARD because of how singular that film felt. Four sequels later, they're still expanding the idea to a fault. Well, TAKEN, because of its specific plot (kidnapped daughter), can really only work once, and as evidenced by this film, it's true. Bryan Mills, while being a badass, is little else. His motivations to save the wife of his ex-wife, who seems very keen on rekindling their relationship after her latest marriage ends, seem much weaker than a father protecting his daughter, and his pursuit of their assailants seem much more languid and rote. This is obviously a film that is going to hold no surprises, and to be honest, that should be enough. But the direction by French-director-with-the-greatest-action-film-director-name-ever, Olivier Megaton (TRANSPORTER 3, COLOMBIANA) is, similarly to his previous work, pretty uninspired and has no real excitement or vitality to it. Even the ""final fight sequence"" is dull and unimpressive. Neeson is just going through the motions here. I appreciate that actors are working people, and that they need to get some change in their pockets, but Neeson must have turned down better films than this. Janssen just exists to look nearly unconscious through most of the film, and Grace, who I really loved on LOST, and thought she was a lot of fun in the film LOCKOUT, has an expanded role here, but still makes not much of an impression. Plus, how old is she supposed to be? In LOST, she seemed to be in her early to mid-twenties, but in these films, she seems to be in her teens, and it really doesn't work.

I'm going to perhaps spoil something here, so you might want to not continue reading if you don't want to know more about the most idiotic point of the film. The film opens with Bryan looks to give his daughter driving lessons since she keeps flunking the parallel parking part. Of course, this means that a certain part of the film will require her to drive. When we get to this film's been-done-a-thousand-times-before car chase, she is inexplicably behind the wheel and instead of there being any beats where she is driving the car poorly, or is freaking out because she can't get the car in gear, she is driving this car like Jason Bourne on a bottle of No-Doz. She is doing things with a six-speed manual transmission that master stunt drivers would be envious of. And the finale of this chase scene culminates with Bryan instructing his daughter to drive DIRECTLY THROUGH the gates of the American Embassy without stopping, assuring that 50-caliber machine guns and other weapons begin firing at the car. And you know what? That's not even the stupidest part of the scene. It's when Bryan makes a call to one of his stateside spy buddies that puts an ignominous cap on this frighteningly moronic scene.

If I didn't think that TAKEN 2 was a bad idea before I saw it, I can guarantee to you now that it's a way of wasting valuable time that you will never get back. Skip it."
1513,2.0,Leslie Mann needs to add some more acting ability instead of whinning and crying.  That got freaking annoying to much of it.
1514,4.0,"The older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows (more low than high lately), the more I gravitate to these type of quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"".  The stories and characters just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Its like they opened up a new world to me and made me realize its ok to just be myself, not some ""normal"", soulless, successful, macho, ""alpha male"" cliche.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best, in their own messed up way, to make sense of and survive this Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society and scary world of ""normal"" people and ""grown-ups"" ::shudder::.  Sign me up.  My kind of people.

Unfortunately, while this movie was good, Jonathan Tropper's novel that this is based on is much better (seriously, its freaking hilarious, as are all his books), so if I had to recommend between the 2, I'd say check out the book and then, if you liked it, maybe check out the movie.  But I think there's a lot better ""dramedies"" out there that are more worth your time.  Just seemed so rushed compared to the book (though I understand you can't fit everything or even most things when adapting a novel into a movie).  But yes, I do like and relate to stories about human, quirky, flawed characters and this still wasn't bad.  So even if you don't want to check out the book, if anyone out there (of all ages) has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd recommend this movie to you, my fellow misfit and kindred spirit :)  If you agree with my review at all, you can mostly find me these days at twitter dot com/ShyLivesMatter Peace :)"
1515,2.0,"Moms' Night Out could have been so much more.  It's about a group of young mothers who struggle with the daily life of raising their kids and become stressed out as a result, so the husbands decide to participate in a little babysitting while the mothers go out on the town for a night of fun.  The mothers knowing what their husbands are like alone with the kids, and how some of them never grew up with their little video game obsession, are strongly against the idea.  However the fathers eventually take care of the kids for the evening anyway.

The concept sounds exhilarating right?  I mean what can go wrong?  It's about kids walking all over the men with tons of hilarious moments along the way... at least, that's what *should* have happened.  Instead we ever hardly see the kids/fathers misadventures at all.  Instead we get weak and rushed writing, and a pitiful attempt to deliver in the storytelling which just about destroys this film for the first half.  Thankfully it picks up during the final 30 minutes.  The first 20 minutes are quite brutal though.

The biggest problem I found with the film is that there's no excitement or memorable/coherent storyline at all pertaining to the most crucial part of the plot- that being the fathers failing to take care of the kids for the night.  To make matters even worse, when the kids eventually turn up missing due to the incompetence of the husbands, nothing funny or interesting occurs so why should *we* care if the kids disappear?  The storyline throughout the movie focuses mainly on the mothers wandering around town and freaking out over the whereabouts of the one mothers baby which abruptly cuts short their night of fun.  Too bad- the part where the mothers visit a restaurant and start a fight with the waitress behind the desk had potential.  Instead this scene (and the whole movie for that matter) feels weak and too girly.  The father with the bird problem in the car didn't help matters.  That whole scene was just awful to watch.

For some reason the writing does whatever it can to avoid showing the exciting parts of the husbands being bad parents, so it's more like the husbands call the mothers and say there's been a problem and now the kid is missing.  The movie fails to show us what happened and instead explains it through phone conversations.  So don't expect any Adventures of Babysitting type storyline (classic 1987 comedy that I must have watched 10 times).  Oddly, as I mention in the previous paragraph, the writing mostly centers around the women and their reactions to the men screwing up a simple babysitting job and significantly less on the kids.  Perhaps the writers thought the mothers perspective would be the more humorous and noteworthy aspect, but sadly almost none of the characters are memorable at all so it fails.  I'd have rather been watching the fathers reactions to their inability to babysit the kids.  I'm pretty sure most people feel the same way.  Then again for some mysterious reason this *is* a highly rated movie here on amazon so maybe not.

Moms' Night Out is also a victim of a constantly fast-moving pace, but failing to deliver with the laughs and enticing storyline because instead of fully carrying out each segment, it immediately shifts into another direction/segment.  The movie flows at a speed that's quite difficult to keep up with, and the weak writing certainly doesn't encourage me to keep up with it either.

To give a compliment, the movie *does* finally improve in the second half.  When the situation becomes too much to handle and the fathers (and mothers) ends up in jail pertaining to a variety of unfortunate circumstances, the pace dramatically slows down and allows time for the characters to be more memorable.  The writing improves too.  I even feel emotional when the moment calls for it, and the laughs get better too.  The movie writer who worked on the comedy did a poor job, but the writer who focused on the emotional side did a decent job.  Also I enjoyed the characters of the British taxi driver with a bad attitude, the clueless tattoo worker and the tall biker dude who actually delivers an emotional and memorable scene near the end when the one woman breaks down and convinces herself that she's a bad mother.

So basically the first half is total filler while the second half is an improvement.  I can't recommend Moms' Night Out due to so many problems.  The writing is way too similar to a romantic comedy which makes it hard to find anything funny about it, the writing doesn't stand out until it's almost too late, and it's just not very good.  Patricia Heaton is a good character as one would expect given her experience in other memorable roles (like yeah, Everybody Loves Raymond) but everyone else?  Completely forgettable.  You can't have the entire cast of main characters awful with the exception of one person.  I say only watch if you're having trouble finding something else."
1516,5.0,"OH MY STARS!!! We have never laughed so hard. I received this movie as a birthday gift from my best-friend who insisted I needed to see it. I had an entirely different movie in mind when she described it. We had no idea what we were getting into when we clicked play. At first, we thought, ""Okay, this is interesting"" (as in ready to hit stop and pop in an action movie) but by the end of the movie we all were laughing with tears in our eyes. It is definitely a slapstick, feel good, crazy, totally fictional, no way it's going to happen in real life movie. It's good clean family fun perfectly fine for everyone. Our teens (13-16) laughed right along with us. Definitely a must see, must buy, must share movie! Yes, it does have a religious theme, but it isn't in your face. It definitely celebrates motherhood - although as I said before, it blows it to the extremes. (Which is why it's so freaking funny!) I rate this movie up with ""Almost Heroes"", ""Dodgeball"", ""Out Cold"", ""R.V."", ""Old Dogs"" and ""Wild Hogs"" -- although without the adult content."

He finds this couple demonologists who I think were actually using that as a cover, anyways at their house in the creepy basement would make the Marque Desade say WTF? they tie Michael down on the floor and do a black magic ritual summoning a very powerful demon. Meanwhile he is learning albeit the hard way that yes they are very real exist and are terrifying as the demon slowly takes possession of his body

There is also this creepy twisted thing Michael and an undertaker do with occult experimenting but I'm not gonna give a lot of details don't wanna ruin it, but a hint won't hurt human teeth are used with other things. They do a weird ritual in of all places a cemetary, the folks buried there must be saying are you freaking kidding me?

1520,4.0,"Decent movie with a new twist that's satisfyingly original enough to have kept me interested throughout the film. The only problem was that it could have been more horrific. As a huge fan of tastefully done mind blowing horror films (Rare... The Ring, Dawn of the Dead, The Exorcist, Carrie, etc... are examples of fantastic horror films that are in the genius category of freaking people out, like great roller coaster rides...), I'm finding that they are still getting made, but have been always hard to make. Gimmicks aside, this film did the smart thing which is to keep the viewer wondering just how far this ""trip"" would go. For that, I at least applaud the efforts of everyone involved in making this film. Could trying harder at using the fear factor of the horror film genre have gone farther? Yes. And it's too bad it didn't, but, well, as I said, great films, in general, are very rare and hard to make. Originality, true suspense, great themes, etc... are very hard to always come through for any film fan. But, this film did try and for that it gets four stars."
1521,4.0,"Back in the '90s, Solondz was one of a pack of up-and-coming American indie directors, along with the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Kevin Smith, Richard Linklater and Todd Haynes. After getting a lot of acclaim for his portraits of twisted ""losers"" in ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Happiness""-- one of the decade's defining films --  he slowly fell out of favor. In fact, you could probably trace the rise of the word ""comfortable"" in American English -- as in ""I'm not comfortable with that"" -- over the arc of Solondz' fall.

The consensus view of his work started to shift with 2001's ""Storytelling"", which featured a notorious scene with Robert Wisdom and Selma Blair that seemed designed to make people's heads explode. Where his portraits of Middle American Ugly were once viewed as wickedly transgressive, now that he trained his eye on issues of race and political correctness, Solondz was branded a misanthrope, a miserabllist, a hater.

As far as I can see, he's never changed a bit. Behind his slightly nerdy demeanor -- thick rimmed eyeglasses, button-down shirts, and shock of gray hair -- lies the heart of a punk, someone who's certain that society is filled to the brim with hypocrites, phonies, bullies, whack jobs, and brown-nosers, seething with narcissism, self-loathing, and toxic passive-aggression.

The brilliance of Todd Solondz is his ability to make you laugh at the most inappropriate moments, then make you feel dirty about it one beat later. That's certainly true of the director's latest, ""Wiener Dog"", which features a cute little dachshund in the title role, but dog lovers expecting another ""Marley and Me"" will probably leave the cinema calling for the director's head.  Four interlocking stories show the dog pass through the  hands of four generations of owners: a child with cancer  and stressed, overprotective parents;, a young adult who seems pretty aimless in her life, and hits the road with an old flame;  a university film school prof who's quite burned out, and a sour old lady who's getting hit up for money by her granddaughter.  If you crossed the gentle moralising of  Eric Rohmer with the sick jokes of John Waters, you might end up with this. I laughed long and hard, but some people would  call me a bad person for that.  Such is life; Solondz is laughing at the void, whereas most people just don't even want to think about it. It  makes them, well, ""uncomfortable"".  If the very use of that word drives you up the freaking wall, you will love Todd's movies."
1522,1.0,"Oh my God. This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Im making sure to post this review both on Amazon AND on IMDB. I have no doubt in my mind a fair amount of drugs were involved in the creation of this artistic screenplay

First of all, this movie isn't about a dog, its about death/mortality. After reading the description I was expecting a sort of My Dog Skip or even canine Black Beauty type movie. What I got was a disjointed, dark film that left me staring at my screen in disbelief.

I don't know what was more disturbing, the scene where a mother was telling her young son the story of her childhood dog being raped by a greasy stray named Mohammed (wtf?), the 2 minute montage of bloody diarrhea, the scenes of Kieran Culkin being a drug addict that seemed sadly realistic, Ellen Burstyn chugging a whole bottle of Kaopectate, or the fact the dogs names throughout the film were just Wiener Dog, Doody and Cancer.

Seriously, only the dogs scenes with her first owners (mostly mistreating her) in the first 15-20 mins actively involved the dog as a part of the film. Throughout the other hour she was barely more than a prop. They could have replaced the dog with a stuffed animal or even a freaking lamp that was passed around and the majority of the movie would have been the same. Not only that but it seems that past the first three owners of the dog, the film makers didn't seem to feel the need to explain how the dog was given to the next owner or the next, she just magically appeared beside new people with no rhyme or reason as to how she got there.

The film is full of weird, creepy and awkward scenes, many of which involve painfully long shots of boring or gross things (like previously mentioned diarrhea), or the dog doing nothing but looking uncomfortable in a cage. And lets not forget that despite having at least 3 good actors, the vast majority of the cast was godawful. I also feel like they directed any children in this film to be as creepy and weird as humanly possible. There were a few times I laughed, Ill admit. But it was less Hah! Thats funny! and Thats so messed up I have to laugh. Mind you, I like offensive comedies that make dark jokes but this is justweird, gross and unpleasant. Dont waste your time on this unless you like so bad its good movies."
1523,3.0,"Dark and at least mildly entertaining. Predictable moments and surprises are about fifty fifty but all in all its a fun movie. The frozen dog scene and the end credits screaming children with shady implication are priceless.

People complaining in the reviews are HILARIOUS
  ""Amazon needs to ban this movie!""  Calm down granola munchers and soccer moms. If this movie or any other FICTIONAL depiction of a dead animal offends you that bad, have a kale salad and meditate in your safe space. It's better for your chakras than freaking out on the Internet."
1524,5.0,"I want to clear up some of the misunderstandings that I think result in some of the poor reviews here. This is a superb movie of psychological depths and gothic horror.  It is NOT a satire of Hollywood and its symbolic ""incestuousness"".  The setting in this case is Hollywood, but the basic story could have been set in any place or time in which family empires are at stake, where the culture is glittering and awsome, yet also shallow and venial, where children are made to bear responsibility for the family fortune, where sex is currency and nubes and pros alike vie with each other for the lion's share of power, money and fame. The true town portrayed here is interior to the characters not exterior.  This is a movie about unhappy families and individuals stressed to the breaking point. There is a saying that all happy families are happy in the same way, but all unhappy families are different. I always thought that was crap, and we can see that here. The themes of incest, fire, a certain movie and one special poem run through these families like a poisoned river.  The media within media (the movie within this movie and the poem) is used a lot like in Cloud Atlas, where works of art matter to the characters and reveal a practically spiritual-level understanding of characters and plot.  The biggest theme is trespass: the children of the film: the teen brother and sister, the ghost children and the adult daughter who refuses to leave her mother's shadow are/were forced to take the sins, talents, ambitions and desires of others (most notably parents) upon themselves, with predictably perverse and horrible consequences.  Maps to the Stars is explosive and catastrophic, like an Elizabethan play it offends and excites in equal measure.  The movie simply isn't meant to be taken as realism, it is more like magical realism (look it up) and in my humble opinion it's a freaking masterpeice. One can tell from most of the poor reviews that the viewers were expecting a linear story, simply told, high in realism with only explainable and rational events, and so the last fire scene really pissed them off.  None of the movie is meant to be completely literal (especially that scene, which I think is brilliant): it tells a story and the story is powerful and you might recognize yourself or society in it, but it is a story of the inside, not outside. For example you could think of reasons why the character on fire might be psychologically ""on fire"" and at that specific time... I hope that makes sense and this was helpful."
1525,1.0,"John Waters, who called the movie ""hilarious,"" clearly has a different sense of humor than I.  Humor, like beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I cannot imagine how anyone would find this movie funny.  And I don't mean this in the context of, ""I didn't find these attempts at humor funny.""  I mean, I couldn't figure out what parts were *supposed* to be funny.

This movie reminded me of the 1980's, when we were more fascinated with the problems of the wealthy and successful.  We had Dallas, Dynasty, Falcon Crest, etc... all giving us a peek into the ""money can't buy you happiness"" world of the rich and powerful.  And I just don't think this is the right time for a movie about self-centered rich people who have forgotten what real problems are.  Your child star of a son isn't finding his career satisfying?  Boo-freaking-hoo.  You can't find the right maid for you?  Pardon me while I wipe the tears from my eyes.  You didn't get the role you wanted?  Waaaaah!  Can we agree to a moratorium on movies about the movie business?  It's been done to death.

So, while this might have worked in the ""me"" decade, it's impossible to generate any amount of sympathy for these people.  The mentally-ill daughter character and accompanying plot had the occasional moment of bringing the movie up to ""mildly interesting,"" but it's way too little to save this tragic waste of talent.  Making movies like this should be grounds for criminal prosecution.  AVOID.  IN THE NAME OF EVERYTHING THAT IS GOOD AND PURE IN THE WORLD.... AVOID!"
1526,3.0,"How do you follow up a surprise hit comedy? Why, by doing the exact same thing almost scene for scene. We call this the Hangover 2 effect. Dont get me wrong, 22 Jump Street isn't a bad movie, but at the end of the day no matter how much it wants to make fun of itself, break the 4th wall, and tries to play off its laziness as just part of the joke, the fact of the matter is that this is a very lazy movie. Almost insultingly so. And no I don't think pointing this out in the film over and over and over again makes that okay. Its not that this isn't a funny movie, though clearly not as funny as the first, its that its the same movie. If youve seen 21 Jump Street then its sequel is little more than a redundant retread of old jokes, old ideas, and old plot points.

Johna Hill and Channing Tatum are once again sent under cover into school to find the supplier, infiltrate the dealers, yada yada yada, only this time they are in college. Tatum immediately strikes up a friendship with the cool kids (a frat boy, see this IS different!) while Johna Hill resents being left out and starts hanging out with the awkward outcasts, this time a bunch of art students instead of card playing NERDS!!!! Hilarity ensues, though with a bit less hilarity then the last movie. Its not that the plot is similar, its that its exactly the same. They even have the OMG we took the drug were trying to find by mistake and now were freaking out scene.  It would have been one thing had the movie made fun of itself while at the same time trailing its own path and coming into its own, but its perpetually stuck in the shadow of its much funnier predecessor.

What really saves this film is the chemistry of Johna Hill and Channing Tatum, who once again are absolutely hilarious. They work really well together and play off each others differences very well. Again, if youve seen 21 Jump Street you already know this, but this is one similarity between the two that Im glad of. Its like Seth Rogan and James Franco: whenever they get together, it just works. Combine that with a gut busting performance from Ice Cube who, thankfully, is given a greatly expanded role, and you have all the right ingredients for a very funny movie. A lot of the jokes, likewise, are actually really funny when they bother to be original. Theres one in particular involving Ice Cube, his daughter, and Johna Hill which had me rolling on the floor. So its not like this isn't a funny movie. It is. At times. This could have been a funny movie all the way through and it annoys me that they took the easy way out. When the end credits are the second funniest part of the movie, you know something went wrong.

At the end of the day 22 Jump Street isn't worth seeing in theaters even if you were a fan of the first one like me. Its definitely something you should wait to come out on video first. Good comedies have been in short supply this year unfortunately, but hey The Lego Movie comes out soon so if you want to die laughing at an extremely well made comedy just wait a few days and pick it up. As for 22 Jump Street, youll be better off waiting."
1527,3.0,"This is a tuf one..... i really wanted to give the movie 2 stars, but it was so freaking weird and confusing, i couldn't stop watching.
 the film begins with some town-folk probing the ground with sharp poles. beneath, lives a man in a hollowed-out ""room"". he escapes and as he runs thru the woods, he awakens his cohorts who live in, what i can only describe, as shallow graves with trap doors over their faces. that is the first WTF moment. be prepared for an hour and 53 min. of WTF as these con men murder and manipulate their way into the lives of an affluent family.
  the film is wrought with dark humor and had me laughing in a nervous sort of way. one example; the murder victims' heads are put in a bucket of cement and then tossed off a dock. in time, they resemble a collection of aquatic plants as their numbers increase.....sick, but morbidly funny.
 for me, what should be a horrific act, was transformed into humor due to the fact that the murders were not done in malice, but more with an ""all in a days work"" attitude.
 SPOILER: i get pretty dang torqed when i spend almost 2hrs. waiting for some kind of rhyme or reason for, in this case, total insanity and am left with nothing but the experience. i hope that was Bijvets' intent because i need at least some reason for this film."
1528,5.0,"What can you say: great acting, a great plot, space, and, oh yeah, a freaking monster that's STILL the scariest ever!!"
1529,4.0,"First let me state that I've been following this doc since it's inception.  I was actually interviewed for it way back in 2009 and it's exciting to see it's finally finished!  With that said I am actually rather disappointed and here's why.

1.  They've been releasing tidbits here and there online for a long time now.  A lot of us have seen some of the amazing interviews they got and it's an utter shame to see a large portion of them weren't used.

2.  This is far from a ""Definitive History"".  I wish they would have called this ""The Early Years"" because honestly that's what it covers.  They completely glaze over everything after the first film.  There was a golden opportunity to talk about the fourth film that almost made it into production.  It would have been nice to see more light shed on that project and why it wasn't made.  They don't talk about TMNT in other countries*such as the anime*, the Red Sky seasons of the old series, Next Mutation, the Image books, the 2003 series, TMNT, Laird's fourth volume of the comics, or anything that occurred after the buy out.  It would have also been nice to see them address the Warner Brothers cartoon series that was almost made as well as the CGI one that actually had a trailer.

Another missed opportunity was talking about the fifth film that Peter Laird was working on.  First it was a sequel to TMNT and then it became what was to be the first live action PG-13 Turtles film.  I would have liked more light shed on that.  Possibly the biggest let down though was they interviewed Lloyd Goldfine, the creator of the Turtles Forever film, but he is barely in the film at all.  Again this is because they pass over the 2003 series and again this is disappointing as Turtles Forever is one of the coolest TMNT things ever made.  Honestly all of this is made more confusing by the little timelines they cut to of each turtle that show all these things.

3.  Almost all of the footage from the movies to commercials are shown to us in tiny TV screens.  I'm not clear on why they did this.  At first I thought it was a rights issue given that all the music, including the iconic theme song, was redone by some band.  That didn't make sense though.  They full screen show us parts from the old cartoon during some segments.  Also Viacom owns everything now, why wouldn't they be able to show clips from the movie?  It's frustrating because they show things like cut footage and behind the scenes from the first film most people have never seen.  My only other guess is the quality wasn't that great so they shrunk it down to address that issue.

4.  Why isn't this longer?  At 98 minutes I'm baffled as to why they couldn't have fit in everything I'm talking about.  The Never Sleep Again doc made about the Nightmare franchise is over 4 hours long and features 2 hours of interviews that were cut from the final film.  Time is literally wasted at parts with awkward cut aways or holding on images for too long.  Why am I comparing TMNT to NOES?  Well TMNT is a much larger franchise with global recognition so why is it a niche horror franchise gets a better documentary then something as massive as Turtles?

5.  That brings me to my next point, where are the special features?  A lot of my complaints could have been addressed by the inclusion of special features.

6.  Why isn't this in HD?  Seriously where is the bluray?  Plus with a BR they could have had the space to include a lot of the things we wanted to see.

I honestly blame Paramount for all of these issues though and not the filmmakers.  They were the ones that most likely forced them to cut it shorter and didn't care to include bonus materials.  Their bare bones, and absolutely atrociously butchered, Turtles Forever DVD tells me they really don't give a crap.  For such a huge franchise a lot of the TMNT history is hard to find, even for hardcore fans, and more information/behind the scenes on the cartoons and movies would have been amazing.  Up until this the best chance you had of any behind the scenes on the first TMNT movie was a German DVD release that had commentary from the director and cut scenes.  No one has yet to put any of these materials on a US release and being that there's been so many it's rather frustrating.  Even more so to see that this stuff exists out there somewhere collecting dust in a vault.

Overall this movie pisses me off so much because these guys traveled the freaking country to get all these interviews.  I know they had hours and hours of great material.  They filmed a lot of stuff even hardcore fans like me haven't seen before.  I'm mad for them because I know how much hard work they put into this project.  Maybe one day we will get to see more of it but for now this is the best we can get.

So in conclusion a great TMNT Doc for those who want to educate themselves on the franchise but for hardcore fans there isn't a whole lot here you haven't seen before.  Still I love what it represents and had I not been ""in the know ""following this project for 6 years I might have less complaints.  Still a must have for any fan even if it's just to support the franchise."
1530,4.0,"""Palo Alto"" (2013 release; 98 min.) brings the story of a group of high school kids. As to movie opens, we see best buddies Fred (played by Nat Wolff) and Teddy (played by Jack Kilmer, yes son of Val--who also appears in the movie) sitting in the car in an empty parking lot. Fred eventually rams the car into a wall from short distance, freaking Teddy out. We also get to know April (played by Emma Roberts, yes Julia is her aunt), who is on the girls soccer team, coached by Mr. B. (played by James Franco). Soon a theme emerges: what most high school kids care about is to party, get wasted and smoke pot, and that's about it. After one of those parties, Teddy, driving under the influence, hits another car. He barely avoids juve and must do 150 hrs. of community service in the local library. At this point we're a good 20 min. into the movie and to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the big screen directing debut of Gia Coppola, yes THAT Coppola. Francis Ford is her grandfather and Sofia is her aunt. Gia was a mere 25 years old when this movie was shot. You can't help but wonder at the parallel between this and ""The Virgin Suicides"", Sofia's debut (when she was herself only 26 or so). Second, the movie is based on James Franco's book ""Palo Alto Stories"" of a few years ago. I have not read that collection of short stories, so I can't comment how close the movie has stuck (or not) to the original stories. Third, Jack Kilmer absolutely steals the movie with his performance of the vulnerable Teddy. We surely have not seen the last of him. And Emma Roberts of course confirms all the good things that we have seen of her before, although hopefully she won't be playing a 16 yr. old high school kid much longer (she's now 23). ""Palo Alto"" contains so many ""big"" and ""promising"" names, and while it certainly is an intriguing debut, the movie fails to truly set itself apart from other ""coming-of-age"" movies. For me it feels like the sums of the parts don't make up the whole.

I saw ""Palo Alto"" in early May at the Lincoln Center Film Society in New York, and the matinee screening where I saw this at was strongly attended, somewhat to my surprise. Bottom line: ""Palo Alto"" is worth checking out, shortcomings and all, be it in the theaters or on DVD/Blu-ray."
1531,5.0,"Another freaking awesome transformer movie..I miss the old characters but I am glad to see new ones that I like..Optimus Prime has always stood for awesomeness..The movie has great visual effects, beautiful Americana like towns and of course all the beautiful people.
Full of actions, comedy, romance, evil, etc etc just one heck of a movie!

I can't recall any cuss words so it will be okay to watch with family. I hope they have more Transformers movies..Optimus prime has always been a symbol of hope, honor and strength..that's never a bad thing."
1532,3.0,"Computer graphics bring an ancient Greek myth to life in this mostly well-done horror flick about a mermaid monster. Two American girls go on an exotic vacation and meet up with an old college boyfriend and his new fiance. During a day trip on the ex-boyfriend's yacht, the group spots a mysterious island with an abandoned prison (sort of like a Mediterranean version of Alcatraz.) They join forces with an old friend of the fiance's and decide to go adventure on the island even though an old man warns them sternly to ""stay away"" from the place. (Who listens to old men in cafes anyway?) The suspense builds quickly after they run into someone unexpected on the island.
Parts of this movie were absolutely excellent. There aren't many places creepier than an abandoned prison at night when your flashlight is burning out. Sometimes the acting could've been a little more convincing. The tension was quite high in some places, but I was freaking out more than the actors seemed to be at times. If you are a big fan of horror movies, put this one on your list. If you want absolute realism, pick something else."
1533,3.0,"The film opens rather smartly with a good sound track. TV chatter about meteors is playing in the background of a party where we meet John (Justin Ray) the main character of little personality and his drinking buddies, ex-gf (Stefanie Estes) and her obnoxious new boy friend who we all want to see dead.

The meteors is serious stuff as we find out the President walks out of a news conference rather than read ""My Pet Goat."" At some point in time we go from shelter in place to get out of town. Much of the film is consumed with our group running around, getting picked off one by one. Of course their odds of getting out of the city would greatly increase if they would just leave the parking garage, which occupied too much of the film. Realistic emergency recorded looping radio broadcasts.

The zombies had deformed faces, zombie teeth, and vampire eyes. They were of the fast running variety, except for that token foot dragger, most likely from a director's fetish. The film needed more zombie action and less of John and his guys running around.

Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. No f-bombs that I recalled. They went out of their way to use something that sound like ""freaking."" I thought it was worth my Redbox rental, but I wouldn't go much more."
1534,4.0,"I don't know, there are zombie movies I enjoy and ones I don't and this one I really enjoyed. The director kept a quick pace tempo all the way through, but what I really liked was his use of the long sequence shots where instead of all that stop action peek-a-boo filming he shows a more complete visual that makes the scene more interesting and exciting. He's also great with the tension build  up, there are some really gripping scenes and moments. The characters are likable for a change, this is a nice refreshing twist. The acting's pretty good, not oscar worthy or anything but certainly better than average for this sort of movie. Also the director makes good use of the CGI he does use and gives a fairly epic feeling movie on a small budget. I do wish they had more zombies but the ones they have are pretty freaking scary. These are mean zombies. Not nice zombies. Very mean.

As zombies movies go with 28 weeks Later being a 5 star I'd give this 4 stars, just for overall fun watching this thing unfold. Its a fun movie to watch."
1535,4.0,"Six years ago, the original Mostly Ghostly film was released and it was pretty good. Flash forward six years later and the Mostly Ghostly crew is back with the same characters, but almost an entirely different cast (sans Madison Pettis, who reprised her role as Tara) Unlike the original, the sequel takes on a lighter tone and is less of a spook and more of a laugh if you know what I mean. I don't recall anything scaring me or making me jump, all I remember from watching this is laughing a lot.

Casting is questionable on some levels. Recasting the part of Nicky is what bothered me the most. In the original, Nicky was portrayed by Luke Benward (a white Caucasian male) and in the sequel, he's portrayed by Roshon Fegan (an African-American male). Despite that I enjoyed Roshon's portrayal of Nicky a lot more than Luke's and not to sound racist or anything but I would've thought the filmmakers would make sure that whoever they recast as Nicky would also be a white Caucasian male like Luke Benward. Another thing about the casting is that I found is that almost every single actor in this film is or has starred in a Disney Channel show. Roshon and Bella Thorne were on Shake It Up, Ryan Ochoa was on Pair of Kings, Eric Allan Kramer was on Good Luck Charlie and Calum Worthy is on Austin & Ally. This is making me wonder if R.L. Stine is partnering with Disney to make adaptations of his books because we also can't forget that The Haunting Hour: Don't Think About It also had some Disney actors in it as well (i.e. Emily Osment and Cody Linely from Hannah Montana). Another thing that I had to say is that whoever they cast as Max's mom is freaking annoying. She did not do justice to that part. Bring back Kim Rhodes! Lol!

Aside from its casting and its overuse of slapstick comedy, Mostly Ghostly: Have You Met My Ghoul Friend is a pretty good movie and is great for kids."
1536,5.0,"Arrived earlier than expected, and in great shape....thank you.  sooooooo freaking good!!!  Someone really knew how to write and produce this show."
1537,5.0,"Behold the Yellow Brick road to Hell.

Stunningly beautiful. Shout/Scream Factory re-created this imaginative masterpiece in a re-fixed clarity that defies the mind. The image is vibrant, crisp and elegant laced beauty. Shout/Scream Factory did an extraordinary job with this amazing Blu-ray. I absolutely love what they did. A beautiful work of perfection and gave this movie what it deserved at long last. One of the great imaginative experiences in film.

Shout Factory brought out a perfection on this quality Blu-Ray. A perfect added beauty to anyone's movie collection. The enhanced new form and amazing restoration is worthy of awards. Shout/Scream Factory and all those involved in bringing Clive Barker's vision to a new light deserves; around of applause.

Nightbreed will always remain dear to my movie loving soul and Shout Factory made it all the tighter in my movie loving soul. Clive Barkers original vision and the restored clarity gives this generation a whole new vision and a whole new film to explore and to experience over and over again.

Both versions of this special edition Blu-ray are worthy to own. The 2-Disc Special Edition Directors Cut and the 3-Disc Limited Edition are both highly praised by A Bucket of Corn and if there was a national award show for best Blu-Ray release it would go to Scream Factory's Nightbreed.

I can't speak enough upon the restoration and the restored footage. I was in heaven experiencing this whole new film. I first saw Nightbreed at the movies on a Saturday night in 1990. I remember it vividly. I was eleven years old. I was one of only about a dozen people in the darkened audience. I remember it so vivid because my mother had purchased my ticket for me and allowed me to go to the movies by myself. It was the first alone experience in a theater I ever had and it was the defining moment in building my love of imaginative cinema.

This was like that experience all over again. Nightbreed Directors cut is something so new and so fresh that I fell in love with it. Midian is alive. Scream Factory created movie watching bliss. I thought it was solid. I loved the restoration and the whole new feel.

I willingly accept an invitation to Midian. Nightbreed is a different style of film and is one of those over the rainbow oddness of horror. It's not for everyone. It builds upon the imagination. The never never land of nightmares. The monsters of the darkness and the boogie man of folk tales and ultimate nightmares.

NightBreed was written by one of my favorite writers of all time. A man who has a vivid imagination for the darkness and sexual reality of evil or the nightmarish world he puts on page. Darkness bleeds off the pages into the viewers mind and his movies are no different. I absolutely loved Hellraiser and Lord of a Illusions, Candyman, and Dread. He just has a way with creating interesting scenarios and vivid characters filled with backstory and beautiful wide imagination. Clive Barker is one of the greatest creators of different worlds, of different scenarios, of different darker realities. He is your fantasy nightmare, or creator of darkness that shines in so many different ways.

Sadly this movie never got the push and the reality that it deserved when it first came out in 1990. It is based on his short story Cabal. I think what the studio actually did to Barkers vision when it originally came out, was screw him over. Barker did protest that the company tried to create your basic horror film and crafted it as a slasher flick, but in reality Nightbreed was so much deeper. So much darker. It detailed characters and a vision into a fantasy reality that gets to the soul and the true nature of Nightbreed. Its a brilliance that only Barker could create. He tried to transcend that creation onto film but the studios basically destroyed his ultimate reality when it first came out.

Now amazingly it was originally intended to be a trilogy but because of its box office failure, which basically is due to what the studio did to the film; it never went forward. Sadly we never got to experience the rest of the stories. The rest of the characters never got to move on. Barker said that we all envy the power or the reality of being able to live forever. He wanted to create a mythology around these characters and create their own understanding in their own little world. I think that is what the movie does. We all can somewhat relate to and or become a part of the darkened imagination. I for one love monsters. I love the reality behind the monsters. I've always had an affection for vampires. I've always thought it would be interesting to live as a vampire, as weird as that sounds I think we all have that imaginative imagination to become some type of monster or some superpower that makes it stand out from so called normal (there is no normal in reality).

Nightbreed is a story that needed to be told in so many different chapters of film. It could be explored throughout a comprehensive understanding of each character or the reality of where all these characters came from or to further explore the adventures of these odd and interesting monsters. I think further sequels could've done this movie justice in exploring everything it had detailed. Barker had a vision and yet the studio would not let him finish or create his vision. They chopped his film. Originally it was supposed to be 2 1/2 hours but sadly when it was released in 1990 it ran 102 minutes, basically chopping out half of the film.

Starring the wonderful actor who I feel has never really gotten the stardom he deserves is the wonderful Craig Sheffer who plays your main star Boone in Nightbreed. Also starring the beautiful and stunning Anne Bobby as Boones girlfriend Lori Winston. Both shine in there parts and the chemistry between the two bring the film into all it's wonderful twisted glory with an old school style of love and a fleeting sunset kiss. The Director's cut was able to build these two characters in more of a personal reality which is a huge plus as more story or love is added to the film giving it a more personal touch.

Something else that stands out is the soundtrack. The original motion picture soundtrack by Danny Elfman is brilliant. I think it all creates something composed for a different type of film. It leaves and works so perfect in the end result of the film. I feel it brings to life a lot of the unexplored darkness to the atmosphere and scenarios of the film.  Elfman along with Shirley Walker crafted a memorable soundtrack that stretches the viewers mind and gives everything into one soundtrack. It combined so much darkness and yet it created that ancient old African tribal type setting with the music. The drums and the voices composed inside it was just an orchestrated odd masterpiece of music.

Through horrible bad marketing and lack of promotion and the ultimate horrible editing and chopping of the movie, it failed miserably and pretty much faded away from the public into obscurity. Except for cult status. Except for the dear fan and the brilliant underground of movie lovers that know what the original product was supposed to be and even with its odd somewhat different film that it was in 1990; I still loved it. I still saw Barker in it. I still saw his darkened vision and his unexplored spiritual recesses of the flesh and of the darkness that we all can become afraid of and yet want to know.

I think Nightbreeds ultimate brilliance is the reality and basis of the films content. The so-called normal people. The normal world or the naturals as they are in the film are more evil and worse than the creatures in Midian. There's a psychological concept there. There's a psychology reality where anything that is an unnatural or anything that we don't understand we destroy. They are freaks. There monsters. They need to be stuck in the netherworld or ultimately destroyed by the so-called normal people which are the true monsters and not the Midianites.

Another thing that makes Nightbreed so brilliant is, specifically in this directors cut, is the complete imagery of the makeup and sets and cinematography. The fantastic make-up and special-effects which are stunningly brilliant lets the viewer explore these monsters as if they are real. The creatures and monsters are a make-believe that becomes an impressive masterpiece of makeup and of unexplored creatures of a dark nature. The fantasy monsters have a unique personality to each one that shine through their ultimate creation.

Now just for fun lets look at all the actor connections in the Clive Barker world that is in Nightbreed. Something on an interesting note is the actors playing some of the parts became Clive Barker regulars. Such as Simon Bamford who plays the character of Ohnaka in Nightbreed. He played The Butterball Cenebite in Clive Barker's Hellraiser and Hellraiser 2 and also many of the other sequel's. He also played in Clive Barker's 2009's Book of Blood. Oliver Parker plays the character Peloquin in Nightbreed. He was in Clive Barker's Hellraiser and Hellraiser 2 in small parts such as a moving man and a work man. Catherine Chevalier who plays the character of Rachel in Nightbreed was Tiffany's mother in Hellraiser 2. Nicholas Vince who plays the character of Kinski also plays the cenobite known as Chattering in Hellraiser 1 and 2. McNally Sagal who plays a simple part of the motel receptionist plays in Clive Barker's Lord of Illusions as Detective Edison. Bradley Lavelle who plays the character of Cormack in Nightbreed plays the character of Officer Kucich in Hellraiser 2. Kenneth Nelson who plays a simple part as an emergency doctor in Nightbreed played the character of Bill in Hellraiser. Now the big actor that is a stable in Barker films is Doug Bradley. He plays the character of Dirk Lylesberg in Nightbreed. All horror fans know him as Pinhead in the Hellraiser series which is 8 films. He also played in Barker's two short films in Salome (1973) and The Forbidden (1978). He also was in the Barker movie Book of Blood.

Also I have to mention  the wonderful cameo of a movie icon. The one and only drive-in b-movie master actor John Agar himself becomes a victim inside the nightmare that is Nightbreed. Agar needs no real introduction of his long and lasting career. From such classic drive-in features as Tarantula, The Mole People, The Brain from Plant Arous, Revenge of the Creature, Attack of the Puppet People, and so many others. It was a priceless cameo and a worthy experience to see this old school master of the acting talent of the olden days. Agar was a b-movie acting god and created so many interesting moments inside my movie loving mind and he being a victim of Decker in Nightbreed just is all the more iconic.

Now don't get me wrong I am not saying this movie is with out it's flaws for it clearly is a horror film and has the mistakes and flaws that many movies have. If I was to rate Nightbreed on it's imagination and makeup and strange odd and original style of story then it's a flawless masterpiece but I don't rate films like that. I rate films for the quality and the overall acting, direction, script and everything else that goes into making a film. Clearly this film is not for everyone. It has it's elements of a late night drive-in cult status film. It's flaws are simple yet brilliant all the same. From it's weird football shoulder pad wearing Berserkers to the clearly visible painted aerial shots of the cemetery. I over look these things because I consider this The Wizard of Oz of horror films. Instead of the yellow brick road to the Emerald city, its the yellow brick road bathed in blood to Midian. This has a style of story book imagination and an Alice in Wonderland trip down the hole into a whole other world and concept of reality. This makes me think and sends me back into a world where film was painted in techno color, but this time, the paint is thick and the story is thicker.

Now thankfully through Mark Miller who is the co-head of Barkers production company Seraphim Films went about looking and tracking down the missing footage that was cut from the film. Miller thankfully discovered some of the footage in the studio back in 2009. Basically after much fan support and uproar to bring out the beauty of this film; it worked. In 2013 Clive Barker announced that Shout Factory through its horror label Scream Factory would be releasing the film. Now this new version that Shout Factory announced would be a film over seen by Barker himself with an added 20 extra minutes that was not in the theater version and also contain 40 minutes of new and altered footage. Shout Factory along with Warner home video located the original film elements from the archives. Shout factory was able to bring the ultimate vision that Clive Barker had wanted and also all the hard work of Mark Miller to finally give the fan the ultimate edition which I am reviewing and obsessing over in this write up.

I have to say this is one of the most highly praised and anticipated Blu-rays of my movie loving career and when Shout Factory announced I quickly pre-ordered as soon as I could both versions and I proudly display them on my shelf right now. Shout/Scream Factory gives me hope and the exploration and the imaginative wonders of cinema through all their titles. They craft with ultimate brilliance and bring out some of the hard-to-find films in ultimate editions. This three disc limited edition is absolutely brilliant and could not have been any better. It is the tour-de-force of Blu-rays. The two disc Blu-ray is brilliant and amazing. Both versions are highly mastered. Highly created through stunning vibrant care and love. This film was restored and collected for a new generation to explore the wonder that Clive Barker's mind is.

I bought both versions and both versions are well worth it. The 3 Disc is amazing and the 2 Disc is amazing. I like the 3 Disc Artwork, booklet and special features because it gives so much more. But if you decide to but the 2 Disc it's just as brilliant.

If you buy the 3 Disc I feel this is possible one of the best productions of Special Features out there and the only other thing that comes close is Shout Factory's 15 Disc release of Halloween Blu-ray which I love just the same. Scream/Shout Factory is a company of perfect gifts to the fan. They know what the fan wants and they give it with heart and soul to the fan.

Overall:

I was so freaking happy when Shout/Scream Factory announced this ultra collectors orgy of perfect amazing brilliance on their part. They are a company that I find to be one of the greatest companies releasing films for fans by fans.

Finally Clive Barker's, rich imagination gets it's just do. Uncut for the first time so that all fans can get a huge boner (that is if you have a weiner) on it's amazing reality. Some of the coolest characters ever.

I was so happy to get this in the mail. For if you are reading this and have not decided to buy yet, what are you waiting for.

These are out to purchase on Oct. 28th. You can pre-order now. Their are two versions, the basic 2 Disc or the Special Edition 3 Disc which only 10 Thousand Copies have been produced which comes with special artwork and a booklet.

Also if you buy from the company and if your one of the first 3,000 you get special 18/24 posters which are just amazing and will grace my movie loving wall as soon as I frame them.

1538,5.0,"Are you freaking kidding me? I can remember as a young teenager seeing this movie on VHS at the local video store and wanting to see it but I was too young. It was just one of those movies all the kids in school got to watch but my mother wouldn't budge on it, and literally I forgot about it. This movie has that Clive Barker look, but yeesh.... not what I thought it would be.... it was better! Horror fantasy as I have never seen it before. Yes, classic enough to have Doug Bradley, the infamous Pinhead in HellRaiser, and my word..... Craig Sheffer who starred later in HellRaiser: Inferno. I'm relinquishing no spoilers whatsoever about this movie. If you haven't seen it..... you're missing out big time. Yeah, I LOVE the first two HellRaiser movies in that series from Clive Barker, but this hidden and yet what seemed to be a forgotten gem is now on blu ray... and speaking of which; yes HellRaiser broke the boundaries of the foundation of what horror could be.... but NightBreed... I have to stop before I give out some spoilers. ALL HAIL CLIVE BARKER.... WORSHIP HIM BOILS AND GHOULS! Lol....."
1539,5.0,"The commercial looked great so we rented and wow..totally a great surprisingly awesome movie..and one you can watch with your kids,over 13..but safely! The action was fanfreakingtastic..Paul Walker was at his awesome best..and will always be missed! The new guy in this..omG..what a freak..his agility was awesome...it was a sensational movie!"
1540,1.0,"Luke Evans is wasted in this movie. He is obviously a talented actor, that showed despite his starring in this horrible movie. That his acting ability shone through bad dialogue, boring scenes and impossible plot says alot for him. It is a real shame he didn't land in a better role. I will look for his next film.

Dracula Untold should have been good. It has everything, vampires, swords, fight scenes, great sets and costumes, but it was terrible. My sister fell asleep and I played on my phone the whole time. The dialogue is bad, out of character and doesn't fit either the setting, the subject or the characters. I got the distinct impression that this whole script was written by an adolescent boy. Every scene that was supposed to be scary, suspenseful and excite was instead utterly boring. Every fight scene was either skipped or shown in bits and pieces through reflections or shadows. I'm not sure if this was to cut down on blood and gore (if that's true, why even bother making a VAMPIRE movie at all) or to save money on special affects, but it was a huge epic fail. Again, why bother with a vampire movie at all if you're going to out right skip the blood?

The plot was just implausible to the point of being utterly ridiculous. Characters make a harrowing climb of a mountain cliff in minutes without a stain on their clothes and aren't the least out of breath, a monster in a save up this isolated, monstrous cliff has a cave full of skeletons of men he's killed because apparently travelers without family or friends just happen to stumble into that cave all the freaking time, and when our hero has 3 days to destroy his enemies, he spends entire nights brooding and worrying and basically wasting time. Bad guys show up in the throne room unannounced and everyone is shocked because I guess there are no guards or look outs or staff to announce their approach or presence? And, to top it all off, Turkey seems to be full of blond, blue eyed men and women.

Like I said, my sister fell asleep and I ended up reading terrible reviews about this movie online, something I definitely should have done BEFORE I paid money for this.

Then, we watched the Maze Runner, en excellent, exciting, well done film. After I wanted that movie, I went online and bought not only the movie but the entire trilogy. Don't believe all the 5 star reviews, Dracula Untold is terrible."
1541,4.0,"I thought the last half hour was kind of silly, and didn't make much sense considering the rest of the movie, and the last five minutes was just setting up a new franchise...probably a trilogy - because I guess we don't have enough of those.  My money says the second one is going to be the fight with the first vampire, who made Dracula, and the third will be fighting the demon that made the First.  It was alright, but I think it could have been better.  Plus, can't we just have a stand-alone movie?  Do we always need to start an epic freaking journey?  Still though, worth a watch."
1542,4.0,"<div id=""video-block-R2TKJAAQDTBJCA"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1fQ4PI-icS.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91oPQ8W74oS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;This was a great show.  Two season I really did not like that much.  Seemed to loose focus.  Maybe it was for the fact it had been off for such a long time in-between.  But, I got this set today.  Looks great.  Has an 80s look.  The discs seem good.  Three or four have makes.  But not deep scratches.  The way they have the DVDs is great.  Just put in the cases and over another disc.  Not laying on top.  But, it is good.

All that being said, I almost gave this set a 3.  Why you ask?  I picked up my case, to take a picture to put on my Facebook and it was freaking cracked.  A small piece of the plastic is on my desk.  I did not drop it or push hard on it.  The only thing I can think is that it is made amazing cheap.  I will be exchanging mine.  So, if you get this, be careful.

Update:
I did not realize this yesterday.  But, the front cover of the set, it has a DVD in it.  LOL  It is the Psych after show.  It had some marks on it.  It is just slid into a sleeve.  I hate when companies do that.  I will put a video on here tomorrow.  Maybe I should do it now.

I just did the video.  I am sorry if I ramble.  I had a brain injury in 03 and really have not talked to anyone other than my family.  haha  For all I know I should like a turtle.  Do turtles make sounds?  You know, I've never heard a turtle talk.  Now I am intrigued."
1543,1.0,"I don't like the new dub. I don't  care how good looking it is in HD, I want the old voices back.  It sounds like awful fandub, and I can't connect with it. Season 3 and 4 was uncut original, so why can't 1 and 2. VIZ MEDIA ruined the series, with the voices. Thanks a freaking lot.  I WANT THE OLD VOICES BACK."
1544,2.0,"Totally overrated movie.  While the tank fight scenes were fantastic, I absolutely hated the characters.  Totally over the top and unrealistic.  Brad Pitt as a tank commander?  Uh, no.  I didn't buy it.  The other characters were just so unbelievable, that I could never really get into the movie. And, of course, they mysteriously mirror exaggerated versions of Saving Private Ryan characters. Coincidence?  Nope.  And the ending?  LOL.  What a joke.  It was ridiculous.  I was literally laughing at the movie at that point.  What a shame too, because there really are some terrific tank battles in this movie.

***  SPOILERs ***
So, the tank breaks down right in the open, with zero cover, and they gun down hundreds of German soldiers.  Holding off waves and waves of enemies who have no ability to fight a disabled tank.  Yeah, right.  Give me a freaking break.  Even green troops in the Hitler Youth units would have trashed that tank in minutes.  You would think the producers would at least have the tank break down in a defensible position to at maybe give the final battle a tiny bit of realism.  But, no, the movie has to go out over the top with Transformers level action.  Oh, and of course, each member of the tank crew dies one at a time so we can all see their slow poetic deaths.  Just silly."
1545,5.0,This is a freaking awesome action movie!  You will not be disappointed.
1546,5.0,"Okay, Denzel is just so freaking awesome in this movie!!! I agree with the majority here..Don't mess with that home depot dude!! I hesitated to see this movie based on a bit of the preview but I finally decided to just go ahead and buy it from Amazon Instant Video and boy was I glad... This guy is his on Mission Impossible.. Definitely worth seeing and buying....It's right up there with his movie Safe House...Just great!"
1547,5.0,"Finally!  A sci-fi film for THINKING people.  No zombies, no vampires, no super-naturual garbage, no Transformers, no Star Trek and ... no freaking Marvel comic book junk!

Solid classical cerebral science fiction, in the same league as 2001: A Space Odyssey.  OMG, the movie actually had some real science! True, if you're an evolutionary biologist, a neurologist, or even just have a good understanding of general chemistry, there were a few things that might cause you to wince. A number of scientific concepts were stretched a bit, but that's what good sci-fi does; it pushes the boundaries of known science and theoretical science without sliding into to the realm of ridiculous fantasy.

Don't be fooled by the somewhat cliche innocent-girl-gets-revenge-against-bad-guys storyline that unfolds in the first 20 minutes; by the time the film ends, you'll have forgotten all that and be totally focused on something WAY deeper!  I won't give spoilers to those who've yet to see this work, but I did NOT see the ending coming, what unfolded was a pleasant surprise.  Ms. Johannson did an excellent job depicting the various stages of Lucy's -- uh -- ""development"" from a ditzy zoned-out blond into something other-worldy.

Yeah, there were quite a few gigantic plot holes but I was having some much fun watching I didn't really notice them all that much until the 2nd & 3rd viewing.  Also could have done with a whole lot less gratuitous violence, the obligatory car chase was kinda cool, though -- reminded me of the ""French Connection"", ""Bullet"" and ""The Blues Brothers"".

As other reviewers have pointed out, the film did make use of certain themes from a number of sci-fi classics ( primarily Dune, 2001 and  Fifth Element),  but does so in a good way; if you spot them, just smile and enjoy the moment.  As far as I can tell, the film's ""punchline""  (given in the final minutes) turned out to be something fairly unique for a sci-fi film.  If  you ever read Arthur C. Clark's classic ""Childhood's End"" (required reading for the true hardcore sci-fi geek) , then you'll enjoy the film ""Lucy""."
1548,1.0,"This movie has great potential...but never quite lives up to it.  Most of ""Lucy"" is pretty good...about 3.5 stars..but the ending just leaves you going, ""Huh?""  Its like someone had a pretty good concept in mind but couldn't figure out what to do with it.  You would have thout SOMEONE along the way would have told him, ""Its a good idea except your ending makes no freaking sense!""  Save your $5...I wish I had."
1549,5.0,"I just watched the sin city movie that came before this one on Netflix and loved it, than I watched this one the 2nd one, I watched it twice already, first time I thought this came before the other sin city, after watching again I realized this is the 2nd one...not counting the spirit since I didn't see that yet....to be honest this movie was perfect, freaking amazing, some same characters from the last movie some new..they show how the black guy looses his eye and gets a golden eye, different actors were used which made some parts confusing but overall you get it eventually...the storytelling I love the most I love movies like that when the you can hear what the character is thinking as he goes on doing what he's doing....plus I HATE black and white movies, except for ""clerks"" this is the only black and white movie I actually love and would watch over and over again, I write comic books so this really inspired me and brought me to a whole new level of writing, its almost like poetic how these guys think it was amazing a true freaking masterpiece"
1550,5.0,"I loved the first Sin City, and this one is just as good! The creators managed to keep that comic book, shot in black and white, vibe going...the dramatic poses... black and white with (small and artfully placed) splashes of brilliant color; simmering blue and green eyes, luscious red lips, whilst the backdrops and clothes and gushes of blood (and there's lots of it) are colorless...it was AWESOME!

The time is set four years after the last movie: Bruce Willis is now a ghost that manifests himself only to Jessica Alba (hot as ever!)..Mickey Rourke's character is now her protector ( and as dangerous and unstoppable as ever)..little Miho is all grown up and even deadlier than before...all the girls of Sin City are still around. I loved it...but, there where some time discontinuities. Remember the big guy with golden eye from the first movie? Well, in ""A dame to die for"" it shows HOW HE GOT THE EYE...but his freakish golden orb was already THERE in the first Sin City..??..But, all in all I absolutely loved it! Eva Green is so evil and..um..exposed that I was shocked! Her Character, and her..um..unmentionables were so freaking brazen, I was jaw dropped! I was blown away by the dark character she played in this movie so well. Anyway, I'm not going to just go on and on about this, so JUST WATCH THIS!"
1551,3.0,"Hoffman's performance was stellar, as was the rest of the cast, particularly W. DaFoe and Rachel McAdams. It's well worth a watch, even more than once, but not really a ""go-to"" movie. The reasons why are pace and storyline. A few reviewers labeled it as ""fast-paced"" but it's quite the opposite - 2 full hours of interesting yet extremely slowly-evolving drama. As for the storyline, I only mention it because 3/4 of the way through I still had no freaking clue what was going on and had to Wikipedia the plot (somewhat hard to do without getting to far and ruining the rest of the movie). It worked, though, and was able to enjoy the ending much better.

A note on Hoffman: it's a terrible shame this was his last major role. I don't know how actors who are able to morph so deeply into their characters are able to cope in a positive way with ""real life."" I don't know if the SAG offers support for their members in this regard, but to me it seems like a no-brainer that it's either desperately needed or in dire need of improvement."
1552,5.0,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description sorely lacking, I decided to compile this list of product information for the benefit of prospective buyers. I hope you find this information useful.

THE BIG BOSS (1971) - 99 minutes - Director: Wei Lo - Starring: Bruce Lee, Maria Yi - Genre: Action, Kung Fu - Plot: A young man sworn to an oath of non-violence works with his cousins in an ice factory where they mysteriously begin to disappear. R

FIST OF FURY (aka THE CHINESE CONNECTION) (1972) - 107 minutes - Director: Wei Lo - Starring: Bruce Lee, Nora Miao - Genre: Action/Kung Fu - Plot: A young man seeks vengence for the death of his teacher. R

THE WAY OF THE DRAGON (1972) - 90 minutes - Director: Bruce Lee - Starring: Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris - Genre: Action/Kung Fu - Plot: A man visits his relatives at their restaurant in Italy and has to help them defend against brutal gangsters harassing them. R

GAME OF DEATH (1978) - 100 minutes - Director: Robert Clouse - Starring: Bruce Lee, Gig Young - Genre: Action/Kung Fu - Plot: A martial arts movie star must fake his death to find the people who are trying to kill him. R

Now lets crunch some numbers. This box set costs $41.98, and contains 4 films. When we divide to find the price of each individual film, we get a price of $10.50 per film. This is a fair deal to own this kickass set of action films from the greatest action hero of all time: Bruce freaking Lee. If you found this information helpful, please give it a like. Thanks."
1553,5.0,"When we first see Stonehearst Asylum it is shrouded in fog, and there is a raven croaking at the gate. A freaking RAVEN. That was the first sign to me, that this movie was not going to be your run-of-the-mill period chiller. And you know what? It delivers on every level. Start with a masterful cast playing vibrant, lurid characters, throw in a fast-paced, surprisingly fun script with enough twists to astound even the most astute viewer, and saturate it with some excellent atmosphere and mood, all shadows, secrets, and flickering candle lights!

Let's talk about the cast first, because what a cast it is. Jim Sturgess leads as Dr. Edward Newgate, who with his wimpy mustache and thick spectacles, seems the most unlikely-looking romantic lead in Hollywood. But its also a brilliant and stunning performance filled with surprising gravitas. Kate Beckinsale shocks everyone with a vulnerable and subtly beautiful performance as a 'chronic hysteric'. But it is Sir Ben Kingsley as Dr. Silas Lamb that electrifies the entire screen and steals all of the scenes. All of them. I haven't seen a good actor have this much fun since Coppola's Dracula. Sir Ben is an acting BEAST in this movie. David Thewlis, Michael Caine, and Brendan Gleeson - all some of the greatest actors all to step in front of a camera, have memorable side roles, all hiding dark secrets and captivating the audience.

The performances are so electrifying, so subtle, so powerful and of so high a calibre, they elevate what could have easily been overblown Gothic camp or a boring chiller, into a thrilling spectacle unlike anything we've seen in a while. There are no black-or-white heroes or villains; the doctors are sometimes cruel, the lunatics are angry but pathetic. This allows for some unexpected real drama and truly interesting characters.

Then there's the plot, which is apparently an elegant and terrifying confection of madness, secrets, and twists and turns on every front. The setting could not be more ripe for horror. I mean, a Victorian lunatic asylum perpetually shrouded in fog and thunder? With RAVENS croaking at the spiked iron gates? But thankfully, STONEHEARST ASYLUM eschews the jump scare for the subtle build-up of dread, and blood and gore for mind games, dark secrets, hidden passages, and classy tension. Until that is, the Asylum and everyone in it goes mad. There's something timelessly macabre about two hundred lunatics madly dancing round a bonfire, or dancing to classical music, some swaying, some twitching, some manic, some merely pathetic.

STONEHEARST ASYLUM ain't perfect. There's some irking plot holes, and everyone's motivation is a bit muddled. There's one character who can apparently survive having a half ton of coal dropped on his head... But this is a really top-notch psychological thriller, which doubles as a moving discourse on madness and sanity, and the cruel practices of Victorian medicine. Not for those who like their films light and snappy, cool and easy. But if you like horror, suspense, Gothic, Edgar Allen Poe, or just a good old-fashioned, scary psychological thriller, I can't recommend this movie ENOUGH.
Five utterly mad, completely bonkers, absolutely insane stars.

P.S. If this review was helpful to you, please give it a like. Cheers!"
1554,1.0,"I literally am considering writing to Amazon and demanding my money back for this rental.  This could have been a good movie but it is too dreary and slow and ""already been done"".  Plus the caliber of actors in some of the supporting roles is absolutely terrible.  There were even some voice / video sync issues where someone would be talking and the actual words came just a millisecond or two before or after the movement of the lips, like this was some kind of old kung fu film.  There's no excuse for that these days.

The end was just terrible, too.  Antonio has his baby and nobody seems worried they have themselves and their baby right next to what is apparently a nuclear radiation zone... they just sort of hang out and rest now that all the cowboy style gun fighting is over?  Not even close to believable.  So many freaking holes in this movie... just so aggravating to have spent a dime on it."
1555,4.0,"I loved this movie to pieces, but It does have a certain issue that I need to point out.
Mainly the release.
>I bought this on DVD solely due in part to me not being able to justify the Blu-Ray price, I've bought pricey Blu-Ray's before but they are usually combo packs and are usually no more than 20ish dollars, the Blu-Ray version of this is freaking $35.95! and in limited print!, and for that price you get the English dub on 1 Blu-Ray Disk and the original Japanese version with 4 mins of extra footage on the other plus a standard clear case and some 24 page art booklet which barely warrants the price in my opinion, why not put both versions on the same Disk and package the DVD version as well?, oh right because the Japanese version has 4 mins of footage not in the ""International version"" which should have just been put in the English dubbed version in the first place, I mean...from what I've heard they are backstory scenes involving Ezra (Isola), Logan (Yama) and Nami that are supposedly important to the plot, scenes like this are scattered all throughout the film anyway so why cut them from the ""International ver.?""
I was also not too fond of the at some times ""Weird"" english dub, with strange dialogue and dumb name/plot changes.
I would have preferred Funimation or Sentai Filmworks to release this, because I was quite pleased with the Sentai release of appleseed, which included both the old and new dubs and was a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack for only $11.95 and sentai is usually expensive!
I hope another company aquires the right to this in the future to give it the justice it deserves."
1556,5.0,Scouts Guide To The Zombie Apocalypse was surprisingly freaking hilarious!
1557,4.0,Hands down this is easily one of my favorite anime of all time. The animation is superb the story is phenomenal and the price was good. I won't say what the show is about because there is probably 99 other reviews on here with exactly that. What I will say is that the reason I knocked one star off is because its not on blu ray. Which I would buy in a freaking heartbeat. Get on it guys!
1558,5.0,San Fran freaking tastic!!!
1559,1.0,"This was one of the slowest and most boring movies I have ever watched. Mississippi Burning is a million times better. This film is so freakingly slow, for example, Dr. King is on the bridge and stands with his people in front of the cops. Then he knees down, prays, then he turns around and walk away. I get that this happened in real life, but did they have to shoot it in real time as well? IT'S A FREAKING MOVIE! MOTION PICTURES! Those pictures need MOTION, otherwise it's like looking at a photograph.

Frankly, I don't know what the hell is happening to African-American films. I mean, the scene of King's wife confronting him about his adultery, another slow poke moment. Honestly, did they have an editor? Did they decide not to cut anything? Very disappointing.  Here's an idea, want to learn about King? Read a book. You'll learn far more than with this poor excuse of a movie. I have similar feelings about 10 Years A Slave, another disappointment."
1560,5.0,"I watched The Guest on a whim not expecting much.  I absolutely loved the music, actors and style of this film; an instant cult classic.  This is an homage to the 80's B-movie action/drama/black comedy.  Much in the way Drive was just not as serious in tone.  This movie pokes fun at itself and has a blast while doing so.  The music along with the movie is mind-blowing fantastic.  The one star reviews clearly didn't get it as this is geared more towards a person who's appreciative of camp and not looking for the next blockbuster.  In a nutshell, I freaking loved it."
1561,2.0,"I can't really say that I hated it (1 star) but I didn't really like it either.  I'm not a fan of ""found footage"" and/or ""paranormal research"" type films, and had the description been a bit more accurate I probably wouldn't have watched it.

I didn't think the acting was really bad...after all, these are not $1-million dollar actors.  The parts didn't go beyond their acting abilities.

The story line was somewhat believable: kids looking for drugs and alcohol for a party, taking the drugs, and freaking out when everything conceivable turns to crap.  Tsunami and flooding were the cause for the party.  But when the drugs turned out to be bad, there had to be a gun involved, with the scariest looking dude handling it.  The party breaks up and the kids head to town for a bigger party, only to have their way blocked by a forest fire. The main characters go down through a tunnel to come out on the other side of the fire, only to find the town deserted, and the moon eclipsed by some unknown object.  The most exciting part of the whole movie was watching the battery on the camera run down, and finally die just as the lead character was dragged off-screen by a Specter."
1562,4.0,"Loved it! Crude, rude and hilarious. I was prepared to be disappointed due to the bad reviews, but it made me laugh the whole movie. Very similar to watching a good episode of Family Guy. If you plan to take any of it seriously, you will be sad. But it's about a freaking talking Teddy Bear, ok?"
1563,5.0,"Hilarious.  I thought Ted 2 was better than the original.  Was going to give 4 stars, but since Tom freaking Brady is in it and Tom Brady is a Gawd, it gets 5 stars."
1564,4.0,"This is missing a star because of the unnecessary love story between two people who clearly would never even look at each other. Secondly, because, though I know the T-Rex can't run to save it's life (literally), there is no way miss pompous could outrun it ever and especially in heels. Next, we all know there is no way she went running around a forest in white, sheer clothes and came out alive. And finally, will someone tell the writers that the teenage-angst-boy represents no one in this world. No one stares at girls like that and no person would rather look at chicks than freaking live dinosaurs. This is definitely a movie I can sit down and watch pretty much any time. I absolutely loved the original trilogy (little iffy on the 3rd one) and this is a great addition to it. I will always love the original Jurassic Park above all others, but I do have to say that this was awesome."
1565,1.0,"DO NOT BUY THE AMAZON DOWNLOAD IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR CLOSED CAPS! I apologize for the caps, it was meant for emphasis and attention. The CC are not meant for this movie. Total freaking waste!"
1566,5.0,"my little brother and i, follwing in the footsteps of the prior three jurassic flicks, went to see jurassic world, and i will say this: it was thoroughly awesome and out of control. i love dinosaurs, i love king kong (don't get yer hopes up; the big guy aint here, just that the movie is structured a lot like the original kong), i love the first three movies, and i really, really love seeing people get, um, eaten i guess would be the right word. and boy, do they get gobbled up in jurassic world.

like jaws 3 demonstrates, there are just some animals that shouldn't be kept in theme parks; a freaking awesome genetic amalgamation of several varieties of dinosaurs and other animals sprinkled in for complete bada$$ery tops the list. she escapes. totally satisfying carnage ensues. i mean this from the bottom of my heart: it couldn't have been better.

oh, sure, the movie is loaded with questionable decisions, choices, and actions. how on earth could a theme park allow visitors free-range control of ride vehicles in dino paddocks? why on earth, after the fiasco of every movie ever made, did the designers of jurassic world not build a giant bunker to house guests in the (inevitable, inexorable) event of a dinosaur jailbreak? it's also just possible that the makers of jurassic movies have oversimplified genetics. i could go on, but why bother? these are not issues for me. would i mind a little bit better science, both for my own paleontological satisfaction and to elevate the ""plot""? no, i wouldn't, but i still got what i came for: heavy doses of dinosaur action!

we get this new dinosaur, we get velociraptors, we get all manner of awesome pteranodons, ankylosaurs show up, and many, many more. it couldn't have been cooler. the dinos interact with people, fight each other, run, fly, swim, and as mentioned earlier, dine heavily on homo sapians. there were a couple of scenes of discovery, of people interacting peaceably with or around dinosaurs that could have been extended, to build up the feeling of awe and love that many of us have for dinosaurs, but what the hey? predation is pretty darn cool, too. the velociraptors get a little advancement in their behaviors, and are all chummy with trainer owen, played wonderfully by chris pratt.

like in guardians of the galaxy, pratt shows himself an able leading man of blockbusters, and i'll go ahead and cast my early vote for him to take the reins as the next indiana jones. like harrison ford, pratt is the right combo of funny, physical, and compassionate. the latter point is on grand display in jurassic world, as pratt forges believable bonds with his raptor crew, and really sees the dinosaurs as individual beings, with their own needs and desires (i think he might say exactly this). owen groks dinosaurs, but he doesn't grok all of these people who see them as a meal ticket, people like...claire, who is played really entertainingly by bryce dallas howard. she also gets to be physical and engaging, and she carries her part ably. her character is yet another uptight, ambitious business woman, but she thaws and becomes a real character who loves children (yay!). it's alittle tiresome to see a women stuck in this particular trope once again, that of being all business or all nurture, with little in-between, without balance. ty simpkins and nick robinson are great as the brothers, who have a anne darrow-jack driscoll kind of experience in jurassic park, excuse me, world, recalling more than once the former pair's experiences on skull island. and of course, they wind up better brothers for it.

the special effects were great, some of the best cgi i've seen. i think the original really showed us the best way to use cgi, to mix it with models and puppets, to use each to their strength, but jurassic world looks beautiful. the dinosaurs have heft and texture, and i didn't really question at all that they were there. like the original lost world (1925), king kong (1933), or even the valley of gwangi, my dinosaur needs were met, exceeded, and chewed to bits. i think willis o'brien and ray harryhausen would have enjoyed them.

going forward with the series, i would love to see amblin take a page out of george romero's book: enough with controlled parks. let the dinos out, let them reclaim the world, let's move forward into...a dinosaur apocalypse and see pathetic humanity attempting to survive, developing appreciation for our small, mammalian forebears who towed the line for 30 or so million years, waiting for the dinosaurs to take a fall.

jurassic world exceeded my expectations by a lot. i knew it would be fun, but i didn't realize how satisfying it would be. let's keep this dinosaur train rollin!"
1567,4.0,"Great action movie and wonderful acting. However, the idea of ""who done it"" is way too old, and it does not make any freaking sense when a good guy turns bad and the bad guy turns good... Just like the effects of a character morphing into anybody he/she wants to in the Terminator or X-Men start to bore me. I like movies where the good is good and the bad is bad with complications of them fighting until the good wins."
1568,4.0,"Solid minor action film, more like a Bond caliber film, but more about story & characters, then blowing things up! (that being said I'm not trying to trash, the Bond movies, I freaking love em!)"
1569,1.0,"A lover of Horror/Scary movies..so few are made that provide good jolts..Having watched this recently on Netflix, I was curious because of some positive reviews I read online about it. Well it was nothing but depressing since the main character was always depressed (understandably so), I hate weak/passive/victimed characters and the kid in the movie was so freaking annoying!!!! I'd wish he was killed off early in the movie...lol..I understand about the characters being played, but some scenes especially w the kid gave me an annoying headache! Plus in the end, I did fast fwd lots...I had no clue what the damn thing was or what was meant by ending....Not a good film sorry...."
1570,5.0,Bring kleenix and a crying towel because this story is one Disneys best and most beautiful stories. It should be a huge huge hit but only those with real taste like you and me realize how fabulous this film really really is. Fabulous. Just freakingfantasticallyfabulous.
1571,5.0,"If there was a 10-star option, I would gladly click all 10 stars! I should probably wait until a few days from now when Amazon asks me if I want to review the movie to actually review the movie because I am feeling so absurdly and deliciously emotional right now I can be nothing but absurdly deliciously biased. I chanced upon this movie tonight, and after watching the trailer decided to rent the movie to de-stress from twilight zone day at work. I agree with the other reviews that Lily Collins continues to mature into an amazing actress. The chemistry between Lily and Sam is fantastic, and duly empowered by a great fantastic storyline. The storyline is not original, but the director, actors, and soundtrack differentiate the movie from others that have traveled the same road. If at 43 years, I'm at the mid-point of my life I am willing to spend the rest of my life believing that love can be true and that neither space nor time can dissuade the perseverance of true love. Maybe the movie caught me at the right moment, but the feeling that pinches in my left chest is sweetly reminiscent of a dimly lit high school dance floor, a nervous hand resting firmly on the small of my  14 year old back, the sound of the 16 year old heart beating beneath my ear as my head lay on his shoulder, Air Supply's ""All Out of Love"" enveloping us as we swayed side to side knowing that everything was possible. What happens that causes us to give in to the vagaries of life and give up on the victories of love? What causes us to deny our hearts while convincing ourselves that what we feel is so natural and powerful it must be wrong? What causes us to stop following our dreams at our own peril? I know a movie is a winner when I feel, and I do so feel after watching this movie. I could blither on, but my point is great movie, great directing, great acting, great message, just freaking great!"

1575,1.0,"One star only to bring the balance of all these ridiculous reviews who have given this movie a 4 and 5. It deserves a 3 star.
Story - A bad ass ex-bounty hunter trying to live a straight life with his wife becomes distraught after loosing her due to illness. He receives a final gift from her as a very cute dog (you shd watch him). Some gangsters see an awesome ride John Wick drives and wants to rob it. They enter his house at night, kill his dog and steal his car. So John Wick gets angry and start killing people until he has destroyed the whole mafia.

Pros - Cutest dog ever,
Cons - Horrible acting, horrible action sequence. The bad ass John Wick first of all is not bad ass at all. Secondly he lets a girl live who is his worst enemy just for no freaking reason. Talk about gender equality. ant to see the real bad ass, watch the Equalizer."
1576,5.0,"I watched John Wick on a Saturday afternoon to kill some time.
5 minutes in I was hooked.
This was the sleeper hit of the year for me.
Far fetched action that feels grounded and more believable than the action flicks of the 90s.
I loved this movie so much that when it came out, I decided I was going to buy it.
Well it took me 3 weeks to find it.
I went to at least 3 different best buy and at least 4 walmart stores.
This movie is freaking awesome!
Highly recommended."
1577,4.0,"I generally cannot watch movies involving the deaths of beloved pets. They crush me. I heard awesome reviews of this film from friends but put off watching it for fear that The Scene would ruin everything for me but I decided to give it a go after being assured The Scene was short and not focused on much...despite being the whole point of the movie.

While The Scene was really tough to swallow, the film as a whole was freaking awesome. Keanu Reeves was born to play characters like this: brooding, quiet, introspective bad asses.

I thoroughly enjoyed the action and the dialog....looking forward to the already talked about sequel"
1578,4.0,"Chemistry can make all the difference in a film, even when the story has been done before. St. Vincent wasn't a great film because the story was out of this world. In fact, it wasn't even all that original, but rather the fantastic chemistry between veteran Bill Murray, and newcomer Jaeden Lieberher made all the difference. After a bitter divorce, Maggie & Oliver have been forced to move to a new neighborhood, where they find their new neighbor is a bitter old drunk named Vincent (Murray). Vincent wants nothing to do with anyone, until happenstance throws him together with Oliver, who he reluctantly agrees to watch in exchange for a paycheck, but what does he know about taking care of a kid? Even though this movie could have been more raunchy, Bill Murray is always funny and paired together with this scrawny, innocent, overprotected kid, made for some of the best interplay I've seen in a very long time. Murray was at the top of his game, but he almost had the show stolen right out from under him by young Jaeden Lieberher. Four years later, we know this kid is a star, and after seeing this performance, it's easy to see how he landing huge roles in the movies It and The Book of Henry. Finally the cast is rounded out by Melissa McCarthy who I honestly can not stand anymore, but believe it or not, she was very reserved and laid back. I didn't know she was actually capable of doing that. St. Vincent won't win any awards for originality, some parts could be a bit slow, although there were a few surprises. As for me, I love the chemistry, I always enjoy seeing how young actors and actresses got their start, and the film stars Bill freaking Murray, need I say more?"
1579,2.0,"I'm only going to say this.. Christina Aceto as ""Dr. Leigh Rozetta"" - ask for a bathroom break or do it on freaking screen but BLOW YOUR DAMN NOSE. You were snotting so damn bad a FEW TIMES, that I couldn't even hear anyone talking. my freaking gawd. just blow your f'ing nose. They do allow breaks and it doesn't make it appear ""more authentic"" if you're snotting and constantly sucking it up just to make it appear as you've been crying. Gross. The only reaction I got out of this movie was wanting to b slap your butt and hold you down and make you blow your nose. Take 3 seconds and blow! That alone made the movie unbearable with her in the scene. It's freaking unprofessional to do that while on set. Want to make it in the big time, know when to blow your freaking nose. If it's an allergy, take a damn pill before screen call.

And I'm not going to do the research, but is that your sister in the movie Don't Blink? ...because she does the same exact thing - she does not blow her freaking nose if it were to save her freaking life. What the hell is wrong with you people that you can't take 3 seconds and blow. It does NOT add to the shot. It makes you look as an unconditioned, unprofessional actress - learn how to create a tear up/cry without having it roll out your nose so you don't have snot rolling and then sucking it up - gross, yet again - if you're unsure how to work on this, learn how to play poker and then get into a relationship. Put those two together, wait until he screws up and there you go. Tear up, no snot. You're a female - it should be easy.

*throws hands up in disgust* Yeah, I'm a smart ""a"" and I'd tell this to your face. BLOW YOUR NOSE. <3"
1580,5.0,"Awesome is all i can say. This movie is freaking epic.
The HD visuals are nice and crisp, the sound is great and the action and bits of comedy tie it together well."
1581,5.0,"I absolutely loved this movie and felt the acting was excellent.  The story was so freaking depressing though!  I mean, not what you see in the movie, except the very end.  SPOILER ALERT - do not read on if you don't want to know some major plot points.  I still get so sad to think that this amazing genius, Alan Turing, who could have spent the next 20-30 years developing who knows what other technological breakthroughs, had his life cut short at 40 because he was gay.  It just sticks in your gut and makes you wish you weren't a part of such a malicious race of human beings.  I mean, this man saved MILLIONS of lives by developing his Turing machine and sparked the advent of the modern computer.  The fact that the man responsible for stopping the Nazis (who arbitrarily decided that Jews were evil, not to mention gays, political dissidents and anyone else they wanted to lump in there) was himself the victim of a society who arbitrarily decided that his sexual orientation was a crime and treated him like an animal because of it, it's overwhelming.  And I can't get past the fact that no matter what progress we've made in terms of gay rights, or the rights of whatever group is currently being arbitrarily discriminated against at the moment (African-Americans, Hispanics, Women, Atheists, the list goes on and on), none of that will bring this man back, will undo the utter injustice of his chemical castration and the misery he must have felt in the last few years of his life.  I weep for that lost life, the lost brilliance that could have changed everything.  Who knows where we would be now if he had lived.  So, this movie is a fantastic tribute to a man who did not fit into society's neat little boxes of how people should be, and also a stark reminder of how cruel and inhumane those who try to enforce those boxes are."
1582,1.0,"This it was just a damn joke of any plausible idea of a film B rated or otherwise. Plus there was too much bush even though it was a 70s flick. The characters were very poorly developed, and the acting was equally bad if not far worse. The  director should be shot for creating such a freaking atrocity of a film"

Michael Rooker was funnier than he has been in years, that's a big plus is my book.

Maybe the sequel will kick this thing into overdrive because what we have here is easy to watch but not very memorable."

1593,5.0,"Finally, Wagners' epic vision can be realized, maybe for the first time, on an imaginary scale equal to the music.  Now, I know that RW himself wanted his opera produced a certain, specific (read as very, very Traditional) way.  Cosima enforced this during her reign as director for the rest of her very long life.  If you like that presentation, you got that other Met production thats as good as the traditional style will get.  IMO opera won't survive w/o something new and fresh, it really needs to be re-interpreted with each new generation.  This version is pretty spectacular.  Others have used projection technology, but this has ""The Machine.""  This has the added advantage of a 3-dimensional space that the projection can be shot on.  So, in Seigfried, you have a beautiful forest scene that the actors can walk across, while the computer technology rustles the leaves underfoot.  Then the Machine can change postion to a wholly vertical screen if necessary.  Then, take a look at the amazing journey to Nibelheim, the Machine is twisted as Wotan and Loge ""walk"" on suspened wires across to the depths of the netherworld.  The climax to Das Rheingold is... wow.  As the Gods ascend up the Rainbow Bridge (here a beautiful glimmering computer generated and projected rainbow), the Machine then tilts down on both sides until it is completely vertical, and a full Starfield is seen.  Wow.  This reminded me of that scene in Immortal Beloved.  Oh, the opening with the undulating wave effect and the Rhinemaidens suspended in midair, bubbles coming out of their mouths while they sing.  The technology is finally here, and vision has equalled vision.  So many great moments (and many ""dull 1/4 hours"").  One final note, a slightly negative one, and this is regarding the actual libretto.  Dare I criticize Wagner himself?  Why not... the Ring is way, way, much too repetitive in it's storytelling.  You hear the same freaking subplots told about 20 times over and over and over by seemingly every possible character.  It got on my nerves about the 15th time I heard how Wotan could not steal the ring himself so he had to have Seigfried do it for him.  I mean, I've heard this already.  Once, maybe twice... but 20?  I don't need that.  And this true of every single subplot.  7 times you hear how Seigfried had no fear and killed the dragon and through the blood can understand birds.  I don't need to hear this told 7 times.  Ok, Ive beaten this point enough... Lol.  Awesome music, awesome production, all on Blu Ray delivered to your door .....we live in great times my friends."
1594,5.0,"(1) This movie is based off of a play, and for those who are die hard fans of the original play Disney did not destroy it with this movie adaptation. Most of the time when Disney gets a hold of a play, book, story, concept they change so much of it, that their movie version barely mirrors the original story/book/play. However, the same can not be said about this movie. The movie version of Into The Woods is pretty much the same as the play (at least the version I had seen years ago). Of course, there are more special effects in this movie compared to the play. But the overall flavor of the play can be felt/ seen throughout this film. For example, in the play version (I had seen) the scene with Jack singing about his experience first climbing the beanstalk was left to the imagination. Jack sang about climbing the beanstalk, and dealing with the giant, and the giants wife, but there were no visual representations of castle, giants, or anything else. The audience had to listen to the words in Jack's song and use their imagination to picture the giant, and the castle, and so on. In this movie version it's the same thing. The audience listens to Jack, and you have to imagine most of what he is singing about. I was surprised at this, because Disney tends to put a lot of visuals in their movies.
(2) SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS STORY. Due to the fact that this was a Disney movie, most audience members believed that Disney would create characters to look like their versions (for example Cinderella). However, this is not so. There is not one character in this film that represents/ looks like any one Disney character. The play itself was loosely based on the Grim Brother's story version of (most) the characters. For example, in the Grim version of Cinderella the step mother cuts off chunks of her daughters' feet in order to get the slipper to fit. = also in the movie (not gory/don't see anything being cut off). Also, in the original Cinderella, after Cinderella gets married angry birds peck the step sisters eyes out. In this version you do not see the birds attacking the sisters, however, as the movie progresses, the sisters are suddenly blind/using walking canes. For anyone who knows the original story this makes perfect sense. However, if you do not know the original story then it will be confusing. The original fairy tales (before Disney got a hold of them) had darker messages, messages of don't trust outsiders, think before you act, the world is a dangerous place, and in this movie/ and the play the same message remains. DO NOT WATCH THIS EXPECTING A DISNEY STYLE MOVIE BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT FIND IT.
The original story of little red riddinghood had more of the message of a girl becoming a woman (hence the red cape/change of life), and the wolf symbolized the lust of men. The overall message was to stay on a virtues path and do not give into the evils of the world/man otherwise they will devour you. In this movie/ the play this message remains. However, it is not in your face obvious...you are meant to read more into the song the wolf sings. He does not just want to devour the little girl (food wise), he also wants to have relations with her. However, rest assured, there is no inappropriate relations in this film. Most people will simply hear the song and interpret it to be about the wolf seeing red as food.
(4) The movie is beautifully done, in an, almost, gothic style. The acting is excellent, and the singing is wonderful. However, do not expect a lot of special effects. Yes you have the woods, and the witch disappearing in a cloud of dust, and the giant/his wife. For example, for a lack of effects, Depth plays the wolf, but he is dressed more like a man wearing a fur coat, and whiskers...he is not a CG wolf, and does not morph into a CG wolf. How they designed the wolf's look is very much the same as it was in the play version.
(5) I'm not going to lie...I did fast forward one, or two songs. I love this movie/ and the play, however, I can only handle so many songs in a movie/play. And even though this was a well done film, I did not need to hear every freaking song there was (two hour movie). However, this does not mean that other viewers will feel the same way.
(6) The overall message/s of the play/ movie is that you need to be careful what you wish for, no one person is good but no one person is evil either, and we all do things for specific reasons, which can affect others. The woods represent the world, and how unpredictable it can be, especially with all the different people in the world looking for/ and doing anything they want in order to obtain their worldly needs/desires. Also, how nothing is black or white. For example there is a scene/ song related to red riddinghood. She began to have doubts about killing the giant's wife. Cinderella then sings a song which is about not seeing the world as black and white. ""Some times witches can be right, and giants good."" The song is really about you need to do what you feel is right for you. The overall message/s of the film are refreshing.
I especially loved the cold hard fact that despite Cinderlla belief that she had found prince charming, that he was in reality shallow, and a cheat (like in the real world). There is no happy endings in life, only continuations, uncertainty, and change, and this movie reflects those themes as well. DO NOT EXPECT DISNEY!!!!!!!! Only expect a brilliant film that has been based on a musical/play, which itself is based on the original, darker, fairy tales
(6) would I let my children watch this???????? Yes, but only the older ones. Personally I don't think that younger children would keep an interest in this film (a lot of singing in the woods). This movie is meant for a more mature audience. However, if your younger child should watch it there are some deaths (but nothing too graphic), very little to no blood (Cinderela's step sisters feet are cut but you don't see it- only hear the step mother singing about it as she holds a knife). As for the prince cheating on Cinderalla there is no nudity, no sexual suggestions...only a kissing scene with the baker's wife.
So, it is up to you if you wish to journey into the woods. I have been into the woods, and I intend to go back someday. ""Into the woods, and out of the woods""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

1597,5.0,"GREAT MOVIE - CULT FILM

It got off to an odd start but my movie partner and I really enjoyed this movie quite a lot. The old guy that leads them to the entrance of Marrow is funny as heck in a certain way - eccentric. We both agreed that the ""old"" guy (not that damn much older than me) makes this movie what it is. The guy is a total, freaking trip. Is the movie scary? Parts of it were. I will say that the ending is twisted and dramatic. Come into this with a sense of humor and an open mind. Taken this way, this is one of the best movies I have seen in years. Therefore, I heartedly recommend this movie to those who enjoy ""cult"" Indie horror flicks. Tim Jr, you need to watch this - I know you'd like it a lot."
1598,4.0,"ok, Adam this movie/ documenatary/ live found footage style film was pretty good. But I got to say, To the director, a couple of things and 1. I think your gay, maybe a closet gay with a wife but definitely gay, something about your mannerism just remind me of a gay guy. 2. you are sorta cute. and 3. I hope you are not like your character in the movie in real life, because, you was,so freaking annoying, pretty dumb and downright obnoxious, you did the exact thing the idiots do in scary movies and instead of walking away and calling it quits you kept at it. I felt like strangling you at times but with all that said. Good job good film ;)"

1602,5.0,this movie is freaking awesome. so happy I have it now.
1603,5.0,"Best movie of 2014. There, I said it. I just freaking loved this movie. The characters are fun (especially Groot). The story is fun. It's like a Star Wars for the 2010s -- the original Star Wars, when it was just FUN. Great popcorn movie. Great anything movie, really. I'm probably going to wear out my Blu-Ray. Oh, and going in, I was not a big Marvel fan. You do not have to be a Marvel fan, and you do not have to have read the GotG comics, to enjoy this movie."
1604,5.0,"Having watched Chris Pratt in Parks and Recorations...my husband immediately wanted to turn the movie off, right at the beginning. I persuaded him to give it a chance and boy were we glad we did. The movie is just freaking hilarious. Especially Rocket and Groot...
All of the cast is good, so many deadpan delivery's (""I am going to die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy""-Soldana)  to emotions like Rocket saying in frustration "" You're. making. me. kick. grass!!!""
Its a fun movie, I think it would be just fine for older children...its one of the few movies that I remember in years that made my nephew laugh out loud and more than once. (younger ones usually like animations and a lot of the humor would go over their heads)."
1605,3.0,"There is a primary femme in Guardians of the Galaxy, but she is basically another Black Widow variant. The movie almost should've been called ""Male Guards of the Galaxy"" as even the freaking TREE is characterized as a male. I wouldn't be so torqued about this were it not for the fact that the Marvel movies have been so misogynistic in general.

Michael Rooker was funnier than he has been in years, that's a big plus is my book. Chris Pratt was unfortunately miscast - he should've voiced Groot, while Vin Diesel should've played Star Lord (instead of voicing Groot). Follow what I'm saying? Maybe the sequel will kick this thing into overdrive because what we have here is easy to watch but not very memorable."
1606,5.0,"One of the best marvel movies out there. Marvel is definitely showing that they can even make their B list of Heros be freaking amazing. This movie pushed the boundaries a little bit. With the cursing and sexual content/adult humor. This move has a great story, great cast, amazing action and space battles. I highly recommend this movie."
1607,2.0,"No, I'm not a professional movie critic and I'm not an actor. So who am I to criticize this movie so harshly? I'm a 62-year-old woman who has watched thousands of movies over a lifetime and gained a modicum of discernment through the years. I can't carry a tune but I sure as hell know when someone is singing off key. This review isn't meant to denigrate anyone's talent or ability but is my honest and heartfelt opinion based on my life as an avid cinephile.

The actors:

The best performance in this movie was given by Sydney McCann, who played the youngest child, Ariel. She is a natural. I think we'll be seeing more of her in the future.

Matthew McCann who played the son, Morgan, is not an actor. He's just Sydney's big brother who came along for the ride. Do yourself a favor, little man, and go to college, get your MBA and become your little sister's accountant when you grow up.

Eric Roberts' performance as Jonathon, the therapist dad, is so over the top that halfway through the movie I just wanted to take him by the shoulders, shake him and tell him to stop it. I mean, really. His idea of playing a supportive husband and dad is to be sickly sweet and over enthused about EVERYthing. Every word he says feels forced and artificial. C'mon, Eric, I know you can do better. You should stick to type and play creepy or bad guy. Trying to be a goodie two shoes just isn't your bailiwick. And OMG, dude, get a freaking haircut, for Pete's sake. That shaggy look just isn't charming anymore.

Deborah Twiss, the oversexed mom, gave a performance that was tacky and uncomfortable. I've never seen her in anything else. I hope she does better in other venues because this is definitely not her best showing.

Cathy Moriarity, bless her soul, did the best she could with a crap character and amateur script, but even her talent was hidden under this burdensome bushel.

Everyone else was just stilted and awkward and painful to watch.

The movie:

This cumbersome piece of crap is sloppy and disjointed with abrupt, non-sequitur scene changes and monotonous music. The dialogue is boring and the story line is clumsy. Although it tried very hard to be classic, this movie is inelegant and unwieldy. It clumps and limps and drags along until the end credits are like the sweet release of death.

Even the scenery and staging are drab and unimaginative, as well as repetitive and monotonous. That marvelous house has so much potential but ends up being flat and one dimensional. Such a waste.

Overall, ""A Cry From Within"" isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it sure runs a close second."
1608,1.0,"...cause this set SUCKS!!! I may be glad to finally get all four of those movies in Widescreen format, but THE one disc is OVERCOMPRESSED as hell! It looks like whoever manufactured this disc didn't really give a crap! No special features (then again, many compilations like this don't have special features at all), no subtitles (even for the deaf and hearing impaired), and ONLY English 2.0. There's also no scene selection (the chapters are like 10 minutes each, which is a lazy choice, and then again, why should you care?). ALL OF THIS COUNTS FOR ALL THE MOVIES IN THE SET, and the movies aren't ordered correctly either (that's those compilations for you). Audio quality may be okay, but the video quality SUCKS! God, why did it have to be a MAJOR distributor to bring this to stores as THE compilation for those Pokmon movies? They would NEVER take care of these movies right. If TPCi gets the license to these movies, I will check how they would do with these movies, and possibly sell this piece of crap.

EDIT: Did I forget to mention that THE menu looks freaking horrible!?

EDIT 2: For anybody saying that I didn't purchased it from Amazon, I actually purchased it from Wal-Mart instead.

EDIT 3: I'm finishing up on the set, and from the looks of it, only 4Ever looks like crap. The rest, somehow, look decent, except for the frame-rate issues on Destiny Deoxys. I'm still keeping it one star, because I'm still an audio- and video-phile."
1609,2.0,"I think I missed something when I blinked. It was pretty slow and I could be wrong, but it seems that the guy came back only because his loved ones hadn't completely accepted his death (oh wait, so why did he wake up at end). So freaking confused and lost."

1614,5.0,"I feel awful saying this, but this was my first time watching The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. I have seen most of Dario Argentos films, but oddly enough, I never got around to watching his directorial debut. Why? I have no sweet clue, but you know what? Im glad that I waited as I was able to finally watch the film for the first time on a fantastic Blu-ray release from Arrow Video. As for the film itself, hot damn was it ever good!

REVIEW

As previously mentioned, this is Argentos first foray into directing, and I have to hand it to the guy, he sure knows how to deliver a freaking solid Giallo. The film will have you guessing all the way to the end, as you ride along with Sam Dalmas (Tony Musante), who has witnessed a murder attempt at the beginning of the film. He eventually gets roped up in trying to figure how who the killer is, as the murderer has already struck three times previously, and he may just be next on the killer hit list.

The film has all the usual trappings (not a negative) of a Giallo, with the blacked gloved killer hunting down helpless damsels in distress, with the main character, a guy, of course, being the only one who can save the day. The main guy usually has to have a girlfriend or wife who is dumb as bricks and is only present to be saved. This time around, the wife is played by Suzy Kendall, whom you may know from the films Torso or Tales that Witness Madness.

As the film is a product of its time, you do have to suffer through a few scenes that are groan inducing. The biggest being a stalking scene involving Kendall, who comes across like a trapped animal in a corner, a corner that is full of weapons to defend yourself and a big barred door to keep the killer out. Why is she screaming her head off and crawling around on the floor? Oh, because she is a blonde hottie, meant to be saved.

Nevertheless, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage cultivates a killer story that has you glued to the screen, looking for clues to who is committing the murders. No spoilers from me! If you're a fan of films like Blood and Black Lace from Mario Bava, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage is going to be right up your alley. It may feel a bit different from Argentos later efforts, with Ennio Morricone providing the soundtrack instead of Argentos go to band Goblin, and the film lacks gore, but even with these differences, this is still one of Argentos finest films.

Arrow Video continues to outshine their competition with this superb Limited Edition release of The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. Packed in a cardboard case, you receive the movie on Blu-ray and DVD, a poster of the newly commissioned artwork (alternate poster on the back side), some nice lobby cards, and an excellent lengthy booklet featuring a bunch of essays and information on the film.

Things are already looking great before you even pop in the movie on Blu-ray. Once you do, you are treated to a stupendously upgraded viewing experience. The Bird with the Crystal Plumage has never looked this good (as this is my first time seeing the film, I can only say this because of caps-a-holic's wonderful comparison page). The colours are darker and more natural than previous Blu-ray releases. A lot of debris and scratches have been cleaned up, and the overall all viewing experience is highly enjoyable. As for the audio experience, the film provides you with both an English and Italian (English SDH subtitled) Lossless soundtrack. The film was dubbed post-production, so there are synching issues, which is common. I found the English track a bit louder in regards to dialogue, but either option is an absolutely acceptable listening experience.

After youve watched the movie, you can expect to dive into a healthy supply of special features. You have a bunch of interviews, which all are rather lengthy but never boring. The newly shot interview with Dario Argento is a big bonus. Also provided is an audio commentary with Troy Howarth, author of So Deadly, So Perverse: 50 Years of Italian Giallo Films. Rounding out the features are some trailers. Special feature fans will be pleased with this release, but I do have to wonder why there is no new audio commentary with Dario Argento.

VERDICT

The Bird with the Crystal Plumage is where it all started for Dario Argento, and unlike some directors, his first film is fantastic. His talent for the deadly mystery is very much evident in this early work of his, and the film provides us with a story that is worth watching over and over. What better way than with Arrow Videos sublime Limited Edition Blu-ray release."
1615,5.0,My boyfriend bought this for me when he got taxes and I freaking love it. Huge fan of the show so this made my day. It's in excellent shape and was shipped super fast. if you know someone who loves the show then this will make a great present
1616,1.0,"I was hoping this would be a fun little adventure, with Chris Hemsworth to look at, but was so disappointed.  I could only make it through about half the movie.  The writing was obvious, the plot was ridiculous (seriously - you release a hacker from federal prison, and then use him like James freaking Bond?).  The ""romance"" was contrived, the bad guy was predictable and cartoonish.  This movie was written by a 5th grader during lunch hour.  So horribly written.  And the worse part - Hemsworth spoke in a flat American accent.  I didn't even get to listen to his lovely voice.  What a waste of my money and my time."
1617,5.0,"If like a rip roaring comedy you can do no better than this pic!! These guys worked so dang well together it was freaking awesome!!
Truly they even managed to bring home a message of friendship on down in the middle of all that belly busting laughter.
You surely will not be disappointed!!"
1618,4.0,"It's rated R for a reason....so use caution what audience you share it with. Other than that, this movie was freaking hilarious!! What a concept...a ""wedding ringer""!! And the dancing scene had me doing belly laughs...felt good to laugh so hard!! "
1619,4.0,"As far as an action war movie goes this is pretty good. Lots of realistic gun battles and fire fights. Now I'm no expert on Chris Kyle and what he did in Iraq or what happened to him over there, but I've seen enough movies to know that a lot of this movie is probably Hollywood. Things like everytime he's talking to his wife on that satellite phone he's in the middle of a fire fight. One time he drops the phone and she listens to it as it's happening and she's freaking out. I'm not saying that this has never happend to anyone, but I smell Hollywood. Why can't they ever just tell an accurate story of a real event(s)!!!"
1620,5.0,people are dying every day and americans just don't care. to accomplish what he did and survive what he survived only to die at the hands of a fellow veteran he was trying to help makes me freaking sick to my stomach. hats off to eastwood who turned out another excellent film.
1621,5.0,Best freaking vampire parody movie...ever! I love Jemaine and Taika. Truly masters of dry comedy. This movie I an absolute must own film. 
1622,5.0,"So freaking funny in a fresh, creative way!!! This Mockumentary won uber wards for its clever approach to the secret lives of vampires rooming together. The mundanity of life transforms into bright laughter when it's a vampire complaining about roommates who don't do dishes when it's been their turn for 200 years. Throw in a bevy of werewolves (""Remember guys, we're werewolves, not swearwolves"") and, well...you can see how it goes. Good all around fun."
1623,5.0,This movie is freaking hilarious. Loved it. Made everyone in the room laugh out loud.
1624,1.0,"I purchased  Season nine and season 10 from Amazon ,worst freaking purchase ever !!!!all the episodes are the exactly the same on season nine and season 10 discs.  I don't get how that could happen they are labeled season nine and then they're labeled season 10 but all the episodes are exactly the same on both seasons !!!!!!so I basically got ripped off. I am so angry"
1625,5.0,"Season 2  is  everything season one  should  have  been!  the  characters  have  even  more  interesting  backstories,  the  stakes  and  drama  are  much  more  intense. Claudia Black  as  this  season's villian  is  freaking awesome! I  loved  this character  so much  that  i was  pissed  that  they  killed  her  off.  Season  2  is  awesome  hopefully  season  3 will  take notes."
1626,5.0,"I freaking love this show!!!!!!!!! The animation and are style is amazing and better than most of today's shows! I love the charaters. My favorate is blitz because he sounds like Arnold  Schwarzenegger and I love that detail. Hunter reminds me of my dog and its a good detail. It has an amazing story line and very played out. Warner Bros, renew this show for another season and REPLACE UNCLE GRANPA's time slot on Cartoon Network!!!!!!!!!!!"
1627,5.0,I've been wanting to see this for a whole and it was so worth hunting it down and watching it. Its so outrageous you can not believe its true. At the end I did kinda wonder if he wasn't playing for the mic No way hes that intelligent and then that stupid to forget the mic was on I MEAN Really. The filming and the production is freaking amazing makes me want to be come a film maker so bad.
1628,4.0,"I freaking loved this movie.  I am so tempted to give it 5 stars, but there are some elements that are missing.  The overwhelming premise of the movie is the war on terror and what is acceptable collateral damage.  MOST humans aren't wired to kill other humans and this takes it's toll on the human psyche.  Especially when some Taliban leader is taken out along with a woman and child; is this justifiable?  American lives are saved, in theory.

Ethan Hawke was perfect for this roll.  He nailed it.  There was another (I'm not sure she was an officer) Suarez who worked in ""the sweatbox with Tommy Egan ""Hawke.""  The chemistry between these two was so thick you could cut it with a knife. I did not realize that she was Zoe Kravitz.  Egan's wife, Molly, from ""Mad Men,"" I can't say that they had great chemistry.  She is a wonderful actor, but the role could have been better picked.  Maybe this was intentional.  Every Air Force crewman was trying to do the right thing and had to deal with taking orders and pushing a button to kill people that were a possible threat.  These are orders that may have gone against their better judgement.  However, in the military you do not question your superiors.

The ending felt rushed and although I was able to discern what was happening, I don't think it was done properly.  I don't want to say anymore.  This may not be best, but it's one of my favorite movies I watched this year.  I think the 6.4 IMDB rating was a little low."
1629,4.0,"Originally titled Savaged, but now goes by the title Avenged.

This is a violent Grindhouse style horror that bleeds, somewhat the concept of, I Spit on your Grave, The Last House on the Left and all those others, but also mixes the concept of a supernatural element. The concept of the raped and brutalized woman has been done a thousand times before, and so, it is unoriginal, but don't go into it thinking that way, because I felt this movie, really came together as a solid supernatural rape, revenge tale. Yes, this has the plot of a raped woman/revenge reality of the 70's and 80's and even today, but that is not the whole plot. It adds a unique and interesting and in my viewpoint an awesome fresh concept to this tired and overdone story.

The makeup, special effects and gore is top notch and utterly fantastic. They do an amazing job in that department. It looked real, and even spots made me feel, the hurt and pain. The violence is brutal, and the supernatural element to the plot, was spot on interesting, and very unique, and original through the Native American spirit reality.

It's about freaking time the white man pays. Oh wait I am white. Well the white man of the past deserves the revenge of all those Natives, lied to, and fallen, to the brutality of the evil racist, white man of the past.

1630,4.0,"Many an SNL alum has walked away with hopes of turning their work on the small screen into big screen careers, but few have done it quite as well as Kristen Wiig in such a short amount of time. Bridesmaids was sort of like her big coming out party, but after refusing a sequel she's embarked on a number of smaller projects that allow her to flex rarely-used dramatic muscles. The Skeleton Twins is an excellent example of what she can do, while others like Hateship Loveship and Girl Most Likely lacked the inventive spark we're used to from her. Rest assured that is not an issue with the Shira Piven's hilariously wacky and touching Welcome to Me, a showcase for what Wiig can do when put front and center.

Unlike some of the larger films she's been a part of recently, Wiig essentially carries Welcome to Me all by herself. That's not to say the supporting cast, which consists of James Marsden, Joan Cusack, Alan Tudyk, Linda Cardellini, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Tim Robbins, are ineffectual it's just a statement on how good Wiig is. She plays Alice Klieg, a lonely recluse who watches old episodes of Oprah on VHS, stays up late watching shows on parakeets, and basically watching too much TV in general. In fact, her television hasn't been off in 11 years. Diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, Alice attends therapy sessions with Dr. Moffat (Tim Robbins), although she's recently decided to quit her meds in favor of a string cheese treatment. She has a best friend in Gina (Cardellini) but little else to her name, it seems. That all changes drastically when she hits the lotto and instantly becomes a mega-millionaire.

Rather than freaking out, Alice calmly makes the decision to reinvent herself as a talk show host, relying on Oprah's sage advice about self-confidence in the pursuit of one's dreams. Falling in with a low-rent television network barely above the UHF level, she agrees to pay them $15M to produce her own show, ""Welcome to Me"", so that she can talk all about herself. And what a show it turns out to be. The segments are an oddball assortment of reenacted events from Alice's cracked past, like ""Smelling Things Before They Happen"" and ""Someone Has Been Tampering With My Makeup Bag"". Or they delve into even darker, crueler territory such as the entire week Alice spends neutering dogs live on air. All this after she enters the show riding a mechanical swan, of course. The depths of Alice's narcissism (she often reads from formal prepared statements) know no bounds, and it never ceases to be funny, especially when the people around her (mostly the network employees) are left stupefied by it. The reactions on their faces looked exactly like mine watching Alice's unpredictable exploits; her moments of serenity that flip like a switch to utter insanity. There were times when I found myself yelling at the screen over her antics. A health nut (sorta), Alice's nutritional cooking segments end with long stretches where she simply sits down and eats on camera...in total silence, to stunned audiences.

Of course, Alice's show gains a following, but popularity has the drastic effect of increasing her self-delusion. But it also reveals the depth of her pain and loneliness, her extreme need for acceptance. She falls in love with practically every man who shows her any attention, from a sheepish infomercial host (Wes Bentley) to a young student (Thomas Mann) who adores the show.  Wiig is phenomenal here, showing Alice's growing confidence which coincides with the depth of her mental illness. We both pity her and root for her, but never once do we come to dislike Alice for some of the questionable choices she makes. The film loses some of its edge in an attempt to make sure Alice comes away smelling like a rose, but that is a small problem when she's such an original comic creation already. It's also good to see Wiig carrying the full comedic weight without having to share it with a male co-star. This is Wiig at her absolute best, and we can only hope she gets more chances like this to show what she can do."
1631,1.0,"Jennifer Aniston has all the acting range of a hubcap. This woman couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. She can barely hold her own in comedies, and she just keeps playing Rachel from Friends. Over and over and freaking over. Her in a drama, any drama, is just laughable. This movie would have been seriously heavy and good if a real actress had been cast in the lead role. Like Meryl Streep, Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron, Sandra Bullock, Julianne Moore, Jessica Chastain, Uma Thurman, Vera Farmiga, etc. Don't waste your time and money on yet another one of Aniston's pet production projects that she does to try and show she ""can really act"", she even ditched the makeup and went ugly trying to go the Charlize Theron"" Monster"" route, which didn't work, because she has no range or depth. She just has too much money & time on her hands, not to mention unwarranted fame. She has never carried a hit movie by herself, for good reason. She is never cast in anything serious or dramatic that isn't owned by her own production company, for good reason. She has never been recognized by her peers and nominated for an Academy Award, for good reason. She only gets more attention than her Friends costars because she's a tabloid fixture due to being married to Brad Pitt and she goes on lots of tropical vacations and makes sure the paparazzi gets pictures of her in bikinis.
It's a shame. Could have been a great movie. Don't waste 90 minutes of your life that you can't get back on this stinker."

1633,2.0,"A certain type of person watches Hallmark movies and is happy with them. I admit right now, I am not that kind of person. But this movie I thought was odd even for a Hallmark movie. Rachel Boston is a perfect lead for a romantic movie. She appears, pretty, approachable, and bright. I bought her as someone who was a business consultant and also someone ambivalent about marriage. She really doesn't need anything that traditional marriage can bring to the table.  But after seeing a fortune teller who tells her she will never marry if she doesn't get a ring by spring... I can see anyone freaking a bit. While all this is going on she is working with a great guy at her job Tom Halsey the CEO of the company she is analyzing. Throughout the entire movie she likes Tom but isn't really attracted it seems. As usual for a Hallmark movie there doesn't seem to be anything really awesome about Tom. He is nice but not exactly a looker and seems completely lost as to how to get a woman interested in him. He is just kind of ""there"" and not too objectionable.  Tom of course likes Caryn, but never seriously makes more than a half hearted move (probably because she has a boyfriend). After all the strife over the fortune she comes to believe she is not destined to marry and breaks it off with her boyfriend who she doesn't really like that much anyway. She is happy and content. Movie over right? Nope. She runs into the fortune teller who tells her that wasn't the lesson she was supposed to learn and then, Caryn comes to conclude Tom is the love of her life. Movie over. Err ok. I couldn't help feeling annoyed. She is out of Tom's league and it appears like she is just settling due to some fortune teller telling her to get married."
1634,4.0,"A RING BY SPRING is a romantic comedy that aired on the Hallmark Channel in 2014, and I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. It's fluff but fun. It stars Rachel Boston as Caryn Briggs, a 30-year-old business consultant whose career trumps her love life. Caryn is something of a cynic and someone who is committment-phobic. She confesses to having been the only 12-year-old girl to not swoon over Romeo & Juliet. 12-year-old Caryn was aghast that Juliet would throw her life away just for love. Grown-up years later, the wake-up call comes when, one evening, at a charity fundraiser, on a whim, Caryn and her pals Gregg (Chad Krowchuk) and Stephanie (Ali Liebert) saunter over to get a reading (at $10 a pop) from one of the event's featured attractions, that gypsy fortuneteller Madame Roue (Stefanie Powers).

Caryn is all scoffy at what Madame Roue's got in store for her: ""You will receive a ring by spring... or you will never marry."" But, then, the soothsayer's predictions about her friends start coming true. And there's Caryn freaking out a bit. She's channeling John Cusack from HIGH FIDELITY as she embarks on a stint of soul-searching. Doesn't help that her boyfriend's just dumped her over dinner. He claims she's not marriage material. He's maybe not wrong.

Into Caryn's dark cloud comes the silver lining in the shape of new client Tom Halsey (Kirby Morrow), good-natured CEO of an online surplus business. He's hired her to figure out why his once thriving enterprise is now at a standstill. Now, this is the Hallmark Channel, guys, so I think you can play merry matchmaker from here on out.

A RING BY SPRING continuously shifts between bubbly and angsty, and it's good that Rachel Boston looks striking and comes across as accessible. It's a predictable plotline. Hallmark's not the sort to toss you a curve. It relies on your craving for what's comfy and safe and familiar, and those aren't bad things to crave occasionally. The only suspense centers on if (when) Caryn gets that marriage proposal. It's an affable enough cast. Stefanie Powers is the biggest name on the credits, and she makes the most of her two scenes. A RING BY SPRING won't surprise you, but it may entertain you. And maybe, for that young someone out there, this'll be the first movie they'll see that showcases that age-old bromide about putting yourself out there to take a chance on love. That someone won't know that this movie's beating a dead, old horse."
1635,2.0,"So where to do we begin. Tom is going to the beach minding his own business when Tyke comes along and barks at the unsuspecting Tom. This introduces the running gag of Tom flipping out anytime a dog barks at him. After Tom calms down we are then introduced to Jerry who is also at the beach. Jerry sets up his spot unbeknownst to Tom who sets up his beach spot right in Jerry's sun. Well, Jerry is having none of that and decides to poke Tom with a sharp object thus setting up the rivalry and the back and forth battles with each other. Jerry is kind of a jerk in this instance. During the ensuing chase we meet up with Johnny Quest and his pals. Bandit freaks out Tom with his barking and Johnny apologizes right before these new pals are attacked by three flying hench cats that seem to be rather familiar (*see Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes).

Poor Tom, he's just wanting to mind his business. The Hench cats begin chasing Quest and our duo when Tom is startled by Bandit's barking again. This barking causes Tom to freak out and become this ultimate fighting machine that takes out the Hench cats. This bit with Tom freaking out reminds me of the old Three Stooges short where Curly becomes this unstoppable force when ""Three Blind Mice"" is played...am I showing my age here...yeesh! Anyway, Quest and our duo make their escape with the help of Race Bannon.

After the get away we are introduced to the villain, Dr. Zin (voiced by the awesome James Hong) and the Hench cats and find out his plans to capture Dr. Quest, which if I recall correctly was the premise of every Johnny Quest cartoon. I already have a beef with the Hench cats because they introduce one of them as are ""Rainman"" type and I just can't stand that cliche'.

Really like how they updated the original Johnny Quest intro to include Tom and Jerry. Very fun sequence, would love to have seen an entire episode done that way. After this we end up in Quest labs and find out why Dr. Zin is wanting Dr. Quest. Dr. Quest shows off his latest invention, a Q-sphere that can solve the world's energy crisis and the thing that Dr. Zin is most likely after for some nefarious purpose. A couple mishaps at Tom's expense and we are off to dinner. Unfortunately, a very hungry Tom is given a skimpy dinner, which causes him to be Hangry. In the middle of the night, hungry Tom gets up and futzes with some buttons by a door so that he can get something to eat and inadvertently such the security system down. This leaves the lab vulnerable to an attack from the Hench cats.

The Hench cats arrive while Tom is trying desperately to eat something while Jerry is preventing him from doing so. The cats and mouse begin to fight in the lab. The commotion gets the attention of Quest and gang but the Hench cats get away with the Sphere, Dr. Quest, and Race. Now the kids and Tom and Jerry make plans to rescue Dr. Quest, Race, and the Q-sphere. The adventure begins.

Off the gang races to find Dr. Quest, cut to the Dr. Zin's lair and I have no words for how bad this bit of villain and Hench cats are so I'll move on. The Quest jet is on the way and are attacked by Robot Drone Missiles, Tom freaks out a bit from Bandit's barking, ugh. The Jet crashes and they all make it out safely and land in Moldovistan. The heroes make it to town where they are chased by goons and rescued by Race's old flame, Jezebel Jade a mercenary/club owner. They go to Jade's club, where a belly dancer is on stage performing, and strike a deal for her helping our heroes.

Off the heroes go in Jade's hovercraft while Jade goes on stage to perform. GAH! Droppy is singing! SINGING!!! WHY, WB? WHY!...sigh...so during Jade's song, the goons are thwarted and our heroes escape to Dr. Zin's lair only to get caught be Dr. Zin. Okay, I love the fact that Dr. Zin's lair is in a volcano.

So Tom and Jerry have managed not to get themselves captured, while Quest and crew have. Dr. Quest is forced to set up the Q Sphere in Dr. Zin's volcano that seems to be a ""Battle Island"" that can fly. Back in the dungeon, Bandit is levitated by Hadji to a vent where his going to find Tom and Jerry. I can see the barking coming into play for Tom at some point.

Okay, we have some exposition about Race and Jade, Dr. Zin and Dr. Quest's back story right before the Q Sphere is activated and the island rises in the air and flies straight to Washington, D.C. As the island flies toward its destination, the heroes escape from captivity and try to foil Dr. Zin's plans. What follows is lots of chasing and fights. Tom ends up using his freak out from dog barks to lay waste robots, Hench cats and eventually Dr. Zin. However, Dr. Zin manages to escape. The Dr. Quest eventually takes out the flying volcano island with a convenient missile that was hiding under the Washington Monument. However, our heroes can't make it off the island, but they get rescued by Jade and Droopy (who was keeping a watchful, distant eye on our heroes) and everything is back to better now. Our heroes get a medal from the President, voiced by the original Johnny Quest.

The Good:
I'm afraid that I really don't have much good to say about this latest Tom and Jerry meets someone. I've watched this movie  twice now and I can't find much to like about it except for the really nice beginning credits. I wish this whole movie was animated like the opening title sequence as the animation was raw and energetic. A great throwback to animation of old. I'm convinced that it was a play on the old opening sequence from the original Johnny Quest cartoons.

The only other good thing that I could say about it was the comment the President made when the Washington Monument missile launched. That got a great big chuckle out of me. The President, in the Oval office, looks out to see the Washington Monument lift off and says to his people, ""Why wasn't I told about this?"". It was delivered in such a deadpan way that it was funny to me.

The Bad:
Le sigh....where to begin. The animation was really jerky and too exaggerated at times. It didn't feel consistent to me and it wasn't smooth like what I think of with Tom and Jerry cartoons. I couldn't put my finger on why until after the second viewing when I finally realized that this Tom and Jerry Spy Quest is really more of a Johnny Quest movie guest staring Tom and Jerry. Unlike some of the previous outings with Tom and Jerry the cartoon's theme's were of a younger audience, within the first 8 minutes you could definitely tell this was for a much older audience. Particularly the sand mermaid scene with Tom and the dance number with Jade *shudder*. Hence my saying this is more of a Johnny Quest movie than Tom and Jerry.

Dr. Zin. I don't watch much Johnny Quest so I'm not really familiar with his character, but a caricature like that character in 2015 should probably raise an eyebrow or two....moving on.

Jerry is kind of a real jerk to Tom in this one. Tom wasn't paying much attention when he covered Jerry's beach spot, which set Jerry off to attack Tom. So a simple mistake pretty much ruined Tom's day with Jerry decided that Tom's his new hobby. Every time Tom tries to eat or get away, Jerry is always there to starve him or put Tom in harms way. It got old after awhile.

Gah, the tired cliche of some goon as the Dustin Hoffman ""Rainman"" character. Please, stop with this character. It's overdone.

The Ugly:
Okay...Why is Tom such a sniveling scared cat that turns into this berserker fighter when a dog barks at him. Seriously! Any time a dog barks, and there is always some dog that barks at him, Tom is triggered into this blind, hysterical rage. It's played for laughs more often than not and it comes in handy rather conveniently in spots. The worst offense is when Tom is trying to get the courage to fight the Hench cats at the end, but can't do it unless a reluctant, confused Bandit barks at him.

WTF! Why must Droopy always make a cameo in a Tom and Jerry movie? Some please explain this to me? I've come to loathe seeing Droopy in any of these recent cartoons. Don't get me wrong here, I LOVED the original Droopy cartoons when they were done by TEX AVERY, separate from Tom and Jerry. These Droopy cameos are a taint from the Tom and Jerry Kids cartoon era, it's the only explanation I have for why he keeps showing up in Tom and Jerry movies. And another thing: Droopy singing! It was awful...terrible...it was part of the Jezebel Jade number which was ridiculous in and of itself and certainly not for kids under 12. Totally out of place for a Tom and Jerry cartoon.

Overall, this wasn't bad for a Johnny Quest movie, but this was a terrible Tom and Jerry film. It's definitely for older kids who like Johnny Quest. I'm not a huge Johnny Quest fan, I watched a few cartoons here and there over the years and never got into it. As a Tom and Jerry cartoon it was lacking. Jerry is an aggressive mouse that's really abusive to Tom and Tom is kind of a complacent punching bag that just wanted to mind his own business."
1636,4.0,"Pretty damn good. Good action, good story, good fight scenes. And as a side note, How THE HELL the Sean get so freaking RIPPED and SHREDDED for this movie!!??"
1637,3.0,"After all these years I feel cheated these DVDs are not complete these are edited syndication episodes all the cuss words are there but this was an HBO series, original show lasted 28 to 30 minutes these are 23 or 22 minutes. It's a ripoff, Gary Shandling is a disturbed man now a freaking liar. Don't buy not worth it."
1638,5.0,"Finally!  A sci-fi film for THINKING people.  No zombies, no vampires, no super-naturual garbage, no Transformers, no Star Trek and ... no freaking Marvel comic book junk!

Solid classical cerebral science fiction, in the same league as 2001: A Space Odyssey.  OMG, the movie actually had some real science! True, if you're an evolutionary biologist, a neurologist, or even just have a good understanding of general chemistry, there were a few things that might cause you to wince. A number of scientific concepts were stretched a bit, but that's what good sci-fi does; it pushes the boundaries of known science and theoretical science without sliding into to the realm of ridiculous fantasy.

Don't be fooled by the somewhat cliche innocent-girl-gets-revenge-against-bad-guys storyline that unfolds in the first 20 minutes; by the time the film ends, you'll have forgotten all that and be totally focused on something WAY deeper!  I won't give spoilers to those who've yet to see this work, but I did NOT see the ending coming, what unfolded was a pleasant surprise.  Ms. Johannson did an excellent job depicting the various stages of Lucy's -- uh -- ""development"" from a ditzy zoned-out blond into something other-worldy.

Yeah, there were quite a few gigantic plot holes but I was having some much fun watching I didn't really notice them all that much until the 2nd & 3rd viewing.  Also could have done with a whole lot less gratuitous violence, the obligatory car chase was kinda cool, though -- reminded me of the ""French Connection"", ""Bullet"" and ""The Blues Brothers"".

As other reviewers have pointed out, the film did make use of certain themes from a number of sci-fi classics ( primarily Dune, 2001 and  Fifth Element),  but does so in a good way; if you spot them, just smile and enjoy the moment.  As far as I can tell, the film's ""punchline""  (given in the final minutes) turned out to be something fairly unique for a sci-fi film.  If  you ever read Arthur C. Clark's classic ""Childhood's End"" (required reading for the true hardcore sci-fi geek) , then you'll enjoy the film ""Lucy""."
1639,1.0,"This movie has great potential...but never quite lives up to it.  Most of ""Lucy"" is pretty good...about 3.5 stars..but the ending just leaves you going, ""Huh?""  Its like someone had a pretty good concept in mind but couldn't figure out what to do with it.  You would have thout SOMEONE along the way would have told him, ""Its a good idea except your ending makes no freaking sense!""  Save your $5...I wish I had."
1640,2.0,"Eh.  I mean it was creepy and sort of original.  But people in horror movies are always so dumb. The premise is that once you have sex with someone this ghost will slowly follow you (walking from wherever it is), and stalk you until it kills you or you have sex with someone else,  passing on the curse.  The whole movie could have been resolved any of the cursed characters booked a flight to Amsterdam and sprung for a decent prostitute.  By the time ""it"" made its way to Holland,  ""it"" would have appointments all over the freaking globe.  The characters would have easily bought themselves 40-50 years."
1641,5.0,"Time and time again I learn (especially with low-budget horror movies) to completely distrust Amazon ratings. This movie is no exception.

""It Follows"" is the kind of horror movie Spielberg might make if he ever decided to make a horror movie. And I'm not talking about modern Spielberg (bombastic mega-nonsense like ""Super 8"" [I mean seriously, Spielberg has lost it lately; and yes, I realize Abrams directed S8 but the point stands--just look at War of the Worlds), no--I'm talking about the gritty, hungry Spielberg who made ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duel/dp/B00RNV4MDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duel</a>"" with Dennis Weaver and the scary truck. Or maybe this movie reminds me of J.J. Abrams back when he was directing movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joy-Ride/dp/B001F63D4I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joy Ride</a>."" Basically, if M. Night Shyamalan, Steven Spielberg, and John Carpenter ever got together (when they were all way younger, hungrier directors) and made a movie based on one of R.L. Stine's Fear Street books, they would have made ""It Follows.""

I just love movies where kids get to be in charge. Parents are essentially nowhere to be found so it's up to the teenagers to figure out how to get out of the mess. This conceit is what make movies like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disturbia/dp/B000W9DVHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disturbia</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unfriended/dp/B013QOHWOS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unfriended</a>"" so much fun to watch. We were all kids once and we can all relate to how a bunch of teenagers might react if they had some monster chasing them. It's a lot of fun. Remember ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T-The-Extra-Terrestrial/dp/B00BP4ZNFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T.,The Extra-Terrestrial</a>?"" Same idea. Fun because we get to be the kids again.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Follows-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/dp/B00TYGJ3NQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Follows (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)</a>&nbsp;is really the showpiece and big surprise in this movie. It's pure old-school John Carpenter and stands out among perhaps any soundtrack I've heard in the last ten years. The composer, Disasterpiece, is a ""chiptune"" artist and he seems to have recorded the entire soundtrack in a few weeks after school or work using sound chips from 8-bit video games from the late '80's and '90's. That gives the whole move a heavy ""synth-bass"" sound that reminds you of ""Halloween"" and the original (NOT the remake) ""Assault on Precinct 13."" For a first time film composer (he'd only been doing video games up to this point) Disasterpiece created a simply outstanding and original piece of work. I watched the movie again JUST to listen to the soundtrack and then got into the whole chiptune music genre which is actually quite excellent music if you grew up playing the NES and SNES or Final Fantasy VII; basically if you're between 27 and 32 years old.

The directing and cinematography blew me away for a microbudget film. It's like the director graduated from film school, absorbed all the idiosyncrasies of M. Night (lots of long shots; lots of visual symmetry; a very consistent gloomy suburban look and feel), and then found a cinematographer who could match his wits. The result is visually beautiful and desolate and freaking scary.

Maika Monroe (the main actress who plays Jay) is one of those women who is not exactly drop-dead bombshell gorgeous; but she is very compelling to watch on screen and quite captivating and pretty in a torn-down-but-strong-willed way. She kinda reminds me of Brittany Murphey like that; and she even looks like Brittany Murphey in that washed out dirty blonde girl-next-door way. I get the feeling she's a really new actress (I think she comes from sports or something) and she's humble about her lack of facility with the craft by completely underplaying the part and delivering the lines without too much embellishment. It works and I was very appreciative that she just delivered the d*** lines without trying to impress anyone. I saw her in another movie after this one called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Guest/dp/B00R2KMGN0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Guest</a>"" (also really good horror/thriller movie) and she did a great job in that movie too.

I wrote this review because this movie is getting trashed by other reviewers and I wonder whether we were watching the same film. Of course that's rhetorical: I know we were watching the same movie but I imagine they went into the movie expecting something they didn't find. Since I never heard of the movie until I watched it I had no preconceptions and enjoyed the film so much I bought it. If you aren't pretentious about your low-budget horror movies and want to watch a teen-scare Halloween and popcorn horror movie with high production values and an outstanding soundtrack, rent or buy this movie. If you like this movie, also take a look at ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Skies/dp/B00BEIYG98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Skies</a>"" with Keri Russell and the above-mentioned ""The Guest"" which also stars Maika Monroe."
1642,5.0,Unfreakingbelievable!! Love it!
1643,5.0,I freaking love this show!!!
1644,5.0,Jiminy Crickets........ I freaking LOVE this show!!!!!!!!!!!! The best ever.........
1645,5.0,It is freaking Game of Thrones! It is amazing and each season is better than the last.
1646,5.0,"Lord of the Rings for grownups. Brilliant writing, casting, cinematography, costumes, set design, special effects and acting. Totally immersive. Some of the best written dialogue -- much of it witty and laugh-out-loud funny -- ever to appear on any screen of whatever size. Shot with the verve and scale of a Hollywood Technicolor movie of old. A lot of swordplay, grizzly deaths, bloodshed and sex. But all of it excellently choreographed and photographed, with much of the action being unexpected and engrossing. G.O.T. is a fully realized alternate time, place and world. And it has lots of smart things to say about power, politics, ambition, the human heart and the human species capacity for both cruelty and nobility. Also, the supernatural creatures (White Walkers, e.g.) are vivid and realistic, and the dragons, onscreen neither too much nor too little, are freaking awesome!"
1647,4.0,"Yes, I can agree that the start and finish of this season feels strange and even close to disappointing.  Sansa's situation, the underwhelming Dorne side of the story, the build up for Arya finally reaching the House of black and White, others parts involving from book to screen changes....and that season finale..It will rub the wrong way for many fans of the book series and the HBO series. Im not a devout fan of the book material, and Ive actually gone out and defended some changes like the Hounds fate. The season does finally pick up after the 7th episode and each one after pack an emotional punch that feel like you are constantly going up and down on a roller coaster.

After the supremely negative 6th, out of freaking nowhere, episode 7 and 8 remind you why Game of Thrones is still ONE OF THE BEST TV shows ever conceived. 7 finally pushes the narrative forward with key story elements from the novels Feast for Crows and Dance of Dragons. The 8th episode, titled ""Hard Home,"" pushes it even more and delivered One of the best episodes of the show's entirety. Usually its the 9th episode of each season that personifies the most shocking and remembered events from the books. I'm not saying HBO changed that method. The 9th had me grinning like a kid on Christmas. However,  ""Hard Home was the God(s)Send the audience needed for this show.  I pre-ordered a Blu-Ray copy of this season immediately after watching it on my small tablet through HBOGO. It was if the TV show runners said ""you know what, were gonna show this event anyway and remind the audience of what the real threat is."" Yes, this is part of the book to screen changes, but this 100% worked! The final 30 minutes of that ""Hard Home"" were as close as a Warcraft or Neverwinter Nights fan will ever get to see undead terror in live action format. With amazing CGI effects and stunt action, I'm so glad David Benioff and D.B. Weiss chose to have this epic scene happen. Then episode 10.... I'm not going into detail about it. I'm still trying to wrap my head on what I watched. Not to reveal too much, it's not a happy end, but more perplexing. Just watch it for yourself.

Once again, Blu-Ray is the only way to watch this amazing show. I still wished these seasons still included a DVD copy of the season so I can share with my family who still do not have aBlu-Ray player. I'm excited to watch the making of "" Hard Home"" and probably any other spectacular scenes of the season. If you looked hard enough, Mastodon fans, you can notice some familiar wildlings. Im always looking forward to my animated history of Westeros and Essos narrated by the shows characters as well. Also, and hopefully, there will be some  character reasoning or discussion from both George R R Martin and the show creators. I doubt they will go into super detail, BUT SOME FORM OF ANSWERS WOULD BE NICE!
Here's hoping the show can recover from the gut punches at the end of this season. Okay, GRRM or HBO, It's time to give us some closure."
1648,5.0,"What a ridiculous year for movies 2012 has already been and we still have eight months of it left to look forward to. Just look at some of this year's big releases: a new Pixar film with a female lead, Christopher Nolan's final trip to Gotham City, Ridley Scott's return to the sci-fi genre, Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth, and reboots of our friendly neighborhood web slinger and one of the better Philip K. Dick adaptations. And that's just scratching the surface.

Marvel has had something up their sleeve for quite some time though. A gargantuan superhero project they've been teasing since 2008 in five different movies that fan boys and comic book geeks have been foaming at the mouth for featuring one of the most star-studded casts the likes of any movie has ever seen before. That's right, boys and girls; The Avengers is finally upon us.

I was riding high on everything Joss Whedon since I'm still feeling the after-effects of the jaw-dropping greatness that is The Cabin in the Woods. However, I refused to get excited for The Avengers. I had doubts that mostly resided in every character getting the appropriate amount of screen time. That and every ounce of anticipation in my body is currently invested in both Prometheus and The Dark Knight Rises. The Avengers wasted little time taking full advantage of that.

The movie is explosive right from the very first scene and throughout its entirety. The special effects are incredible. With its rather massive budget ($220 million, a number they nearly made back in international ticket sales alone before it even had the chance to hit the states), it's fantastic to see that they've spared no expense making The Avengers look and sound absolutely phenomenal. The technology used in the film is insane, as well. The tesseract and everything otherworldly will probably be the first thing that comes to mind, but SHIELD has some really amazing devices as does Tony Stark. All of it is just dripping with style.

You couldn't ask for better performances from the cast. The Avengers thrives on these clashing personalities and you can't help but get sucked into it. Much of the action is these well-known superheroes fighting amongst themselves and beating the snot out of each other in the process. These are some of the best scenes in the movie, especially when Thor (Chris Hemsworth) first shows up. It's only topped by when Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) first turns into The Hulk.

I'm not the biggest Hulk fan, although I did enjoy The Incredible Hulk from 2008. I can say with confidence that he has never been this glorious. He is arguably the highlight of The Avengers. He does some pretty innovative things with the destruction he leaves behind and one scene in particular that he shares with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) will leave you with the urge to stand up and cheer.

Everybody is going to be drawn to somebody different in the action packed extravaganza. Aside from The Hulk, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is freaking great. He steals nearly every scene he's a part of by basically just being himself and everything that comes out of his mouth is hilarious. Joss Whedon is able to squeeze in these little bits of humor when you're least expecting it that helps makes things endlessly entertaining at all times. Like the guy playing Galaga, Captain America trying to convince two cops to give him a perimeter, or Thor mentioning Loki was adopted. Tom Hiddleston continues to be impressive, as well. I thought he did a fine job in Thor, but upped his game in The Deep Blue Sea. His return to the Loki character is almost majestic in this evil super villain sense. Loki is downright ferocious at times. His scene with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is magnificently menacing.

It is downright ridiculous that a superhero movie is not only this good, but is pretty much already in the books. The summer movie season has officially started and it feels like nothing will ever be able to measure up to this. That means that this year is going to be downright marvelous for movies or studios are going to pull the trigger a little too early. The truth is that you can't scream enough praise for this movie. Its two hours and twenty minute runtime goes by in the blink of an eye, its cast is astounding, its special effects are beautiful, and there are a few really dynamic camera angles thrown in for good measure. The Avengers is easily the best and most action packed movie in Marvel's arsenal.

Be sure you stay through the credits; ALL the way through the credits. There are a few surprises to enjoy hidden in there. Earth's mightiest heroes have been given the exceptional treatment they truly deserve that will demand repeat viewings. All that's really left to be said is that The Dark Knight Rises and The Amazing Spider-Man certainly have their work cut out for them."
1649,5.0,"Great 3D, great movie. The freaking Avengers, watch it now if you haven't seen it, that's about all I should have to say."
1650,4.0,"I really do not understand all the poor reviews for this. Knowing it was social media based I decided to watch it on my monitor instead of on a large screen TV.  And like they did I watched it alone. It was freaking scary!
 I really thought they did it well. now lot of the reviews are saying that that it was too confusing. well I suppose if you're not used to sitting at a computer with about a half a dozen screens up at once, it could be confusing. but to anyone used to sitting at a computer, talking to people, and doing multiple other things it kind of made perfect sense.
 now I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie to the computer non literate. but I don't think that was its target audience to begin with.
 But if you are just a tiny bit afraid of finding ghosts in your machine... I think you'll like this. but make sure you watch it in the dark and on your computer monitor. you'll  feel like you're part of the chat and it gets much scarier that way. Lol"
1651,2.0,"Oh my. By all accounts this should have been great. It has some great ideas. It has some great visuals. It has good actors and performances. It's from Brad freaking Bird! This should have been awesome. Instead it is an overstuffed mess of conflicting plot points, characters, explosions, robots and plumbing. Like they took all the little post it notes on the wall of brainstorming and insisted each and every one of them had to be in it. WTF? This is a Brad Bird movie. A man noted for cleanliness and sleekness of story. For trimming away the fat and leaving the core good stuff. How could this happen?

/looks at opening credits. Sees Story by Brad Bird and Damon Lindlehof. Ah! Good ole Damon. Master of bloat and confusion. All becomes clear. (For those not familiar with Lindlehof's abilities look at such masterworks as Prometheus, Star Trek Into Darkness, and Cowboys and Aliens. you've heard of a script Doctor? Damon appears to be a Script Dr. Kervorkian.)

It's a hot mess. It tantalized us with stunning shots of To orrowland then immediately pulls us away to spend agonizingly long times with cliched characters doing stupid things for completely incomprehensible reasons, just because!"

1654,5.0,"The Walking Dead is my favorite show. It's not just the walkers, it's the interaction between the characters and the many pieces of information The writers gather about all of them to form such interesting and and bitter back stories. I'm of course freaking out wondering who Negan hit with his scary bat."
1655,5.0,"Is it just me, or does this series just keep getting better ? Most series' hit a peak and then start fading away by now, but this series (season six) the situations and characters never stop evolving. The writers for this show should get a medal or something! And the quality of the camera work, the acting (which is great) the professional sound, the director is brilliant, and last but not least, HOW DO THEY MAKE THAT STUFF LOOK SO REAL!? If it's not CGI, then these guys have made an art of making all the zombie bashing look so real that I actually gasp out loud sometimes! YIKES! The action never stops. The gore is horrifying (but in a good way)...This series reminds me of other fantastic titles, like Justified, or Supernatural (and a select few others) they just keep drawing you in. Everyone I know watches this show. I was looking for something good to watch and my son said The Walking Dead is about the BEST series he's ever seen. Soooo, I started watching it from the first episode, and then I binged all the way to season four and paid for the 5th.... I. Was. Hooked. Bad! We're caught up (dang) and now were waiting for the next episode. And Glen better NOT be dead or I my wife will have a caniption fit!!
SPOILER:This review is for fans that are probably freaking out as bad as I am. Glen is alive! My wife is very happy; when Glen finally crawled out from beneath that dumpster she as punching me in the arm (ouch) and shouting: Ooo! Ooo! I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU !!! Honestly, I'd already heard rumors. I'd heard that fans were going to riot, and start a mutiny if Glen was gone. Okay....whew...good one that! But all of a sudden Rick and the ""family"" are running out of supplies. They're slowly starving, BUT THEN. Rick and Darrell meet a guy....Jesus. Yes, I said Jesus. A guy named Jesus. But this Jesus, (a regular guy) might turn out to be the answer for our desperate heroes? Turns out, not so much. Once again. The writers change gears near midseason.
UPDATE!!!
OMG!!! Did everybody see this ending?!?! WTH! I'm freaking out! Who just got their head.... oh, man!!! Nope...not gonna do it...I just can't potentially spoil this for somebody. But...OH MAN! Does this show freaking rock, or what!? (rhetorical question) The actors, the writers.. BRAVOOOO! (Lots of clapping)
CANNOT WAIT FOR NEXT SEASON"
1656,5.0,"Episode 9, Season 6 was freaking epic! I loved the opening scene. Those people keeping track of how many walkers are slain in each episode are going to have their hands full with this one.

Finale: I spent all season waiting to see which of my favorites they were going to freaking kill ... now I have to wait until next season. Worse, it may leak, and that would be more awful than not knowing. Is Carol going to become bad-ass again and kill mean ol' Negin for everyone? That would be ridiculous (sorry Carol)."

 This episode was great for bringing light to Morgan's recent past but who cares if he's a peaceful warrior. THIS A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE . There isn't room for REHABILITATING MURDERERS DUMMIE!!"
1658,4.0,"Max and his beautiful girlfriend Evelyn move in together. At first, it seems pretty awesome until she reveals herself to be controlling, overbearing, and manipulative. It starts out with small things like freaking out over an ice cream server talking to him and then escalates with removing any trace of him from their apartment (including his valuable horror movie posters), replacing it with hideous but environmentally friendly decor. Max has had it and prepares to break up with her, but she dies in a horrific bus accident before he has the chance. He's still sad of course, but is now free to date someone else perhaps with similar interests. Max randomly bumps into the ice cream shop girl who is clearly better suited for him and they hit it off. Unfortunately, Evelyn returns from the dead and expects to make him into a zombie so they can be happy together forever. How can he break up with her now when she's a zombie?

You might find this plot familiar as it is extremely similar to Life After Beth, which I watched last year. While many of the plot points are the same, I enjoyed this film's execution much better. The main character is better portrayed here. Max loves horror films and dreams of owning his own horror themed store. This is a great decision because it automatically makes most of the audience at least a little sympathetic to him because they share that love of horror. I still found him a little annoying. He wants to keep both girls in the dark while having the benefits of being with them both. Admittedly, the benefits of keeping Evelyn happy include living, but he ultimately doesn't want to be turned into a zombie to be with her forever. The emotional benefits to be with Olivia are better and he truly enjoys being with her. I guess if he actually had conviction from the beginning, there wouldn't have been much of a movie.

The plot is extremely basic and predictable, but what makes this film so much more enjoyable than others like it is the actors. Max is all right. He's the quintessential ""nice guy"" that actually isn't all that nice. He's indecisive, immature, and just not in charge of his life. He also lets everyone push him around and doesn't assert himself at all. It got on my nerves especially when two women are vying for his attention. Ashley Greene is delightfully annoying as Evelyn. I just can't help but enjoy how passionate she is about her issues and how manipulative she can be towards Max. While Aubrey Plaza let that opportunity slip by in Life After Beth, Ashley Greene delights in her role and makes it fun to watch. Alexandra Daddario as Olivia is just a ball of sunshine. She's a bit quirky, a little morbid, and seems like a fun person. I would totally frequent her ice cream shop with obscure influences, horror references, and fun flavors. Olivia and Evelyn contrast nicely with their respective passions and contrasting attitudes. The only character I didn't really like was Max's half brother Travis. He was simply a womanizing misogynist who didn't really add much to the movie.

Burying the Ex is a fun, but formulaic movie. It's a better film than Life After Beth, its carbon copy, only because of the actors infusing life into the pretty thin characters. The underlying theme is clear, but relevant. The ex-girlfriend is rotting because there isn't anything to be gained from that relationship any longer. They can choose to stay together, become undead, and be miserable together or they can move on and live happier lives. As a zombie romantic comedy, it's fine, but nothing special."
1659,3.0,"Very low budget, questionable acting, some really unbelievable scenes (seeing your brother with a demon face and not freaking out)  made it hard to not laugh but the ending was indeed creepy."
1660,2.0,"I was a teenager when the phantom menace first came to theatres. I only saw the film twice as opposed to dozens of times I had viewed the original trilogy. I though I had simply grown out of Star Wars and that's why I couldn't get into the prequels. A week ago, I watched the prequels for the first time since I viewed them in theatres. Wow, turns out it wasn't me just growing out of Star Wars, these are just really bad movies period with the phantom menace leading the awfulness. I wanted to like these films, I tried to like them but I just couldn't.

Phantom menace-Really, really bad. I don't know where to even start. The script is not well developed. Do we really need a movie to show councils meeting and sitting around the whole time? Nope. The trade disputes just should been left in the opening scroll. The cgi is terrible. There is one scene towards the end on Naboo showing tanks sitting on green hills. It's very brief but I swear in one shot, there are only three colors, green, khaki, and blue. Very little detail whatsoever. Characters are totally flat. I was really excited to learn of anakin's childhood. There isn't much  in the movie at all about him. He raced a pod, and was supposedly a great pilot even though auto pilot took him into the battle above Naboo? Jar jar f*cking binks. Incredibly annoying and totally fake looking.
Attack of the clones-Gag me. Christian whatever his name was so terrible in this movie!! I don't usually notice bad acting but it's impossible not to notice in this film. The love story is totally lame and not believable between him and padme. There's no ""I love you,"" ""i know,"" moments like with Han and leia. It's not interesting at all to watch. Again cgi was bad.
Revenge of the sith-Christian what's his nuts acting has much improved. Definitely a noticeable difference. Again the cgi sucks and totally detracts from the film. In fact, that all this film is really; cgi with some real actors thrown in looking exactly like, well they are standing in front of a green screen. No interaction with the environments at all. Way too many lightsaber battles too. They all looked really fake (big surprise). While I always wanted to see yoda in action, his cartoonish (again bad cgi) appearance with his ridiculous somersaults are so freaking cheesy. And what's with grievous having light sabers?
I don't consider myself a Star Wars fan boy, but I can definitely see why people prefer the original trilogy. The prequels are just mediocre films at best. Watching them was a chore."
1661,1.0,I can't believe that people are actually buying this.  These movies were a freaking travesty.  Even more so on blu ray.  Don't support Lucas!
1662,3.0,"I enjoyed this movie about as well as I thought I would.  We played a drinking game while watching it and every time the movie did something quite cliche/predictable, we took a shot.  Well, after several shots and only a half hour into the movie we decided to stop.  Overall, this isn't a bad movie but it's certainly forgettable.  If you're looking for an action movie and simply want to turn your brain off for a while, this is definitely a good choice in movies.  One bright point of the movie was the acting, I honestly didn't have a complaint there.  And it was relatively entertaining throughout the entire movie.

I think one of my main issues with the movie is the premise of the movie.  Its about rescue helicopter pilot trying to save his daughter.  At the beginning of a movie, he's freaking using a rescue helicopter as if its his.  So, with everything he did in this movie, it kind of left me wondering how many people died that he could have saved had he not been so focused on simply saving his daughter."
1663,4.0,"I liked the movie, an action story, drama, and to the detractors, what do you know?  Its' a story/movie Based on fact and imagination, maybe not to far from the truth.  What could happen.  Obviously when it happens, no helicopter pilot will save people with buildings collapsing.  Or take a boat from a dock with a 6 cylinder sounding like a V8.  It's a freaking, story!  Watch enjoy or shut up. It's a movie, too many critics.

I liked it. It's a Superman, Batman, or for you detractors, Cinderella.  It's fiction, meant for entertainment, while based on what could happen."
1664,1.0,"Great hype for this movie! Great action and graphics, but poor story line. Major plot holes that could easily have fixed with back story at the beginning like in every freaking Mad Max movie ever made. George Miller embarrassed and stained himself by producing this filth! Tom Hardy DID do a phenomenal job along with Charlize Theron. The British actor and Riley Keough did amazing as well. This movie was just terrible though because of lack of plot and holes in the story."
1665,1.0,"I was utterly disappointed in this movie. Man talk about running out of ideas and resorting to political correctness to cover the fact a great series was sold out to social engineering. I couldn't watch the whole thing. It was just too freaking artificial and repetitious; besides the other three Mad Max had the same stunts. Where was the insanity that is Max himself. Max is the heart and soul of Mad Max not some politically correct socially engineered BS.
The title is false advertising. I am surprised Hardy put up with the emasculation of Max. So, Hardy, I appreciated you as an actor but no more.
Miller was done years ago. Now he has tarnished his own legacy."
1666,4.0,"The movie was perfect in regards to the action, story line, & acting. What prevents it from getting the 5th star are a couple of things.
I really wish their was more back story to some of the characters like Imortan Joe.
The other is something that happens in every movie out there. Why is the dialog so freaking quiet it forces you to crank up the volume just to hear what is said, then your ear drums get blown out when there's music or an explosion?"
1667,4.0,"You want character motivations and script analysis, go elsewhere. This review's a little different.

Mad Max was never my cup of tea. Dont know what it is, but I never got into it. They were OK movies, I just never really cared. Why did I see the new one? It looked like it could be pretty good. And? Mad Max: Fury Road IS good.

No, its not Lawrence of Arabia, but it is a thoroughly good movie. Now, it has issues. Issues I have castigated movies for in the past. Whats the difference? Why does this movie get a pass? Ill tell you. And no, its not Because its a Mad Max movie. Thats lazy and stupid. A movie needs to be WORTH excusing the little problems beyond the genre or title. Thats what you call suspension of disbelief and it has little to do with its this kind of movie. It boils down to three VERY important items. So, rather than an in depth review full of insider nonsense about frame rates and character motivations, lets look at the three major reasons this movie works and so many others do not. And maybe afterwards Ill set a few angry anti-feminists straight on something.

1. Effort:
From everyone. Writing, directing, photography, stunts, costumeseveryone. One department fails, the movie as a whole can fail. See Stallones latest series of lazy cash-ins. If everyone works hard except for your main actor or the effects department, or the director, the whole movie starts to look and feel lazy and you totally lose your audience. I suppose this is why I cant stand most of the bad on purpose movies getting pumped out lately by the likes of The Asylum. The Asylum truly does not try. So many movies from them and from major studios are lazy on purpose and excused as a genre now. I can get more enjoyment out of Italian B-Flicks like Yor, or downright bad movies like Space Mutiny, than I ever will out of Sharknado. The reason is that the former actually tried and cared what they were doing in spite of their limitations, and The Asylum knowing makes garbage on purpose. That insults me as a viewer and its dangerous for movies as a whole.

It lowers the bar for movies as a whole when bad on purpose becomes more profitable than genuinely trying. Here George Miller made a bat-crap crazy movie that reads on the page like The Asylums wet dream, but theres a major difference, and no, its not budget. The original Mad Max cost a little less 400 thousand dollars to make in 1979. Adjusted for inflation thats around a million dollars, which was the budget for Sharknado. Meanwhile it is still objectively a better movie than Sharknado. You can enjoy either one, but one is obviously crafted with care and the other is obviously a product. So, whats the difference?

2. The desire to make a genuinely good movie:
I know its like kicking a crippled man at this point, butMichael Bay. Transformers had a budget of $150 million. Fury Road had a budget of $150 million. Both movies are huge action extravaganzas with minimalist plots and thin, surface level characters. Why is this movie better? George Miller actually cares what he churns out. Which goes back to effort. He cared more so he tried harder and so did everyone involved in this movie. I suppose there may be another factor, which brings us to

3: Talent:
George Miller is a talented director. He knows when to push, when to pull and when to leave well enough alone. He surrounds himself with talented people who work equally as hard and care about the finished project. He knows his material back to front and front to back and doesnt try to FORCE the audience to have a good time or feel something, he lets the material do it for him and he just films it.

And thats why this movie works.

A post Script on feminism in this movie, and the little boys who are angry about it.

Firstly, lets get something out of the way. If you're a feminist and you excuse a movie that is otherwise terrible because of the strong female characters? Thats about as stupid a reason to praise an otherwise bad movie as any Ive heard. Men, women, whatever. Good is good and crap is crap, and as much as Id like to see more strong female protagonists in Hollywood, I want them in GOOD movies. Luckily  this IS a good movie.

MEANWHILE, if you're a guy and you're pissed that there are so many tough ladies taking the focus off of Max and you're blaming feminism and Eve Ensler for corrupting your precious Max Max movie? Grow up and grow a set of balls that isn't threatened by a woman with a gun that doesnt need your help. Eve Ensler was there for one reason only; to advise George Miller and the actresses playing The Wives on the realities of sex slavery and human trafficking. Its the same reason military personnel were advising the War Boys. Expert consultation. Max isn't some perfect, impervious warrior. Sometimes he needs saving. Even the old movies made that perfectly clear. Having some ladies in there kicking tail and pulling his ugly butt out of the fire was Millers decision, plain and simple. And it was a good one. Want to know why?

This is the freaking apocalypse, man! Only the strong survive! If you expect to see ANY women after the apocalypse, you better get used to the idea of them being TOUGH. You think the only people who could ever hoist a rifle and throw a punch are dudes? Ive got a few female marines, MMA champs, and farmgirls who want word with you. And if you run you're just gonna die tired.

Time to grow up, boys."
1668,3.0,"I watched this a few time because the first pass I fell asleep.

First off - New Zealand is the most beautiful place on Earth and when you realise how little CGI was used on the landscape you will quit your job and move. Plus - seriously - The All Blacks!

So, Sherlock Holmes, I mean Smaug dies in like the first 10m (literally 10:42m) from a father/son bonding moment involving an specific arrow.  The town in in flames and most people scatter to shore.  Love-sick dwarf decides that girl from Lost, who is now a middle-class elf, is not worth it and leaves her on the shore. More on the 'Republican' sickness that is eating away at Thorin (lust for money and power). The girl from Lost is banished and Orlando-Dreamy-Bloom defies his father for love. Cate-Breathtaking-Blanchett, Queen of the Elves, can do no wrong and conquers evil and rescues Gandalf (oh Ian, how you make me swoon). Watson, I mean Bilbo, reveals he has the King's Jewel, conundrum abounds. Then we have like 10 hours of everyone trying to convince each other to work together to fight the REAL enemy and not each other (if only people could realise this). Long pauses of thought... hard decisions, overcome petty justifications to NOT help each other... blah. Over an hour in, the 'battle' actually starts. MASS amounts of CGI. The elves are quite shiny. Thorin is still being a hassle. Fight Fight Fight.

Oh wait, let's stop here, in the middle of a freaking battle, and catch up on each others lives. While arrows are flying all around us. Because this is logical. Why not some tea and biscuits?

at 1h 24m, Thorin realizes he's not a Republican and says sorry. Another 6 hours of fighting and CGI. Watson wants to fight. The girl from Lost goes against totally hot Lee Pace for the honour of the dwarf who left her on the shore 10 years ago. More fighting. blah.

Saddest moment in the film - Dwarf and Lost girl reunite, as he dies. This pissed me off. I mean come on... This is Romeo and Juliet stuff we have here. They love each other. They overcame centuries of animosity between the races to find love. The he dies. I call BS!

Half the cast dies. Then - seriously - Watson and Ian toke up like nothing happened and decide it's time to go home. really?

And the tie-in to The Lord of the Rings.

End Credits song - Billy Boyd - this man in amazing.

I love Tolkien. I love fantasy. I love how Peter Jackson brought these books to the screen - gathering up the original illustrators, Alan Lee and John Howe (such respect). The actors, locations, music... movies you can get lost in and believe all of this actually happened. Leaning that life is a struggle, and we befriend people along the way would have never thought we'd meet. We win and we lose, we find love and our heart are broken. People leave us while we find commonalities with those we never imagined.

but, these movies go on... and on... and then some. That said, I will still watch them over and over!!"
1669,5.0,"Enjoyed the three ""Lord of the Rings"" movies.  This is the BEST by far.  Peter Jackson is a freaking genius."
1670,5.0,"This movie is soooo freaking good, I will see it again, really think I will get all of them I really like the hobbit movie's was sad for me at the end, wished they were not ending them now, but well worth it all."
1671,5.0,"I've been watching anime for nearly 20 years now, and while I have plenty of favorites in different genres, ""The Future Diary"" is probably the all-around best one I've ever watched. It's heart-poundingly suspenseful, utterly creative, and operates on a sort of ""nightmare logic"" that draws you on like very little else out there.

The official product description is excellent, so I won't rehash that and will just jump into what makes this series so freaking good. Essentially, ""The Future Diary"" has two core story elements: the survival game and a twisted love story. The survival game element is similar to ""Battle Royale"" and ""Hunger Games"" in that a crew of strangers have been pitted against one another in a battle to the death -- this time by no less than the god of space and time. The human element in the story, Yuki's battle to maintain morality and decency in a Hobbesian ""kill everyone"" nightmare, will be familiar to fans of this setup, and this show pulls it off very well. Where ""Future Diary"" diverges from (and surpasses) those others is the eclectic weirdness of the contestants and the creativity of their weapons. Each contestant is given a ""future diary,"" a record of the immediate future that allows them to see attacks coming... but no two work the same. Yuki's tells everything except what affects him personally. Another diary displays a record of the activities of victims, and yet another only maps out escape routes. These diaries are wielded by a crew of deranged weirdos, mostly, but also by a few noble and decent people drawn into something awful. You will care deeply about the cast, and many of your long-term favorites will likely be people you least expect. Expect to cry like a baby when they get violently offed.

The second core element, the twisted love story, somehow manages to be one of the best romances in animation despite being deeply disturbing. Yuno loves Yuki to distraction, and at first he's flattered by this, but the more he learns about his would-be girlfriend, the more terrified he becomes of her. Yuno is worryingly good at killing people, and pretty-much unfazed by doing it. It soon becomes clear that this pink-haired cutie may be the scariest contestant of them all, and she can seldom be trusted to do the right thing. But this is literally a ""can't live with her, can't live without her"" situation, made all the more painful by the fact that there's genuine affection between this couple despite the deep distrust. Several massive plot twists occur that make the prospect of long-term happiness bleaker and bleaker, but the whole time, you, the viewer, start to subconsciously root for ""Yuki X Yuno"" to make it. And when it all wraps up, you... well, I won't spoil it. But reference the ""cry like a baby"" part above. Your heartstrings will be bent all out of shape, but it will be totally worth it.

I also wanted to give special props to the music, which is beautiful and always hits the right emotional notes for the scenes it accompanies. This release also contains both subtitled and English-dubbed vocal tracks, and the latter is really, really good. Though this is always a matter of debate, I feel the English voice actors surpassed their Japanese originals in almost every case here. The English voice actors and actresses for Yuki, Yuno, Minene, and Murmur deserve special props for quality.

This particular release (whole series on Blu-Ray) is well-worth buying if you haven't previously purchased the two DVD sets -- it's cheaper, and the Blu-Ray quality ensures higher-fidelity picture. If you do already have the DVDs, though, the motive for buying this new set is less clear. There have been zero new extras added to this new release, and it has no ""collector's-edition"" style bells and whistles. Most aggravatingly, it doesn't include the ""Future Diary: Redial"" OVA which has been out for several years in Japan but has never made it into a release in the English-language market. ""Redial"" does a great job explaining the abrupt and confusing last few seconds of the anime, so it would have been a wonderful inclusion to this set. Its continued absence from Funimation's release, even after the passage of several years, is sort of baffling and is perhaps the only let-down of this set.

All the same, if ""Future Diary"" isn't part of your collection yet, you owe it to yourself to pick it up, and this is the most affordable and high-quality way to do it. As a parting anecdote, this is one of the few anime I have always had success hooking non-anime-fans with once I explain the premise. A coworker who wouldn't be caught dead watching ""cartoons"" asked me for an update on the plot every day when I came to work while I was watching it. It's simply that good... CRAZY good!"
1672,5.0,"Guillermo del Toro has become one of cinema's true film magicians throughout his career, which started with a steampunk-sprinkled vampire yarn titled Cronos, and has seen films made about ghost stories, super heroes, and giant freaking cockroaches. It is with Pan's Labyrinth, however, that del Toro makes his name known to all. Simply put, this film is perfection, and a true dark fairy tale. It is a film that represents the innocence of a young child, a theme del Toro visited earlier in his 2001 ghost story The Devil's Backbone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Backbone-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00CEIOH3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Backbone (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]. This film is at times ultra-violent and appealing to the child in even the most cynical adult, yet also one of the most visually stimulating films ever made. It's basically Guillermo del Toro's mind poured out into a film canister.

I own the single-disc DVD version of the film, which contains a video prologue by the director as well as del Toro's feature-length audio commentary. It's in the original aspect ratio (1.85.1) and a very good and easy to understand English subtitle translation of the Spanish-language film. The picture is clear and crisp and really shows off the film's visual nature.

A great product representative of an equally great film!"
1673,3.0,"This movie will only appeal to slightly psychologically damaged, clever individuals capable of viewing, feeling and experiencing darkness without running for cover or pressing the stop button on the remote. Tony Soprano would love this film.

Visually sumptuous and exceedingly violent, this is a film which assumes the viewer has some knowledge of authentic fairy tales and ancient myths of the distant past where there are no generic and formulaic happy endings featuring (thank God), where Snow White dies as a result of eating the poisoned apple and where Sleeping Beauty never does awaken from her coma.

The extras on Disc 2 will help you understand the film on a deeper level  so if you are ignorant about such things, go ahead and watch Disc 2 first. That way you'll have a far greater appreciation for the film.

Regarding the horrific violence; it's not gratuitous and I loved it.  The aggression and sadism only added o the R-rated appeal of a fairy tale film, like Anne Rice's Beauty Series. Once again, this isn't a movie for dim witted artistically conservative viewers.

Reading the previous reviews, I noticed tons of idiots complaining about the subtitles...are you freaking kidding me? What's the matter with these idiots, can't they read English? If your biggest gripe about this movie is the subtitles then understand this- you're an idiot."
1674,5.0,"Since Mad Men every network has tried to do period pieces on network tv
CBS had Vegas (which was  awesome to bad nobody gave it a chance)
ABC had Pan Am, and The Astronaut Wives Club
NBC's first  attempt was The Playboy Club (so stupid and pointless)
WGN's Manhattan is freaking amazing in every way  (Check it out)
FOX never once even tried there to busy making old over played cartoons
NBC took a gamble and tried again with Aquarius
Is it worth of the hype? was NBC playing bait and switch or was it something special?
Without a doubt it's deserving of all the hype it got
While it's far from flawless and perfect there is a lot to appreciate and love about it
the detail with the wardrobe, hair, make-up cars, buildings, everything is amazing!
a few episode in you'll feel like you are in 1967  The director did a amazing job
the quality of this series is like a big budget film

The Cast is really good all around
David Duchovny gets to trade in his FBI character for a much better character in Detective  Sam Hodiak
(at first he's a jerk-off but, you have to realize '67 things were so much different you have a middle age man who no longer fits in a police department that's changing in leaps and bounds
Grey Damon  as  ""young"" plain clothes cop Brian Shafe  (great performance he represents all the changes that are coming in the future)
Claire Holt  as  Charmain Tully (the only female cop that wants to be a detective)
Chance Kelly  as  Detective Ed Cutler  (you might not know his name but, your know the actor)
Bran F. O'Byrne  as  Ken Karn  (great performance over all)
David Meunier  as  Roy Kovic (anyone who is a FX Justified fan will know him)
Emma Dumont  as  Emma Karn, (They set her up as the person you as the viewers should see the story through but, there are so many twist and turns
Michaela McManus  as Grace Karn
Jodi Harris  as  Opal ,
Spencer Garrett as  Hal Banyin,
Ambyr Childers  as  Sadie
Graham Beckel as  Lieutenant
Gethin Anthony  as  Charles Manson (This was a very odd casting choice he looks nothing like Manson he has the voice down but, psychically  it don't work) Gethin's version of Manson is the biggest problem with this show over all... Once you get use to him you're over look it but, it does take a lot away
NBC all did the right thing with all original licensed music AAA+++

It's also the most Adult series on there network
(lots of sexually content nothing hard but, NBC usually don't use sex in this way)
The less you know about it the better that might sound hack and lazy but, the story is very complex everything bleeds together
and there's plenty of cool payoffs.....

For anyone who loved american history growing up this is very interesting
The series itself has so much going for it there is a deep social commentary through-out the season
If you put a mirror against 1967 and 2015 have we really gotten better? have things changed for the better or worse?? we still are at war!
 This is a  very different and unique  period crime drama  9.2/10"
1675,1.0,This show is freaking awful!!!!!! It is not funny and not smart and well made. The humor is nothing but fart jokes and it is stupid as heck. The show is about a kid and a pet snake who live everyday lives. WOW the creators should take lessons from Disney's Teacher's Pet Teacher's Pet is the polar opposite from this trash. The humor is very funny and I laugh every time I see that show. Teachers pet is for the whole family instead of school drop outs with no good sense of humor which is Sanjay and Craig. Another thing about Sanjay and Craig are that the characters are annoying. They are not like-able at all but make you want to punch them in the face. A lot of the episodes are plain disturbing like the one where Sanjay gets pregnant to his fart. I am not kidding. WTH!!! Why is this on nickelodeon??? Back to Teacher's Pet. The show is very creative and have funny episodes instead of scaring ones. The characters are lovable especially Spot Helperman aka Scott Leadready. What show #2 Teacher's Pet and not loser and dweeb.
1676,5.0,"This is going to be a quick, easy, and painless review. Nothing too wordy, from a film lover who loves all the Star Wars films...

The best thing about this blu ray release is the sound! The sound will blow you away!!

You get 4 cinematic masterpieces (A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, and Revenge of the Sith)

The old trilogy looks great, even though there is a slight hint of grain whenever you see the sky. That must be the film stock though. A New Hope looks so good I gave away my limited edition theatrical version on DVD. Who gives a crap who shot who first, this HD is amazing!! Plus the Han/Greedo scene is improved and feels slightly more ruthless than the Special Edition on DVD.

I don't care about the changes. I like Vader saying ""No."" It makes sense because he has regained his humanity.

You get 2 fun and entertaining films (Phantom Menace, and Attack of the Clones)

Phantom Menace is the most improved film here, blowing the DVD transfer out the water and replacing the rubber looking Yoda with CGI Yoda, fixing continuity with the other prequels. I felt as if I was watching this film for the first time. Magical.

The bonus disc that covers the original trilogy is awesome.

However not all the deleted scenes have high replay value

one deleted scene from A New Hope is worth checking out and should have made the final cut, the Toshi Station scene. Great character development here!!!

one deleted scene from Empire Strikes Back is worth checking out and should have made the final cut, the scene showing Luke and Leia almost sharing a very deep and passionate kiss after he was rescued by Han. This scene would have made it a completely different movie!!!

Three deleted scenes from Return of the Jedi should have made the final cut, one showing Vader telepathically calling Luke as he creates his new light saber, the sand storm scene had good character development and shows Luke's wounded hand from rescuing Han, and a scene where Vader strangles an officer who says the Palpatine doesn't want to see anyone.

All the new overviews and interviews were great.

Bonus disc for Prequels is great too, EVEN THOUGH DELETED SCENES FROM DVD EDITION WERE NOT INCLUDED, SO HOLD ONTO YOUR BONUS DISCS!!!!!!!!!!!

New deleted scenes for Phantom Menace all sucked, completely worthless

Two new deleted scenes for Attack of the Clones were great, one dealing with Dooku's origin and another dealing with Anakin losing his memory of his mother. Should have been included in the final cut of film!!!!! Great character development!

One new deleted scene for Revenge of the Sith was great, dealing with Palaptine further seducing Anakin into the dark side. Should have been included in the final cut of film!!!!! Great character development!

All the new overviews and interviews for prequels were great.

Bonus disc with documentaries and spoofs was a mixed bag, especially if you own the awesome ""Empire of Dreams"" documentary from the dvd release. All the docs for the old trilogy didn't cover anything new that ""Empire of Dreams"" did and were boring. If you haven't seen Empire of Dreams you should, otherwise you might like these docs.

Spoofs was the best thing about this disc, freaking hilarious!!!

Star Wars Gadgets doc on technology was okay. i'd never watch it again.

documentary on the 501st was okay, i'd never watch it again

Empire strikes back 30 years later was the best Doc but not essential, it's hard to top Empire of Dreams in my eyes.

The only bad thing to this set is...

The case flat out SUCKS!! Don't like sliding my disc in and out of sleeves, even if blu rays are more scratch resistant, i don't care...

I used my old DVD cases and switched out the DVD's with the Blu rays. Feels more secure and guarantee to not get scratched!

So, this is a great set, just switch the cases with your dvd set and keep your bonus disc from the dvd's!!!

I wouldn't buy this set for the list price of $140.

Amazon price is okay, $80, but I got it for $70 used. If I were to put a value on it I'd say that's about right. 10 bucks each film and 5 for each bonus disc..."
1677,1.0,"Great hype for this movie! Great action and graphics, but poor story line. Major plot holes that could easily have fixed with back story at the beginning like in every freaking Mad Max movie ever made. George Miller embarrassed and stained himself by producing this filth! Tom Hardy DID do a phenomenal job along with Charlize Theron. The British actor and Riley Keough did amazing as well. This movie was just terrible though because of lack of plot and holes in the story."
1678,1.0,"I was utterly disappointed in this movie. Man talk about running out of ideas and resorting to political correctness to cover the fact a great series was sold out to social engineering. I couldn't watch the whole thing. It was just too freaking artificial and repetitious; besides the other three Mad Max had the same stunts. Where was the insanity that is Max himself. Max is the heart and soul of Mad Max not some politically correct socially engineered BS.
The title is false advertising. I am surprised Hardy put up with the emasculation of Max. So, Hardy, I appreciated you as an actor but no more.
Miller was done years ago. Now he has tarnished his own legacy."
1679,4.0,"The movie was perfect in regards to the action, story line, & acting. What prevents it from getting the 5th star are a couple of things.
I really wish their was more back story to some of the characters like Imortan Joe.
The other is something that happens in every movie out there. Why is the dialog so freaking quiet it forces you to crank up the volume just to hear what is said, then your ear drums get blown out when there's music or an explosion?"
1680,4.0,"You want character motivations and script analysis, go elsewhere. This review's a little different.

Mad Max was never my cup of tea. Dont know what it is, but I never got into it. They were OK movies, I just never really cared. Why did I see the new one? It looked like it could be pretty good. And? Mad Max: Fury Road IS good.

No, its not Lawrence of Arabia, but it is a thoroughly good movie. Now, it has issues. Issues I have castigated movies for in the past. Whats the difference? Why does this movie get a pass? Ill tell you. And no, its not Because its a Mad Max movie. Thats lazy and stupid. A movie needs to be WORTH excusing the little problems beyond the genre or title. Thats what you call suspension of disbelief and it has little to do with its this kind of movie. It boils down to three VERY important items. So, rather than an in depth review full of insider nonsense about frame rates and character motivations, lets look at the three major reasons this movie works and so many others do not. And maybe afterwards Ill set a few angry anti-feminists straight on something.

1. Effort:
From everyone. Writing, directing, photography, stunts, costumeseveryone. One department fails, the movie as a whole can fail. See Stallones latest series of lazy cash-ins. If everyone works hard except for your main actor or the effects department, or the director, the whole movie starts to look and feel lazy and you totally lose your audience. I suppose this is why I cant stand most of the bad on purpose movies getting pumped out lately by the likes of The Asylum. The Asylum truly does not try. So many movies from them and from major studios are lazy on purpose and excused as a genre now. I can get more enjoyment out of Italian B-Flicks like Yor, or downright bad movies like Space Mutiny, than I ever will out of Sharknado. The reason is that the former actually tried and cared what they were doing in spite of their limitations, and The Asylum knowing makes garbage on purpose. That insults me as a viewer and its dangerous for movies as a whole.

It lowers the bar for movies as a whole when bad on purpose becomes more profitable than genuinely trying. Here George Miller made a bat-crap crazy movie that reads on the page like The Asylums wet dream, but theres a major difference, and no, its not budget. The original Mad Max cost a little less 400 thousand dollars to make in 1979. Adjusted for inflation thats around a million dollars, which was the budget for Sharknado. Meanwhile it is still objectively a better movie than Sharknado. You can enjoy either one, but one is obviously crafted with care and the other is obviously a product. So, whats the difference?

2. The desire to make a genuinely good movie:
I know its like kicking a crippled man at this point, butMichael Bay. Transformers had a budget of $150 million. Fury Road had a budget of $150 million. Both movies are huge action extravaganzas with minimalist plots and thin, surface level characters. Why is this movie better? George Miller actually cares what he churns out. Which goes back to effort. He cared more so he tried harder and so did everyone involved in this movie. I suppose there may be another factor, which brings us to

3: Talent:
George Miller is a talented director. He knows when to push, when to pull and when to leave well enough alone. He surrounds himself with talented people who work equally as hard and care about the finished project. He knows his material back to front and front to back and doesnt try to FORCE the audience to have a good time or feel something, he lets the material do it for him and he just films it.

And thats why this movie works.

A post Script on feminism in this movie, and the little boys who are angry about it.

Firstly, lets get something out of the way. If you're a feminist and you excuse a movie that is otherwise terrible because of the strong female characters? Thats about as stupid a reason to praise an otherwise bad movie as any Ive heard. Men, women, whatever. Good is good and crap is crap, and as much as Id like to see more strong female protagonists in Hollywood, I want them in GOOD movies. Luckily  this IS a good movie.

MEANWHILE, if you're a guy and you're pissed that there are so many tough ladies taking the focus off of Max and you're blaming feminism and Eve Ensler for corrupting your precious Max Max movie? Grow up and grow a set of balls that isn't threatened by a woman with a gun that doesnt need your help. Eve Ensler was there for one reason only; to advise George Miller and the actresses playing The Wives on the realities of sex slavery and human trafficking. Its the same reason military personnel were advising the War Boys. Expert consultation. Max isn't some perfect, impervious warrior. Sometimes he needs saving. Even the old movies made that perfectly clear. Having some ladies in there kicking tail and pulling his ugly butt out of the fire was Millers decision, plain and simple. And it was a good one. Want to know why?

This is the freaking apocalypse, man! Only the strong survive! If you expect to see ANY women after the apocalypse, you better get used to the idea of them being TOUGH. You think the only people who could ever hoist a rifle and throw a punch are dudes? Ive got a few female marines, MMA champs, and farmgirls who want word with you. And if you run you're just gonna die tired.

Time to grow up, boys."
1681,5.0,"This movie was even better than I expected. I knew it would be funny but it's freaking hilarious. I LOVE this movie. Melissa McCarthy is so funny and just perfect in the role. Jason Statham was surprisingly funny as well. This movie is filled with comedy, action, and actually has an ending I didn't see coming which is rare for me. I highly recommend this film if you like comedy and/or action."
1682,4.0,"Not Golden Globe or Oscar material but it was definitely entertaining. Some of the acting was unrealistic; example some of the characters were way to calm when the crocodile and anaconda got close to them instead of freaking out like a normal person would do, otherwise good entertaining movie."
1683,5.0,I really can't say anything more about this movie other than what has already been said.  Just a freaking awesome movie!
1684,5.0,"...I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re-release of these three films on DVD. A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again. Now I don't blame them. I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor. I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again. Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score.

In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they make a great buy. I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again. The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me. They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better. The only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc, you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie--which is really not a big deal. I highly recommend getting these to those that don't own them yet."
1685,5.0,"Huge fan of all things Marvel, and Ant-Man was no different, well it is different. The pace of Ant-Man is more of a heist film than a normal Superhero film. Paul Rudd is brilliant. When dealing with Hank Pym, and his daughter, he is the comic relief. Around his crew, he is the smart and sane one. Michael Pena is just freaking hilarious. Totally enjoyable."
1686,4.0,"Uh..... it was okay. Not that it was predictable but it was.... well... predictable.  I liked it, but there wasn't enough future stuff and just a lot of blowing up and shooting up and shape-shifting metal dude who just won't freaking die... But, it's Arnold and the Terminator... what's not to like.  Just know that all the techy time travel space-time continueum talk will make your hair hurt."
1687,5.0,"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that the better you can eat, the better you will feel.
Of course, broccoli is better for you than donuts, but ... donuts!
But sometimes, we need to know WHY, instead of just being told to put something down.

I know a lot about nutrition and a lot about body processes. I am hypothyroid, and basically have had to learn everything I could medically to try to help myself, because doctors seem to blow off questions about thyroid function. I'm overweight, and have been told some of the most unbelievable whopper stories from doctors you would ever believe. I had one actually tell me that I just had ""elbow disease"", saying my elbow bent to my mouth too often. Um, no.  My tiny mother in law could eat more food than I could hold in two days and still stay tiny. There were obviously other factors in play here, but no one ever had any real answers - just the standard ""eat better"" and ""exercise more"".  I also went on a low fat diet for about six months, and gained steadily the entire time, despite eating sparse plates of food, things like yogurt and grapes for lunches, etc. My dr blamed me, saying I HAD to be eating more than that. I wasn't! But heaven forbid we look deeper than the surface! And when I told him that I didn't feel good when I ate fruit, I was told that was complete nonsense, and that I was making things up just to go off my ""diet"". To this day, fruit gives me a sugar rush that is very unpleasant!  I also don't like pies or cakes, but that's just me - I never liked them. But wave a cookie under my nose, and you have my attention!

I also made changes myself simply because there was zero logic behind some of the ""medical breakthroughs"", like not eating eggs and making an enemy out of butter. I just could not see how butter, made from all natural ingredients from a cow, could possibly be worse than the chemical cocktails whipped up, dyed yellow and sold as butter flavored margarine!  No freaking way. So, we ignored the medical release hype and ate real butter, eggs, meat (*gasp*), and did away with all low fat or diet drinks. Common sense tells you that if they remove the fat from a food, SOMETHING has to replace it so it doesn't fall apart or taste like cardboard. They DO replace the fat - with sugar!

This movie goes WAY below the surface, and gives you a real experience with the world of sugar. We've long known that too much sugar could be bad for you. But other than cavities, WHY avoid it when it tastes so good? (And yes - I know many don't think it tastes good - you are missing the point, so please spare the arguments about bad tasting sweet stuff.)

Damon walks us through the rapid and shocking changes our bodies experience when we give it the everyday diet of typical foods off the grocery store shelves. He doesn't eat candy, donuts or cake. He goes on a month long experience of eating what we normally put in our shopping carts under the guise of ""healthy"" food. Things like fruit juices, yogurts, health bars, chicken with teriyaki sauce, etc etc.

Now, I am very aware that many foods load it with sugar to make the chemicals palatable. We because serious label readers after my husband took a year of culinary classes at an area college. That's when we started to realize the lab experiments being sold as food that loaded our grocery shelves,
I was STUNNED by the amount of sugars hidden in our everyday foods on the shelf!  It changed the way we shopped, but we still were not feeling our best. Despite no longer buying some things like (dare I mention brands?) Hamburger Helper or Yoplait yogurt, which has so much sugar, you might as well have ice cream. We cooked more at home, choosing to control more of what we put into our bodies.

But we still didn't feel our best. There had to be more to this, and while I had been trying to do some of my own research as to WHY my body acted like I was the enemy, and preferred to pack on weight instead of releasing it.

Enter this movie.
Damon - THANK YOU!!
Seeing what is taking place in our livers was a real eye-opener. Yes, we hear about diabetes (either type), triglycerides, cholesterol, etc etc, but the medical community often wants to give you a pill to control the symptoms, instead of explaining what is truly happening and helping you to fix it. After all, medication is highly profitable!

I learned a LOT from this movie.  I have watched it twice, and will watch it several more times to get the information ingrained in my brain.
Damon is every personable and likeable, and the movie is well done - no yawn-worthy droning documentary-style fact recitation. He interacts with the viewers at every step in a very creative manner.

I cannot recommend this film highly enough. I am making everyone in our house watch it at LEAST once, if not more.
Our bodies are so adaptable to changes, and it was both a wow factor and encouraging how quickly things went downhill in his health, but also how quickly things went back to normal after returning to the sugar free foods he previously enjoyed.  Now, I don't enjoy Damon's metabolism and mobility, but there are certainly things that I can incorporate into my daily life to begin the reversal of what could truly be called sugar poisoning with being too far off!

Again - thank you Damon.
You did us all a great service!"
1688,4.0,Gravy is a fun horror comedy. It kept me entertained the entire time. I have to say James Roday impersonating Charlie Day the entire time was pretty freaking odd but I guess it added to the madness.
1689,5.0,Absolutely freaking terriffic!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE it!
1690,5.0,This was a super cute and funny movie.  My 8 year old nephews got a kick out of it.  The story line was great and I enjoyed all of the characters. Adam Sandler is a freaking ROCKSTAR!!
1691,1.0,"This movie did not justify the six, total six movies; to finally conclude this utter turd of a movie! I was really looking forward to this, and was kicked in my nuts when I reached the end. I am going to ruin it for everyone so they don't buy this crap. The ghost was supposed to be exorcised by the priest, and he failed. The little girl ends up walking through her effing wall in her bedroom, and ends up walking this mongoloid freaking hairy legged dude into the real world! Wow! What a climax... I could of told this whole story while taking a dump, and saved you all the misery of sitting through six movies. It should have ended with the first one. But greedy people have no more stories to make up when they think they have a cash cow."
1692,5.0,"People just cannot grasp anything beyond the obvious, which is part of the point of this movie.  The ending is not an obvious or expected conclusion, and that is just as it should be.  I won't reveal the actual ending, but some of this review is a spoiler, so don't read past this if you don't want to know parts of this movie in advance.

First, some say the actors were good, and you know, they were.  My biggest problem with the actors is three of them look like they just got out of high school and astronauts are trained experienced pilots and/or doctorates that have done considerable work in their field.  They don't test high school kids to see if they can handle a mission.  OK, not high school, but much too young.  The I broke up with my girlfriend, boo hoo thing, is just so freaking immature that it made me feel like I was watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  And the excess alcohol consumption statement and act is also not realistic.  Astronauts portray an image to the nation.  No astronaut would ever say publicly he just went on a four day bender.

So, I decided that I would try to look past that considering the actors are believable and did perform their tasks well.  No demerits for that.

The settings and special effects are all believable.  Many of these types of movies or tv shows fail because they have no idea how to present the scientific environment, showing people frantically typing or under ridiculous pressure to solve some computer problem, and this was more like real life in which there is reaction time, a thought process, decisions.  I liked that.  It did not once distract me from the film.

Without getting into too much detail about why two of the astronauts go missing and why the woman disappears and always comes back, the experiment overall makes sense, except for the ""Wayward Pines"" let's go see what is really happening out there scenes.  While these are key to explaining some of the behavior of the test subjects, the test itself makes no sense.

Here is the spoiler part big time, so stop here.

At the point at which they are trying to decide to exit the test chamber because they do not believe something outside is not wrong, it seemed to me at that point, they would have failed the test.  They exited the chamber before the 400 days was up.  End of story.

To then present what appears to be a staged world confronted by an apocolypse while they are underground is not a real world scenario because they would be in space, not on the ground, so they couldn't just take a walk around outside in the middle of the mission.  If it was a crash or emergency landing on another planet, the presented environment would not have at all been useful as a test environment, because that could not happen.  If the ship came back to earth successfully to have found earth destroyed and the people left behind rather demented, well, let's just say their survival or the ship would not be of much concern other than to ensure it did not fall into the hands of an enemy power.  It would not involve surviving an apocalyptic social event.

However, there are clues that this scene is imagined.  It is obvious that the three men are hallucinating at various points in the movie, and it is possible what they are presented is a stage and the people and things in it are just not real at all.  The two astronauts, for example, see their hallucinations and finally do recognize that they are disjoint from reality, and that is when they disappear.  We do not see those men die.  We are left to determine what happened.

The scenes in which the actual stabbings occur is left a bit to imagination as well.  Could that all have been staged or imagined?  One astronaut earlier had believed he was bleeding from his eyes, pores, mouth, etc. and then it all was just a dribble of blood from his nose after a scuffle.  So, Captain Kid may have just believed he was stabbed, but it did not seem that he was hurt as badly as that big knife would have accomplished in blood loss and pain.  The woman that stabs the Mad Max bad guy just before Captain Kid is stabbed to death does not let you see the wound and you are left to guess if that was all an act.  But when Captain Kid beats the other bad guy to death, that looked pretty real, and that would have been one hell of a hallucination or dream.

Still, if you take it at ""face value"" (pun intended if you get the part at which point the braun astronaut that stomps mice realizes that the woman behind him is from his porn magazines) it was a group hallucination, partially controlled, and perhaps it was left to the imagination of the subjects to form the environment, until it gets to the point they are drawn into their own worlds of fantasy and realize the entire thing is not real.  So, the apocolyptic world may not have been the planned hallucination, it just turned out that was something that the astronauts could grasp and the soil sample experiment done and the hallucination would have jibed with the data.  It was not a realistic scenario, but it would have tested the subject's abilities to grasp reality and to manage a highly stressful and even seemingly hopeless event.

Some believe the ending was ""lazy"".  It was planned and it started half an hour before the end of the movie.  The objective is to leave you in a similar state to the astronauts with whom you have shared the experience, and to leave you to conclude what was real and what was not.  What is certain about the end is, light comes in through the hatch, so the dust is gone.  And the outside world is still there, there is no apocolypse, and the experiment is complete.

So, you can overanalyze it, or just think about it a bit, or watch it a couple of times to ferret out the details, but the movie was well acted, it depicted what could happen in a strange experiment of this kind, and the ending was plausible if you believe that it all was an experiment.  What you cannot be absolutely certain of is why each part of the experiment was done as it was, but even the astronaut wannabes in the experiment don't know that.  They weren't likely to spend the last half hour of the movie explaining it.

The woman is obviously with the outside from the beginning and controlling the experiment."
1693,4.0,freaking hilarious
1694,5.0,"Greatest Western I have seen in quite sometime! This movie was so freaking awesome that my husband would like to write a review as follows:
I have never been a huge fan of the western genre. I liked Tombstone, Young Guns and that's pretty much it, but this movie was great! The actors dialogue was fun and clever. The middle meat of this film did a fantastic job developing the characters and making the audience root for them. If you have a queasy stomach or are easily put off by graphic violence, then this film is not for you. The gore was done in a way that truly complimented the story and made a horror nut love this film! If you are a fan of The Human Centipede, Hellraiser, Apocalypto, or gory films in general do yourself  a favor and rent this asap.
-Mike H."
1695,1.0,This movie would be ok  if it was written by a first time director and writer right out of film school. But by someone at this guy's level? And the kids with camera thing just went on too long and the big reveal was something cliche. And the 13-year-old white boy rapping songs about adult diapers!  I freaking kid you not! That alone should get the director's union card pulled.
1696,4.0,"After being very disappointed with ""Minding the Monsters,"" I was leery about buying Jeff Dunham's latest iteration of the continuing saga of a man and his, uh, dolls.  So I watched it on cable first, and while I didn't like this one as much as ""Spark of Insanity"" or ""Controlled Chaos"" (by far my favorite) what I saw is Jeff getting back to the comedy and character interaction that put him on the map in the first place.  Once again, Jeff finds a way to employ physical humor with his characters and it works.  While I agree with the reviewers who say he should have spent more time with Walter and Peanut, I actually thought the middle bit where he's doing a ""commercial"" for the Jeff Dunham ventriloquist dummy was freaking hilarious!  I also have to agree with those who say putting Achmed last doesn't work as well as finishing off with Peanut (and what ever happened to Jose Jalapeno on a stick?).  That's my biggest gripe about the show.  But again, what made this one worth it for me was seeing Jeff putting on a show that contained much more thought and effort than ""Minding the Monsters"" (which I think was largely an uninspired attempt by Jeff to make money off his fame while taking too many opportunities to bash his ex-wife).  Jeff gets back to his roots with this one.  If you're a Jeff Dunham fan, you'll want this one in your collection."
1697,5.0,Laugh so hard we cried. This move is light and so freaking funny.
1698,5.0,A freaking good film.
1699,1.0,"Here's the really short review: It's 2 hours of your life you'll never get back. Pretty much what they did was just repackage ""Transformers"" and release it again. So if you liked that mindless film . . . then you're a 3 year old on a sugar high and will watch anything with lots of flashing colors and loud noises.

In a nut shell, this is 2 hours of mindless CGI action sequences.  Then the ""acting"" bolts the computer generated sequences together. And that acting? Yeah, that was just dreadful. It was like scenes cut out of a daytime melodrama.

Were I watching this by myself, I would have turned it off half way through and found something else to do.

So here's how I made it to the end of this train-wreck:  Before watching it, my friends and I got on you-tube and found the video of Christian Bale freaking out on Peter Griffin from family guy. The whole way through the movie we were blurting out lines from that sketch.  ""Do you want me to rip your [...] lights down?!?"" response: ""Those are Christmas lights; I put them up so everyone would be happy.""

So we'd all start laughing and try to forget how terrible this flick was."
1700,5.0,"I wasn't that interested in going to the movie as I'm not a Dirty Harry fan or anything, but what a great movie. If you are offended by racial jokes - do not watch, but me and my husband found it freaking hilarious. Great story, very captivating, and a tear jerker. A definite must own."
1701,1.0,"WTF ? Huh ? There is never any indication that a story is unfolding. Other than the skull hatcheting piece by bloody bandage head guy and the arm sawing through the jailhouse bars scene, there's little to discuss or keep you interested except maybe well-hung blu guy Dr. Manhatten driving girl to glowing blue extacy. A freaking, jigsawing, nightmare. Intended strictly for comic book advocates who enjoy speed viewing tales of their super heroes."
1702,5.0,"Talk about a pleasant surprise when I wasn't really expecting much.

I'll try to say a thing or two no one's said yet and keep it brief. The OVAs, and actually each episode, seem to get progressively better as you watch them in order, and actually I thought the best part, by far, bar-none-no-contest-wow-that-was-really-freaking-well-presented, was the last part of the final episode. The way the ending is presented is *awesome*. Seriously, the way they play with the visuals and the audio to present that *very last shot* is *SO GOOD*. Just, dude, wow. What a WHAM of an ending they made that. It's so good, it makes every part previous to it just not even close. Watch it at night with good stereo cans on a big set, it's worth it, I'm serious.

The Corpse Party games were always very praiseworthy for their audio bits that complemented the on-screen stuff so well, and that translates to the anime incredibly well. They recommend at the beginning of the games to play with headphones for the full experience, and they're right. They honestly should say the same thing for these four episodes, because the same applies.

I noticed a few people mentioning fan-service being out-of-place here. Well, I can't argue the placement of it wasn't a little strange (like, right before they die, we get an underskirt cam?), but I can only specifically remember two instances of it, and they were brief enough it wasn't too bad. YMMV, but it didn't bother me too much.

Gore-wise, oh, yeah, you get that. No screwing around here, if you like your squick, here's your squick, with all the squish-squash sound effects of ""ick that's actually rather horrifying"" you could ever want. If you ever wanted to see the events of Heavenly Host happen in an anime without them ruining it, they do that, for sure. No pretense here, they know their audience.

Now, it might be worth mentioning some of the translation is different in important areas than the original games. For instance, what's called ""Heavenly Host Elementary"" is ""Tenjin Elementary"". ""Sachiko-Ever-After"" is changed to ""Happy Sachiko"". It's not that these are inaccurate, of course, just different localizations, but it's noticeable.

As a side note, I kinda liked the way the principal was portrayed in the few parts he showed up.

Anyway, for real, this is a surprisingly well-made little companion to the Corpse Party original game. Normally I'd consider it a drag that there's no dub, but the games never got that treatment, either, and it wouldn't be wise to watch this without having played any of the games. After three games in the series total, I've become very used to the original voices by now, even if I just prefer dubs the vast majority of the time.

Now, as you should know, this is a brief Blu-ray. It's four episodes. That's it. Which in a way is very sad, because the quality of them (and the transition to Blu-ray...Nice colors, I can dig it) is truly excellent.

Being a horror movie buff, I thought I'd seen everything at this point, but Corpse Party always had that certain style to it that made it stand out. At the extremes of horror films, you've got A Serbian Film and I Spit On Your Grave for sexual-violence horror, The Descent (original version, not the American theatrical one) for psychological horror, High Tension for bloody spree-killing horror, The Thing, The Hills Have Eyes, and Alien for monster horror, The Last House On the Left (original Craven version) for slice-of-life horror, and then...Corpse Party for ghastly, youth-focused, supernatural violence, which I just can't put in a category, but definitely has its own flavor unlike anything else.

That last part is worth some credit, really. Nothing really has the same flavor as Corpse Party ever has."
1703,2.0,"WARNING:  THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

Hannibal Season 1 was successful in establishing the back-story of the life of Dr. Hannibal Lecter as an adult before he was incarcerated; breathing life to the characters in law enforcement, academia, and the media who are trying to find the Chesapeake Ripper (some for very personal reasons); developing these characters so we grow to love them  or love to hate them; and showing us how the gifted but tortured Will Graham is manipulated by Dr. Lecter, culminating in a final episode that sees Graham institutionalized and accused of four murders actually committed by Dr. Lecter.

Season 2 was successful in showing us how Will Graham took control of his seemingly out-of-control predicament, evolving the co-dependent relationship between Dr. Lecter and Graham, breaking our hearts by killing off FBI Special Agent Beverly Katz, showing Dr. Lecter and Dr. Bloom becoming romantically involved (and Dr. Blooms struggle to determine who Dr. Lecter really is), introducing us to the manifestation of pure cruelty that is Mason Verger, and knitting a complicated web of intrigue leading up to the final episode that showcases betrayal, brutality, and a shocking revelation or two.

In the case of both seasons, all the stories were well-written and well-executed.  Even the sidebar episodes that show the day-to-day work of the FBI Behavioral Science Unit dealing with killers other than the Chesapeake Ripper/Hannibal were compelling.  So I had high hopes going into the third season that this one was going to be the best yet.  The producers intimated that Season 3 was going to dig into Hannibals past and further develop the relationship between Dr. Lecter and Dr. Du Maurier.  There was even a rumor that David Bowie might make an appearance as Dr. Lecters Uncle Robertas.  And, of course, the cliffhanger final episode of Season 2 left us with so many questions:  Who survived the bloodbath at Dr. Lecters home?  What was Dr. Du Maurier doing on the plane with the now-fugitive Dr. Lecter?  How much of the chronicles of Dr. Lecter as written by Thomas Harris would be addressed in Season 3?

So I watchedand oh boy, was I disappointed.

Instead of seeing more of what impressed me in the first two seasons, I saw a disjointed attempt to cram much of what happened in Red Dragon and Hannibal (the movie that came after The Silence of the Lambs) into one season.  But beyond that, the series devolved into a hot mess that was often very confusing  even for someone who has read all the Thomas Harris books and has seen all the Hannibal Lecter movies.  The stories didn't make sense, the actions of the characters made even less sense, and much of what happened was so farfetched that it ventured into the ridiculous.

To give you an idea of how Season 3 didn't work, lets take a look from the perspective of some of the characters:

ABIGAIL HOBBS:  She appears again in Season 3, and were actually teased into believing she survived.  Unfortunately, we find out later that she didn't make it and now only lives in the mind of Will Graham.  She would have been one of the success stories of Season 3 were it not for an episode that explores what happened from the time she was supposedly killed by Dr. Lecter in her family home up to the time of the major conflict in the last episode of Season 2.  We see Abigail basically going along with Dr. Lecters schemes without any context to indicate why she was a participant  or whether she was a willing participant.  She seems cold and distant in one scene, then she appears clearly disturbed the next.  Was she motivated by fear?  Did her survival instinct kick in?  Did Dr. Lecter sheep-dip her to such a degree that she became his automaton?  We don't know because were not told or shown, and the story suffers for it.

ALANA BLOOM:  Dr. Bloom miraculously survived being pushed out a second-floor window by Abigail without any permanent injury, but she makes the statement I got a lot of bone marrow in my blood, so my doctors say I may start thinking differently early on in the season.  This sets the stage for Dr. Bloom to (a) conspire with Mason Verger to catch Dr. Lecter  knowing full well Mason intends to torture and kill Dr. Lecter, (b) become a lesbian, (c) have a seizure-inducing kaleidoscopic lesbian tryst with Margot Verger, (d) become the surrogate mother for Mason Vergers baby, thereby becoming heir apparent to the Verger fortune, and  most outrageously of all (e) later trust Dr. Lecter to free Will Graham when the two are captured and held at Vergers Muskrat Farm.  Come onreally?  What doesnt fly is the dispassionate way she handles her betrayal by Dr. Lecter, especially after she comes to him later and asks him to rescue Graham.  It was largely her fault that Graham ended up in the hands of Mason Verger, and now she turns to the man who betrayed her and pulled the wool over her eyes for so long for help?!?!!  Sorry; none of what happened with Dr. Bloom is credible.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER:  Just as I was thinking the one person who knew Hannibal and what he was capable of better than anyone else had something up her sleeveWe learn that she finds Dr. Lecter in her house, cleaning up after leaving Abigail, Alana, Jack and Will for dead, and she decides to confront him  with a loaded gun.  Instead of destroying the monster once and for all or calling the police, she ends up going to Europe with him for reasons that are not clear by any stretch of the imagination.  She appears to give clues to those who are looking for Dr. Lecter, such as sitting on a bench in a train station in full view of the security cameras and making the same purchase of Batard-Montrachet and tartuffi bianchi (white truffles) from the same place the same day every week.  She also tells Hannibal repeatedly they're coming for him (DUH!), he will be caught (she should know better), and that she has some type of exit strategy planned so shell come out clean.  What was her great exit strategy, you ask?  She brought along her own little stash of psychotropic drugs and then told the Questura di Firenze that she was drugged and manipulated by her husband into believing she was someone else.  Jack Crawford didn't buy it, Will Graham didn't buy it, and neither did I.  That was the best that a seasoned psychiatrist with first-hand knowledge of the real Hannibal Lecter could come up with?!?!!  What the hell possessed her to go trotting off with him in the first place?  She had no reason to go  she could have simply turned around and left when she found Hannibal in her home.  To make matters worse, we find out the patient that was referred to her by Dr. Lecter really did die because he swallowed his tongue, so the whole mystique about Dr. Du Maurier somehow killing this patient ends up being a lot of smoke and mirrors.  MAJOR opportunity missed here as well.

CHIYOH:  Chiyoh is established as a woman who, as a girl, grew up as the attendant of Dr. Lecters aunt, the Lady Murasaki.  She is found at the Lecter Estate in Lithuania, guarding a man who allegedly murdered Dr. Lecters sister Mischa.  Chiyoh herself is imprisoned there with this man because she refused to kill him, so Hannibal left her there to keep him alive  and locked up.  She states that she is opposed to taking the life of a human being; however, after she is forced to kill Mischas alleged murderer when he attacks her, she departs the estate and engages in at least two acts of violence that could easily bring about death.  On one hand, she tells Dr. Du Maurier that she wants to see Hannibal caged, but she later implies to Hannibal she does not want him to have his freedom taken away.  Her presence in the story is one confusing contradiction after another.  The writers should have left her out of the story altogether.

FRANCIS DOLARHYDE (A.K.A. THE RED DRAGON):  I feel badly for Richard Armitage because he never got a chance.  Hes an exceptional actor, and he did what he could with this character  did it very well, in fact.  The problem is he was given so little to work with.  His part in the story was so condensed that it felt like watching the movie Red Dragon on fast-forward.  All we know about this guy is that hes got some psychological issues that motivate him to kill so he can become the Red Dragon.  They didn't dig anywhere near deeply enough into his past and what drove him.

FREDDIE LOUNDS:  Once again, Lara Jean Chorostecki portrays the obnoxious, ends-justify-the-means tabloid reporter to a T.  The problem is we see so little of her in Season 3, just as we started to get the sense toward the end of Season 2 that she was a lot more perceptive than we thought and that she actually has a heart.  The other downside here is we never find out how she was resurrected after a violent death was staged for her in Season 2.  A ten-second explanation would have sufficed.  We get nothing.

FREDERICK CHILTON:  Yes, we find out Dr. Chilton wasn't killed.  We learn that the bullet fired by FBI Agent Miriam Lass missed his brain by millimeters and that he is considerably disfigured as a result (we even get to see the nature and extent of the damage).  Raul Esparza also portrays the sniveling, self-serving, Uber-psychiatrist-wanna-be to a T, and as usual, he is thwarted at every turn.  But again, the writers ruined it by doing a cut-and-paste of what happened to Freddie Lounds in the book Red Dragon and applying it to Chilton.  Talk about taking the easy way out

HANNIBAL LECTER:  The mad monster was the biggest disappointment of all; and again, I have to say I feel badly for Mads Mikkelsen, who has done such a masterful job of putting his own decidedly creepy, twisted spin on Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  We begin the season NOT seeing him doing what he does best  killing a husband and wife so he can assume the husbands identity.  Not seeing all the murders actually works well because it becomes so much more shocking when you see Hannibal commit a spur-of-the-moment murder (as you will later on in the season).  We see more of his Chesapeake Ripper-esque handiwork later, we see him taking what appear to be unnecessary risks in terms of doing away with the wrong people, and it starts to venture into the unbelievable until you realize Hannibal is doing what hes doing to draw the hunters to him.  So why am I coming down so hard on Hannibal, you ask?  The answer is simple:  After escaping his home in Baltimore and getting to Europe, after committing numerous atrocities that weve come to expect from the worlds most well-known serial killer and not leaving so much as a scrap of evidence, after escaping from Muskrat Farm and a certain long, painful death, his days of freedom finally come to an end because HE TURNS HIMSELF IN!!!  Are you freaking kidding me?!?!!  The one man who is best-equipped to run and never get caught seeks out his hunters, throws his hands in the air and simply gives up?!??!!??!?!?!?!?  We don't want to see the villain surrender, we want to see him CAUGHT!!!  We want to see the ingenuity of the FBI and experience the tension of executing a meticulously formulated plan to take him down; never knowing if they can pull it off.  Yes, we are told repeatedly that Hannibal surrendered so Jack Crawford and Will Graham would always know where he is.  It just doesnt wash.  There is no way Dr. Hannibal Lecter would so lightly give up his freedom, knowing he would be deprived of his tastes and subjected to indignity.  The capture of Hannibal the Cannibal was the ultimate anti-climax.  It never should have been allowed to happen that way.

The end of Season 3 was so laughably predictable its sad.  They decide they need Hannibal to capture the Red Dragon so they stage Hannibals escape, which, of course, goes so dismally wrong  does anyone really believe Francis Dolarhyde could have found out the details about Hannibals release into Federal custody and then singlehandedly take out the FBI guards surrounding Lecter?  This leads to a final scene where Hannibal and Will go into the final conflict with Dolarhyde, destroy the Dragon, and plummet off a cliff together to almost certain death in the Atlantic.  The final scene shows a pressed-and-dressed Dr. DuMaurier sitting at a dining table with what appears to be a sumptuous roasted leg on beautiful display, and then we see that one of her legs has been amputated.  No sign of Hannibal though, but that older-than-Hollywood teaser leaves the door open for the series to be continued.  Well, after enduring all the confusion, contradictions, omissions about Hannibals past and all the simply implausible events in Season 3, Im glad to hear that NBC didn't renew and both Amazon and Netflix passed on this story that took 2 seasons to build and only 1 season to completely destroy.

The writing may have been on the wall after the first two seasons posted dismal ratings.  The principal characters all signed three-year contracts, and there must have been a palpable sense that NBC was not going to renew Hannibal for a fourth season.  This may go a long way to explain why Season 3 simply did not have the cohesiveness, the energy, and the dark magic that made the first two seasons work.  To their credit, the actors performances were still spot-on, and the music and cinematography (overblown symbolism and camera tricks notwithstanding) were still first-rate.  It just seemed as though the producers knew the series was coming to an end and they tried to wrap everything up; knowing they were biting off more than they could chew and not really caring.  They could have done so much more with Season 3.  Instead, we get a total cluster f**k.  Shame on you, Di Laurentiis Productions!  This is the third time youve tried to tell the story of the Red Dragon, and you haven't gotten it right yet.  Do us all a favor and hang it up."
1704,2.0,"Holy crap, that was one bad freaking movie. Bad acting, bad special effects, crappy camera work, horrible and unlikable characters. I mean, the list just goes on and on. It is really one of the worst horror movies I have seen in years. I fell asleep multiple times while watching it, and even when I was awake, I just didn't care enough about anyone involved to invest much in their outcomes. They were a$$holes in high school, and deserved everything they had coming to them. What else needs to be said about this movie? The only saving grace is the gratuitous booty shown in the first 10 minutes. That is one fine posterior. Two stars for that alone. The rest? Don't even consider it."
1705,5.0,This movie was fantastic! After about 20 minutes it becomes the graphic novel almost word for word. And it's really something special hearing conroy and hamil delivering those lines it brought a tear to my eye. So everyone seems to hate the beginning the Batgirl portion of the movie. In my opinion it's really good I liked it allot.  Now slight spoilers ahead. The sex scene that everyone is freaking out about isn't that big of a deal it's being way overblown. It's about 10 seconds of kissing and taking a shirt off. Now I did think that batman and batgirl being involved like that was weird. I do prefer Batgirl and nightwing. But it's not a big deal. Don't let something like that ruin your enjoyment of the movie. And don't let all of these negative reviews keep you from buying and seeing this masterpiece.
1706,5.0,"Exceptional acting from Sarah Silverman. This movie really got to me. It's such an open honest portrayal of how it feels when you can't be your honest self with your family because truthfully they don't love your honest self, they only care about the pretend self.

Heartbreaking scenes with the father that I can SO TOTALLY relate to.
The basic question,
""Why didn't you call me?""
And she takes him to the mat,
""No. I mean the Thirty years before that.""
Yeah. It's hard and painful just like that.
And in rehab she tries to talk openly with her husband and he freaking shuts her down by calling the kids over. BAM. We're done. Reality time is over. Time and time again she tries to open up to him. And what does he do? He shuts her down. He doesn't want a wife, he wants a wind up Barbie doll who doesn't complain.

I think, the families of addicts need to watch this movie. They are the ones who won't relate. I felt so badly for the way this movie ended. I desperately wanted Sarah's character to just be loved back. She loved them all so much. Sometimes all a person needs is some real honest love.

Again the blame is always that ""they""-the addict--are the problem, ""they"" need to get the help. It couldn't possibly be the effed up environment and dysfunctional dynamics surrounding them?

 That Donny was a real treat. Such a piece of crap. I hope Sarah gets the Oscar for this. She put herself through a lot to make this movie a stunning piece of lasting film. Timeless and real to the core. Brave On You, Sarah!"
1707,5.0,"Sarah Silverman? Really! She was pretty freaking good. It's a different kind of flick but I was really impressed by her acting skills. Good storyline...a little ""F@Cked"" up at times....but overall a good movie"
1708,3.0,"The acting is great. The set is awesome. The ghosts are freaking creepy as is that house. But something was missing. There was shock and horror, but there was little connection between the characters. I think the directing was too fast, the actors weren't allowed to find the heart of their characters. And I get that the music was supposed to be some kind of throw back to Gothic drama, but it really overpowered everything else with it's over-the-top cheesiness. Also, I was thrown when the male lead gave Mr. Rochester's speech from Jane Eyre. Was it supposed to be clever, to say that speech to the actress who played Jane Eyre? It completely distracted me from what was happening in the scene. Although, it occurs to me now that might have been deliberate, to highlight how phony he was.. OK, that is kind of clever.

Overall, I think the female lead was poorly written. The actress gave it her best, and she is very good, but she had too little to work with. She seldom reacted to things like a real person would. Coughing up blood? Huh. Weird wells full of blood-colored goop in the basement, with metal covers locked over them? The English and their peculiar ways. And though the house if fun, it goes beyond realistic. Especially her reaction to it. Which was basically no reaction. A hole in the roof? Blood colored stains on all the walls, rotting and dilapidated objects all over the place? For a woman of her up-bringing? Whatever. It's fine. Look, a dog!

I believe this movie is a victim of the current poor writing trend. Apparently Hollywood is spending all of it's money on actors and special effects, and there is no money left over to hire a decent script writer. At least it's not a remake."
1709,3.0,"It had way to much of the f word which added nothing except for filler dialogue.  They could have used actual dialogue instead and so added to the explanation of just what the heck was going on.  Pretty much is was a bunch of guys freaking out the entire movie over this deal they wanted to do to short the sub-prime housing market.  I had no sympathy for any of them because it was all about their greed vs the greed of the bankers.  I'd like to see a movie that explains the 2008-2009 crash that actually has some characters that most of us can relate to, ie non- Wall Street types who were affected by the mess.  The movie was short on explanation and long on cursing. Typical of Wall Street but not interesting or informative.  I rented this movie because I'm very heavy into exploring the economy and the markets, though I am not a player as it is completely rigged and anybody not on the inside is going to get hosed because of high frequency trading the fact that information is released to the inside way before the outside and it takes a lot of money to be privy to such info.  I watched this movie by myself because I knew the language would be filthy, which it was and I didn't want to put anybody else through it.  I thought of buying the book but there is really no reason to.  BTW, another economic crash is coming that will completely dwarf the last one.  This is because nothing was fixed and Wall Street and the revolving door of Washington/Wall Street appointments has grown a lot worse.  Politicians are completely dependent on Wall Street to keep them in campaign money and the ones who aren't bought don't last long.  Everything they say they've fixed is simply smoke and mirrors.  The reason they are all hiding their money in offshore accounts is because of the deluge coming very soon.  Believe nothing they say, watch what they do and then you'll know the truth. Hope this review has helped some."
1710,3.0,"It was an okay movie but , like someone else said slow and boring ,and I don't think most people will freak out that fast , only a week and people are freaking ,no I don't think so , also I think people in small communities like that one will band together and with more guns ,(If Hillary doesn't become president ) and help protect one another , anyway its an ok film !!!!"
1711,5.0,freaking awesome campy gore fest
1712,5.0,Come on. It's freaking ash vs Evil Dead. Watch it.
1713,1.0,I hate this movie. It shows a really sad relationship between mother and daughter. But take that hard to watch crap and add a freaking corny syfy monster. Ughh.... just awful. But I'm sure they spent a lot of money on it. Its excellent quality with excellent acting. But It just feels awful.
1714,5.0,"Ooooooooh wow!!! I'm doing this review right NOW. Just minutes after watching this perfectly acted screamer. The actresses MADE this movie. SOMETHING extraordinary HAPPENS IN THIS VID...As the movie plays out, you begin to realize how good Miss Kazan, and Miss Ballentine's performances really are! A lonely stretch of dark forest road is the set. Turn on the  rain (a downpour that lasts through most of the movie) It's pitch black (THE LIGHTING AND CAMERA SHOTS MADE you start getting spooked, and totally hooked right off the bat. The scenes,. filmed in the headlights of other vehicles...contrasted with the absolutely Black-hole of darkness, just a few feet past the forest edge...These things make THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IT BEING A CORNY SLASHER, AND BEING...WELL...FREAKING GOOD!

SUMMARY. NO SPOILERS:

The dark. The shimmery wet road...ceepy woods, the fog and rain...and two young ladies are in for a terrible ordeal. Those two REALLY KNOW HOW TO ACT ! I'm serious!, heck they had me scared waiting for this scary as HELL, creepy MONSTER WITH TEETH LIKE JAWS, to snatch the next victim. You don't ever get a really good look at this thing. The camera work made that shadowy beast, with all those teeth, look freaking spooky, Scooby doo! It's.probably a big suit,..made of neoprene, slime and rubber. A moulded creature suit)...whatever it was, it kept scaring the hell out of me! Jumping and snatching. You know, one of those.......waaaaait foooooor it....(Then)...BOOO!!! Heartattack!

Simple. Dark road, a wreck, the car is now just a hunk of scrap metal. ....rain.....BOO!!!  LOVED IT"
1715,2.0,"I gave this torturous movie one extra star because I like the actors and have seen them in other movies, especially the female lead who had appeared in Western movies.  I kept screaming in my head ""let's go, let's go"" but the movie kept slothing on: there's hardly any close ups shots; you can't see the expressions on actors' faces to see their emotions; 90% of all the shots are excruciating dragged out boring sloth moments; you are constantly waiting forever to move on to the next scene--""PLEASE MOVE ON.""  What's the meaning of this scene from the previous and how does this moment connect to the next!!!  Whatever good parts are dulled by the torture of the dragged out too freaking long ""wait, wait, wait"" for the next movement, words.  Every scenes is lethargically long (even the one huge dance scene (1:19 hr in) had no life in it), and the fighting scenes are split second flashes, comparatively.  I don't know how famous this director is but I am not watching anymore of his movies--this one killed all of his for me.  If you want entertainment don't bother with this movie, unless you want to torture someone's senses.  This director directs in an amateur level; emotions, messages, ideas, meanings, expressions--nothing came across--it is THE worst movie I've seen.  Sorry to the good actors who wasted their time doing this crap."
1716,1.0,"Unbelievable!  People that like this film must live in an alternate reality.  Some of the worst acting, writing, sound you will EVER see.  4 stars?  Bloody hell--this is why the Amazon rating system is so undependable.  Or perhaps its just the internet that gives everyone a say, no matter how freaking nutty.

Note to Amazon:  all those ""top reviewers"" who really like this film?--how on earth do you rate them ""top reviewers""?  They are polluting your ratings system (at least in regards to films)."
1717,5.0,"This is a freaking awesome movie! Sweet, funny, perfectly acted and directed, and heart warming."
1718,2.0,It was OK.  The ending got kinda goofy w/ crazy impossible human feats occurring which just became silly.  The story was OK - nothing great.  And where were his freaking parents??  I liked Innerstellar much better.  I would not recommend this movie.
1719,4.0,"I saw this about five times and its good.  Believable, like your on mars dude, and nobody is going to help you.  Stranded yes so instead of freaking out. he worked it out.  very good. well done.... I liked it............"
1720,5.0,"I just freaking love this. Go 3-D!
The director's commentary could have been better, but I'm happy that Mr. Abrams gave us something.
If you're not into 3-D or commentaries, save your $$$ and stick with the regular blu-ray disc."
1721,3.0,"I had been waiting for this movie to come out for almost a year.  My wife and I live in rural America, and had to wait for it to come out on DVD.  Let me first say that the animation was, to me, mostly spectacular.  The way that the rooms were constructed, the way the clothes folded in all the right places, down to the freaking pattern on her underwear! were all spectacular.  The little details really sold the show.

The story is where I was lost.  It centers around an author (Michael Stone) who has written a book about customer service and is town to give a speech about it.  We learn that he is not happy with his home life, and that he is appearing to do well mentally.  The movie focuses on a, what seems, 24 hour period, so there are a lot of background details that are left out.  These are filled in peripherally, but as a viewer we're still left hanging on some details.

It seems as if Michael's life has turned to s***, at the least it's become monotonous and boring.  After a time, though, we start to see that maybe there's something wrong with Michael mentally.  His night in town is not going well until he meets two of his fans.  They end up going out for drinks and then he hooks up with one.  Even she isn't enough for him, though, and ultimately he ends up going back to his old life.

I found this movie to be depressing, which is alright because sometimes life is depressing.  However, there was nothing to root for here, which made it difficult to continue watching.  All-in-all, I was pretty disappointed in this movie.  Maybe it would be different if I hadn't waited for 6 months to see it, but it's one that I'm glad I didn't buy."
1722,5.0,Holy cow!  Where was our support?  If you call...we come!!!  What the heck people? We are the the US of freaking A.  I pray for our soldiers and the politicians that can determine their fate.  Weakness on the part of HRC and BHO.  We need more military serving in elected positions....fewer lawyers and ....!
1723,5.0,"Fantastic movie.  I can stream this free thanks to Prime, but I'm picking up the blu-ray cause I like voting with my wallet.  And this movie deserves all the positive votes it can receive.

Many would classify me as a hardcore conservative.  Maybe I am.  I believe in the Bible front-to-back, God first, family second, country third.  I support our troops.  Doesn't mean I condone every military action our nation is involved in, but the men and women on the front line- I support them.  I want them all to accomplish their mission and then return home safe and sound.

This is a movie about those men.  It shows their sacrifice, their courage, even their weakness (soldiers get scared too).

Love this movie.  I don't consider it biased in anyway.  Be that pro-conservative, anti-us-military, etc.  It's a movie that focuses on the soldiers, tells their story.  That's it.  No political BS thrown in.

So freaking awesome.  Watch this movie.  It is amazing."
1724,3.0,"I'm a big fan of the first one, but the second one honestly wasn't even needed. Guess the industry needed more ""money"".
It's still a good movie, it's nonsense though. There were a few plot threads from the first one that were tied up in here. Otherwise, you actually don't have to see the sequel. I don't know, if you want something completely ridiculous, give this a go.
The first one was better in my opinion.
Kristen Wiig was the star of the show in my opinion, i think if we were to have a show about her i would give it a 10. She was freaking hilarious."
1725,2.0,"Lucy (Troian Bellisario) claims she was tortured as a child (how she escaped is still a mystery) and sees monsters that haunt her. She becomes BFF with Anna (Bailey Noble) who like the audience doesn't know what to believe.

PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD. Ten years later Lucy, somehow out of the blue, finds the couple that tortured her and blows the entire family away with a shotgun...pretty cool stuff. Then the story turns weird as Anna reluctantly goes and helps Lucy clean-up. The weird was pretty good and then we find out what it was all about: People who die with their eyes open (see cover). I prayed...""Please God, don't have the film be this stupid."" Nope. It was. People who died with their freaking eyes open. I believe I would have loved the story more had it been for some DNA mutant experiment instead. Nope. People who die with their eyes open.

Guide: No sex or nudity. 1 F-bomb as I recall. Blood, torture, graphic skin removal scene that made me cringe."
1726,3.0,"Wow, I have a lot of conflicted feelings about this flick. Overall it was pretty freaking creepy. Honestly though it took awhile to really get going for my tastes but it wasn't unbearable. A major problem I had with this movie though was the main camera guy Dan. He was such a terrible human being, like I'm talking borderline sociopath. Everything had to be what he wanted friends and sister be damned. Most of the other characters were alright but they were pretty crappy people as well. I would recommend this movie to people who like found footage movies that get under one's skin, but I can't give this more than three stars because I was to distracted by how terrible the characters were as people, like I don't know which was worse the characters or the slender-man. Speaking of which there was some decent background on the mythology of the slender-man thing but I would have liked a bit more."
1727,2.0,Too vivid and gruesome for me the bear attack is so freaking scary. There's a part of a bastard raping a little girl which caught me by surprise and messed me up. So I don't think I will be watching this movie again. And it is definitely not for kids.
1728,4.0,"Although, I had to fast forward through a couple of scenes, I felt the movie was stunning in detail. As others have stated, the cinematography is amazing, so many beautiful scenes! Leonardo was freaking awesome in his role, although a couple of times I wanted to scream because of a few stupid decisions.

This movie is about a journey of a man who was left for dead. A journey about staying alive and getting revenge on so many levels.

This is a long movie at over two hours but I didn't find it boring at all and it was very different from what I was expecting. I'm glad I decided to take the time to watch it!"
1729,2.0,"This is a 3 star movie, demoted to a 2 star rating, because it should've easily been much better. (NO SPOILERS!)
First off, before I say more... People need to understand one thing and one thing only before watching this film:
This is far more psychological thriller, than a straight out horror flick... Which is why many people are unhappy -- Expected one thing, got another, and they either couldn't enjoy it as a result, or psychological horror/thriller just really isn't their cup of tea.

The Good:
Natalie's acting is superb throughout, something I wasn't sure she could pull off (being basically the sole main character, twice over) especially since her GoT character isn't all that multi-dimensional and haven't really seen what she can do acting-wise, outside of that and Mockingjay)... Anyway... Her acting saves this movie from being Zero to One stars, because had they cast anyone even slightly less talented, it wouldn't have been enough, imo.
-- The cinematography is also really beautiful... Creepy-beautiful at times, but beautiful regardless.  The visual effects, while not terribly original, were very good, albeit reserved mostly toward the end of the movie (as it the case with most movies like this)... Would've liked a few more scary bits (not ""gotcha"", but ""tense-scary bits/scenes"") but there was still a decent amount.

The Bad (and the Ugly):
They try WAY too hard trying to confuse the audience as to whether her fears are justified or whether it's all in her mind.
The pathetic thing is, one of them is an obvious horror-movie ""red herring""; and trying to convince us otherwise, REPEATEDLY, is not only a waste of imaginative possibilities that could have replaced that erroneous and cliched concept; but seriously, it's insulting as hell.
-- It's like the movie Titanic... You know the essential story before you ever go into the theater... The ship sinks and nearly everyone dies.
The film Titanic was named Titanic for a reason, as was Psycho, and as was The Forest.
--- Did Cameron try to convince us that the passengers sank the Titanic using sabotage?... Did Hitchcock try to convince us the Hotel was supernaturally killing its occupants?... NO!... So WTF!?... Honestly, How Did NO ONE Argue This To The Writer &/or Director!?
Obviously, it's still necessary for her to play those emotions and situations because SHE IS unsure sometimes... But WE ARE NOT... and this was never a matter of, ""we see her trying to figure out if it's real or not""... no, this is mostly a case of, ""watch her try to figure it out when she notices it... and in the meantime, here, let me cram some cliched misdirection, shifty glances, creepy gazes, and uncomfortable silences down the throats of the audience (most of which the character is oblivious to) and so that way, the audience will be just as unsure as the character"" and on and on and on...  Look, that kind of film-making works for some movies, IF it's done correctly... BUT THIS IS NOT THAT FILM, and even if it were a film that could work in, THIS IS NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

In summation:
Sloppy, unimaginative writing, opting for a focused and yet half-a##ed ""who's the real culprit"" gag, instead of using ELEMENTS of that, combined with transferred focus on other areas (scares, thrills, drama, backstory, what the hell ever).
I guess mostly it just pisses me off that they think we're really that freaking stupid... that we'd actually believe their ""red herring"" the 3rd or 4th time they tried so desperately to convince us that we should expect the ""red herring twist/reveal"" at any moment.
-- You want to ""plat the seeds of doubt"" once or twice... that's one thing, and it's to be expected... But my God, I lost count of how many times they honestly try to convince the AUDIENCE (instead of the character) which is frankly insane since doing so ensures LESS doubt, not more.
Aside from that VERY annoying aspect of the film, and the disappointment that they didn't really explore the forest and it's mythology to my satisfaction (just a few brief mentions, mostly)... It was a decent film that I wouldn't mind watching again, if I had to... But I'll sure as hell never pay to do so."
1730,4.0,"The writing on this show is the best I've seen/heard in a very long time. The dialogue is so dry...so witty...so, so many fabulous one liners. I am so freaking in love with Frankie's character - but she is me in about 30 years, so I am probably biased. :)

This show is not for the faint of heart. The language, topics, and storylines are in your face (which I love, but more conservative people might not). This is not a cutesy sitcom...it's a blunt, razor sharp, and unapologetic. I love it."
1731,2.0,"It's strange, but looking at the reviews this movie seems to be a love/hate movie. I can't imagine what makes it so polarizing. I found it cringe-worthy.

My biggest gripes: nearly every action scene is cartoonish. A stampeding horde of brontosauruses not only can't outrun humans... it runs with them, over top them, without stepping on anyone. For several minutes. The same problem happens with the rest of the crazy dinosaur/island creatures... they don't seem to adhere to any principle of physics and motion, but gnash and crash and fall down all over the place while magically avoiding the main characters.

Another problem is the love story. Why would a woman care about a freaking monkey? One that has eaten human sacrifices for decades, and that destroys everything whenever he feels like cutting lose. She doesn't recognize that part of him, just that he's a big sweet monkey who has love in his heart too. Aw[...] Not only that she doesn't just seem to like him as a friend. She seems to want to marry him. A 30 foot tall, man eating monkey. Of course, that's the original story, but they failed to help explain it any better.

One more gripe: Jack Black. Great guy, very funny. He screws up this movie because it's not a comedy. Sorry Jack but you don't belong in a dramatic action movie where everyone's waiting for you to crack jokes. He doesn't crack any, by the way, but there's the problem. He's not one of those guys who acts well outside his comedy, and as an important personality in this film it's almost embarrassing to watch him have no dramatic presence.

The one good thing is the visuals (for the most part, sometimes the CG feels disconnected from the actors), there's a lot of beauty shoved into some scenes."
1732,5.0,I can't wait to get the second season this is one of my favorite anime. Also can't to see what is going to happen in the third season. Tatum is awesome and right now I'm watching the ova its freaking awesome!
1733,4.0,"one of my favorite shows of all time, but I think after viewing this season that they have definitely stayed there welcome and the shows skits, antics, and inside jokes are running a little sluggish now. shame this couldn't have been a 10 season show, because all three of these cats and all the supporting actors(actresses) are freaking brilliant."
1734,1.0,"I'm moved to write this review, though it'll probably get lost in a sea
of others, because everyone's claim of a ""crazy twist"" is what drew me
to it. I love twists. Sadly, the twist here is that the ending was such
a deflated balloon of crap that I almost turned it off and I didn't.
The twist is that I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and
didn't keep my eyes on the runtime. The twist is that I have more
patience than I thought I did. Surprise!

The only way other folks could possibly claim that this movie had a
twist at the end is if they were tripping on something strong at the
time AND thought they were either watching a drama or romantic comedy.
Then, maybe, the nonsense that transpires would be surprising. It is
not scary. It's not disturbing. It's not creepy. It doesn't build
tension over time.

Nobody's actions ever ultimately make sense unless you do a ton of digging through the review boards to try to find answers, and even then, it's admittedly full of holes. The really sad thing
is it has me longing for the stupid decisions people make in scary
movies that DO lead to some sort of fright, even if it's a cheap jump
scare. It's not even just that the ending disappoints, it's an entire
premise that sort of makes us feel like jerks for sticking around for
the whole thing.

What everyone has said about plot holes, both within the world of the
movie and the real world, is spot on. What they have said about missed
potential to portray this differently and under another genre is also a
good call. I watched one doll movie over the last few months that
really got me, and a couple that focused more on an entity around the
doll that were decent.

Guys, skip this one. Read the reviews with the spoilers and save
yourself an hour, then spend that hour doing something more exciting
than watching this film, like watering your freaking plants."
1735,5.0,I really can't say anything more about this movie other than what has already been said.  Just a freaking awesome movie!
1736,5.0,"...I've been seeing a lot of negative reviews for the re-release of these three films on DVD. A lot of them are from people that don't even own them giving them a low rating simply because they are mad they already own the extended cuts, and want the documentaries on the new ones, but don't want to purchase them again. Now I don't blame them. I hate when a DVD is re-released many times over with little or no extras that than its predecessor. I however, disagree that they should be rated low simply because angry consumers that already own the previous versions are mad that they don't want to purchase them again. Now they have the right to be angry, but if you don't own them, you should not review them, let alone rate them the lowest score.

In short, you already know how great these movies are, if you do not already own them all, then they make a great buy. I purchased all three since I only owned the Theatrical Cut of ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" I was watching the extended cut last night and it got me all excited again. The box art is pretty freaking cool too, and the fact that they are not huge like the extended editions was a plus for me. They don't take a lot of room, which is good for me because I have soo many movies that the more space I can save the better. The only thing you should know is that although both theatrical and extended cuts are on one disc, you still have to switch the disc over in between the movie--which is really not a big deal. I highly recommend getting these to those that don't own them yet."
1737,4.0,"Fruit of Grisaia (FG) is a harem-thriller mix centered on hitman Yuji Kazami who has had a most unusual childhood and teenhood and gets enrolled in a high school in an attempt to normalize his life. This high school turns out to be just as unusual as his life, a school with only 5 female, attractive, rich and most troubled students who will go crazy about their new classmate.

This is FG, usual anime pleasing our unspeakable-inner-most fantasies. At least it went off from the average harem genre by setting a strong male lead rather than the usual weaklings in many other series. Yuji doesnt bother us freaking out when seeing naked female bodies.

Yuji has a negative and repressive outlook on sex. He grossly derides Amane Suous initial bold sexual advances, both of them tone down, but she continues offering herself. She also takes on his cooking and cleaning.  However Yuji's also has a realistic outlook as he knows that such behavior is not normal. This makes the show interesting and uplifting as Yuji respectfully but firmly sets to get to know and understand Amane. She had a quite traumatic experience where Yuji's sister helped her and seemingly died meanwhile. Therefore she felt in debt with him. I have no idea how realistic that scenario is, but it sure is morbid.

Someone came with the conventional and flawed argument about cultures to explain Amane, see my answer to him. BUT another one did make a good case basing  Amane's actions on guilt, that was more sensible and eventually made me re-rank the anime because Yuji did not think she had to sacrifice like that, let alone thinking she had to die with the rest of her group, a traditional Japanese convention. FG's creators deserve a lot of praise for promoting such human behaviors.

The cases of other girls Michiru, Sachi and maybe Yumiko were slightly uplifting and could resemble Clannad in the way that a strong male lead helps other pretty girls in trouble just to make friends and they trust him easily. Talk about fantasy, yet we need these kind of heroes. The rest was bunk. Yuji gets his ways without many explanations, all he needs to do is being cool and then he can even kill a millionaire gangster (Makinas mother) without much trouble. Even silly series such as Baka and Test are far smarter.

FG displays morbid and misguided views on sex. For instance, Makina Irisu also tries to sexually seduce Yuji, yet later on she lashes out in a hotel at the room of another couple having sex. She talks in morbid ways from time to time.

FG displays the past and reasons to be of each of the girls, but not Yujis. They left his past for a movie and a 2nd season, which I only skimmed thought briefly. If you want fan service FG has a fair amount, sex is good if you like it implicit. As for a thriller, it's sloppy. All in all FG is fairly entertaining and stands out for Amane's story and Yuji's choices, as well as his tolerant ways."
1738,5.0,"While on a flight to Puerto Rico for 10 hours recently I got to watch this.  Now you see, I am a self-confessed Dis-Nerd.  I freaking LOVE me some Disney, anything Disney and I am happy.  And yes I am a 33 year old adult.  While sitting on the redeye looking through the movie choices I found this so of course I had to watch it.  I cant sleep on any flight no matter how tired I am.

This movie is so well done!  It is hilarious throughout, with tons of adult humor and funny puns.  I was laughing so hard that I woke people up and kept startling my sleeping hubby.  The movie is great for kids, is always interesting and is over super cute and wholesome.  Disney for the win!"
1739,5.0,"This show is freaking awesome!  I absolutely love anything on PBS because they truly make the most visually stunning shows and are right on par with historical accuracy.  The main actor is phenomenal.  He is so wells spoken, so compelling, so interesting that its impossible to not want to know what happens in the next episode.
Pro:
- Visually stunning
- The clothing and costume are a thing of beauty ( I want all the gowns!)
- Historically accurate and gets all the details right  (even the cosmetics are correct at the store)
- Easy to understand the actors and follow along
- You will want to teleport back to WWI and shop in their store
- The love stories are so well done be sure to have some Kleenex around
Con:
- The fourth season is the last season! 
- I don't get to shop at Mr. Selfridges"
1740,5.0,I got it Monday 6/20/16. Thad is freaking fast. They only burn story ON ONE SIDE. Which is great. We watching first disc now. It is crisp and clear. Story of a man. A Lawman bringing law and order to a town. All the people he meat and things go right and wrong in the west. Great watch.
1741,4.0,"So I finally got the time to review this event (I guess I am a little behind) and I am a little on the fence about the event.  I felt that it had some fantastic moments but there were also some moments where I was left shaking my head (especially since I have seen what has happened since the event has aired which we will talk about).  Anyway, I thought that the event was half descent so here is what I thought of the event.  (There will be spoilers because let's face it, the event happened like 2 months ago so most of know the results already anyway)

The event begins with a pretty good rendition of America, the Beautiful by Fifth Harmony which leads into a pretty good standard opening promo.  I think most of felt that the event would begin with the ladder match for the IC title and we were right.  This is almost always a good way to start a show and get the crowd into it.  So the first match up was for the Intercontinental title in a Ladder match.  The match featured Kevin Owens, Zack Ryder, Sami Zayn, Dolph Ziggler, Sin Cara, Stardust and the Miz.  I have to say that I felt that Owens was going to win or maybe Zayn.  Never in my wildest dreams did I think Ryder was going to win.  It was such a shock and just a great way to open the show.  I like it when the WWE surprises me (which they still do once in a while).  The match itself was wild with Sin Cara taking some huge bumps and Owens taking a massive bump on his head that I thought was going to give him a pretty good concussion but it didn't.  Anyway good match.  (9/10)

After that we get a commercial (still don't understand why the WWE needs to play these freaking things because eventually it gets to be like watching television).  Next we get the events that led up to Styles/Jericho IV.  So the next match would be AJ Styles taking on Chris Jericho for a 4th time.  These two have had some great matches in the past and this one was no different.  Seeing AJ compete at Wrestlemania has been a dream of mine for years and he did not disappoint at all.  The match was fantastic and very competitive.  I did think (and was right) that AJ would lose.  First off, I never understood why he was booked in this match anyway.  They had their trilogy which AJ won and now they were having a 4th match!  Why?  I also knew that Vince would never let someone who had great success in other companies win at his show (just look at the previous year when he had Sting lose for the love of God).  Other than that though, the match was a great success and one that I enjoyed.  (10/10)

After that we get another commercial, a post match interview with Zack Ryder and a special ring introduction for the New Day which featured them coming out of a box of Booty O's which was great.  The next match would be the New Day taking on the League of Nations which had Sheamus, Alberto del Rio and Rusev.  The match itself was actually pretty good and had each member of each team showing off their skills.  I don't think the League should have won but that's what happened.  After the match we see them cut a promo which leads to Mick Foley, Shawn Michaels and Steve Austin coming out to shut them up.  That was great but I wish they would have been used another way.  Still, the match was entertaining and it was great to see the 3 legends team up as well.  (7/10)

So after this match we see all the events that led up to the Street Fight between Brock Lesnar and Dean Ambrose.  This match really disappointed me.  I thought it was going to be so much better than a basic squash match.  I mean they made Dean look so weak against Lesnar.  Honestly, all Lesnar did for 13:00 was suplex Dean which is getting a little old to watch.  I mean I know he has the whole Suplex City thing and all that but it gets old seeing him do just that.  I thought the match would have been so much better and I think the fans at AT@T stadium did also.  (5/10)

So after that match we get a Snickers commercial featuring Ric Flair, Zack Ryder and Charlotte.  We also see footage of the Hall of Fame ceremony and the introduction of the Hall of Fame class for 2016 which this year was kind of an up and down class.  First off we see Joan Lunden get the Warrior Award for her battle with cancer. We also see Snoop Dogg go in the celebrity wing as well.  We did get to finally see the Freebirds go in (I felt this should have happened at WM 25).  Unfortunately we did not get to see Terry Gordy or Buddy Roberts go in as they have since passed on but we did get to see Michael Haynes and Jimmy Garvin speak. They did have Kevin Von Erich come out as well but a lot of what he said made no sense.  We also saw Stan Hansen (great) go in, Jacqueline (great), The Godfather, Big Bossman and Sting (finally) go in.  During Sting's induction we do find out that he has decided to retire making it that much more of a sad affair.

After all of that we see some footage of Lita retiring the Divas title and renaming it the WWE Women's Championship and it would go to the winner of the women's triple threat match that night.  That match would feature Charlotte taking on Sasha Banks and Becky Lynch.  This match was awesome!  It may have been the match of the night.  Everyone performed like beasts in that ring.  Sasha did mess up one move but it was wasn't all that bad.  Charlotte took the match over.  She rocked it and in my opinion may have been the MVP of the night.  Se would pick up the win and take the newly crafted title back with her.  This was just a fantastic contest and may have been the best women's match ever put on at a WM event.  (10/10)

So after that we get the events that led up to the Hell in a Cell match with Undertaker taking on Shane McMahon.  The whole ""selling point"" of the match was that if Shane won he would get control of Raw away from Vince and Stephanie and Taker would never be able to wrestle again at a WM event.  I've heard that the original plan was for Taker to take on John Cena but after Cena went down with an injury this is what we get.  The match itself was not bad (I don't care what other people say).  The first 12:00 or so was pretty boring but after that the match really picks up with some great highspots including Shane jumping off the top of the cage to go through a table.  The match itself is a little over 30:00 with Taker picking up the win.  What I hated was what happened the next night on Raw.  Vince gave Shane control of Raw that night and the next week and the next and so on, so it was like what was the point of the match?  Shane lost but he still gained control.  It made no sense whatsoever.  Other than that, the match was pretty good.  Let's face it:  It could have been worse.  A lot worse.  (8/10)

After that we get another commercial and some talking points with the pre-show crew.  After that we get the Andre the Giant Battle Royal which sees NXT star Baron Corbin win.  I was happy about this because I actually like Corbin.  He reminds me of a young Barry Windham.  The battle royal itself was pretty standard but the ending made it surprising and exciting.  (7/10)

After that we get another commercial and then the venue for WM 33 is announced (Orlando again?) and then there is a performance by the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders.  The Rock then has to come out and it takes him freaking forever to get to the ring because he has to play to the crowd and then he has to light his name on fire with this blow torch and then he has to strut to the ring and then he has to talk and talk and then he has to tell us all about the attendance record set that night.  Finally the Wyatts come out to confront him which was pretty good.  This all somehow leads to a ""match"" with Erik Rowan (all of 6 seconds) which the Rock wins.  The Wyatts again and then a still healing Cena comes out to help and it was basically 20 -25 mins that we will never get back.  I would have liked to have seen Rock take on Bray Wyatt because Bray is so good and always buried that it isn't funny but once again he is thought of as an after thought.

After that we get another commercial and the events that led up to the main event.  What a crap match!  It was terrible!  By now the event was already over 4 hours and now we had to sit for another 27:00 boring minutes just to see Roman Reigns beat Triple H for the title (something everyone already knew which was no surprise).  It was just bad.  Triple H is good but even he couldn't turn this match around into something good.  (5/10)

 I have heard that the WWE had placed microphones around the stadium to make it sound really loud in there but it backfired with Reigns.  The fans were booing him so badly that the WWE had to turn off some of the microphones to make it sound like he was turning the fans around when in fact they were still booing the crap out of him.  All in all, it was just a bad final hour to the show.  Between the Rock and his stupid stuff he had to do, to the main event it was just a bad last hour.  Plus, I watched this on the Network which had streaming issues the whole night with the screen freezing up and getting all pixelated to HD going in and out.

All in all the event wasn't too bad (I would say a 7/10) but it wasn't great either.  It suffered from being WAY overblown clocking in at like 4 hours and 50 mins to the Rock segment which bored fans to the main event which bored fans as well.  The rest of the show was actually pretty good with just minor things that were bad here and there."
1742,5.0,"Guillermo del Toro has become one of cinema's true film magicians throughout his career, which started with a steampunk-sprinkled vampire yarn titled Cronos, and has seen films made about ghost stories, super heroes, and giant freaking cockroaches. It is with Pan's Labyrinth, however, that del Toro makes his name known to all. Simply put, this film is perfection, and a true dark fairy tale. It is a film that represents the innocence of a young child, a theme del Toro visited earlier in his 2001 ghost story The Devil's Backbone&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Backbone-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B00CEIOH3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Backbone (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]. This film is at times ultra-violent and appealing to the child in even the most cynical adult, yet also one of the most visually stimulating films ever made. It's basically Guillermo del Toro's mind poured out into a film canister.

I own the single-disc DVD version of the film, which contains a video prologue by the director as well as del Toro's feature-length audio commentary. It's in the original aspect ratio (1.85.1) and a very good and easy to understand English subtitle translation of the Spanish-language film. The picture is clear and crisp and really shows off the film's visual nature.

A great product representative of an equally great film!"
1743,3.0,"This movie will only appeal to slightly psychologically damaged, clever individuals capable of viewing, feeling and experiencing darkness without running for cover or pressing the stop button on the remote. Tony Soprano would love this film.

Visually sumptuous and exceedingly violent, this is a film which assumes the viewer has some knowledge of authentic fairy tales and ancient myths of the distant past where there are no generic and formulaic happy endings featuring (thank God), where Snow White dies as a result of eating the poisoned apple and where Sleeping Beauty never does awaken from her coma.

The extras on Disc 2 will help you understand the film on a deeper level  so if you are ignorant about such things, go ahead and watch Disc 2 first. That way you'll have a far greater appreciation for the film.

Regarding the horrific violence; it's not gratuitous and I loved it.  The aggression and sadism only added o the R-rated appeal of a fairy tale film, like Anne Rice's Beauty Series. Once again, this isn't a movie for dim witted artistically conservative viewers.

Reading the previous reviews, I noticed tons of idiots complaining about the subtitles...are you freaking kidding me? What's the matter with these idiots, can't they read English? If your biggest gripe about this movie is the subtitles then understand this- you're an idiot."

1748,4.0,"Nine Things About the Film ""10 Cloverfield Lane""

1. This movie is not a sequel to Cloverfield. The only surface connection between the movies is that they both have the word ""Cloverfield"" in the title. Sharp observers (or those following the Tagruato Corporation website) will notice that both movies take place in the same universe, but that's all. You can watch this movie without knowing that Cloverfield even exists.

2. This is not a horror movie. It's a thriller with some science fiction elements thrown in. Don't expect this movie to be scary. You will be disappointed.

3. It's about a woman named Michelle who is freaking out about her boyfriend. While driving through rural Louisiana in the night, gets into a car accident. She wakes up in a bunker with two other men, and is told she can't leave for a couple of years.

4. Most of the stuff you see in the trailer happens in the first half of the film.

5. The movie is told strictly from Michelle's point of view, so you are just as confused as she is. You also become just as suspicious and paranoid as she does.

6. John Goodman does an awesome job in this movie, as a doomsday prepper and conspiracy theorist trying to hold himself together in a situation that he didn't quite imagine.

7. There is some real suspense in this movie, as well as some plot twists that I honestly didn't see coming.

8. Some people will find the movie anti-climactic and not worth the build up (see point 2). But I thought it was well done; it fit the story's idea that everybody can be right, and everybody can be wrong, all at the same time.

9. This is a tightly crafted paranoid thriller. If you can forget about the movie's namesake and just go in blind, it will take you on a worthwhile journey. I'm hoping there will be a third movie that's not a sequel."
1749,5.0,"Rooster Teeth; vaunted creators of the longest running web series in history, Red vs. Blue. In 2013 they debuted RWBY, the animated series created and produced but the late, beloved, and sorely missed Monty Oum. Released originally as a series of short webisodes on their website (and later to other streaming services like YouTube, Crunchyroll, and Netflix). RWBY's first ""season"" was released on Blu Ray as Volume 1, which combined the first 12 or so episodes into something of a feature-length film. Near the end of 2014, Rooster Teeth released Volume 2, the combination of ""season 2"" and after a year of frothing at the mouth, Volume 3 was released on May 3rd, 2016. I was fortunate enough to grab a copy of the latest Blu Ray release and true to form, am thoroughly impressed with Rooster Teeth Production's latest RWBY release, the first after the passing of Monty Oum.

Prior to digging into the latest release I want to throw out there a bit of a synopsis for both Volume 1 and Volume 2. Minor spoilers may occur from this point down (though I will avoid them if I can), so consider yourself warned.

Volume 1 synopsis: Volume 1, as a continuous ""feature length"" film feels a bit disjointed at times, as it is difficult to combine multiple arcs into a single, unbroken 2 hour long film. The first third of the film, or ""arc,"" introduces the primary characters for the series: Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna and Yang Xiao Long (Team RWBY, pronounced ""ruby""). Character development is solid, though the second ""arc"" (or middle third of the video) focuses on the secondary characters, Jaune Arc, Nora Valkyrie, Pyrrha Nikos, and Lie Ren (team JNPR, pronounced ""juniper""). The third and final arc introduces a series of sub-plots and a general overall ""arc"" that the series would presumably work towards resolving.

Volume 2 synopsis: Starting off directly after the end of the first Volume, Volume 2 introduces more villains, amongst whom is Cinder, voiced by the incredibly popular cosplayer Jessica Nigri. Over the course of nearly 2  hours, team RWBY is given significant character development, especially Blake. The pacing for Volume 2 is far better than the slightly disjointed Volume 1 and ended in a more satisfyingly manner.

On to the meat of today's review  Volume 3 on Blu Ray comes neatly packaged in the traditional Blu Ray case and contains a pair of monochromatically adorned discs. Like most Blu Ray movies, you receive an actual Blu Ray as well as a standard DVD, and when viewing in their respective players on appropriate displays, both are stunning. This is likely lent to the CG-style animation that is used throughout the series, but the DVD version looks sharp and crisp on my old 1200x800, 2010 MacBook Pro, though the colors are significantly more vibrant, lines are sharper, and the overall look of the Blu Ray disc played in my PlayStation 4 on my 1080p television still puts the original DVD to shame.

On the subject of animation quality, you can certainly tell that even between Volumes 1 and 2, Rooster Teeth animators and artists significantly improved. Backgrounds are especially noticeable when comparing the first season to the third, but that is not all. In Volumes 1 and 2 the action sequences are to die for, but the times between action scenes feel a bit wooden at times; forgivable in my opinion, because the action is simply THAT GOOD. Volume 3 steps it up a notch and truly looks like a tradition CG+painted anime, which gorgeous models, wonderful lip syncing, and utterly stunning backgrounds.

Running along the same vein is the voice acting; RWBY started strong with voice acting, but the series has only gotten better (Weiss especially; I am utterly smitten with Kara Eberle  and am fairly certain I would be reduced to a gibbering idiot were I to ever meet her). The actors' growing experience is definitely showing, as there is far more feeling in each character. In terms of audio the series is excellent, and Volume 3 is the crowning example of quality American voice-acting, however  The music, which was stunning in Volume 1, seems to have taken a back seat in Volumes 2 and 3, foregoing the voiced punk/rock motif of the first Volume, and moving towards a more instrumental aspect in the later Volumes. Not terrible, but a step backwards, and while not distracting, the music does not have quite the punch that it did in the first volume (though the songs with lyrics do appear occasionally in Volume 2, they do not appear as often as Volume 1).

Given how Volume 2 ended, I was unsure how Volume 3 would start; while the overall arc has yet to be satisfied, Volume 2 ended at a fairly solid arc ending. Volume 3 opens with an anime classic  a tournament (that is briefly mentioned in passing in Volume 2) and while the action is superb and art stellar, what I was completely not expecting was how freaking funny the first half hour of the show is. I am fairly certain that the single best line in the series is ""Silence you boob!"" Said by the ultra stern big sister of Weiss; the way she says it is just  hilarious (helps that it is accompanied by a hearty open-handed slap). Setting the relatively light tone at the start keeps on throughout the Volume while balancing some relatively heavy actions and an arc that is by far the best in the series to date. Frankly put, I can only imagine Monty Oum would be proud and honored.

In addition to the feature length ""film,"" there are a handful of trailers and extras on the Blu Ray disc. I strongly recommend spending the hour or so it takes to poke through the trailers, the audio commentary (which is great) and the Behind the Scenes featurette.

RWBY Volume 3 on Blu Ray is absolutely a must have and shows the growth and evolution of Rooster Teeth Productions, as it contains the best of all of the aspects that made Rooster Teeth who they are today."
1750,2.0,"I had high hopes but the movie fell flat. It was a corny storyline and I didn't buy it. The main character's suspicions were a bit far fetched in the beginning. Like,  why the hell  is he freaking out because the couple tries to lock thier front door... in LA??? The acting was also pretty subpar. The main character did a pretty good job, even though his brooding kinda wore on me a bit. The rest of the acting was godawful."
1751,4.0,"I, like everyone else writing a review for this release, have only scene the theatrical version. Based on what I saw in the theaters (I saw it 4 times!) there are a lot of good and bad things about this movie, mostly good. While it did stray from historic comic book plots and characters, what director Brett Ratner envisioned is a fine and acceptable, if not a really good, story.

The story, special effects, and the acting were excellent.

 The story, while there are those who'll say otherwise, was really good. The X-men find out from The Secretary of Mutant Affairs, aka Beast, that there is a threat to mutant kind. A child, played by Cameron Bright, has the ""uncanny"" (pardon the pun) ability to ""leech"" any mutants powers. The effect is temporary and only while the mutant is within about 10-15ft from him. However the military uses the kid's blood to make (any guesses?) a weapon, of course. This causes a flurry of reactions from the mutant comunity. Some mutants want ""the cure"" some want it destroyed. I don't want to ruin the story so I'll just say it is a pretty acurate depiction of what would happen. I was kind of dissapointed that not any muntants from other Marvel series were involved. I thought it would be an excellent chance for some cross-over characters to make a few cameo apearances. While the comic book fanatics were freaking out about the differences from the movie to the comics, they were not paying atention to the really great story.

The special effects were up to the same level, if not better, as the first 2 entries in this series. There is a really great scene where Beast, played by Kelsey Grammer (aka Frasier), reaches out to touch the Leech (C. Bright), and his hand becomes a normal looking human hand. There is also a scene that has Cyclops, played by James Marsden, blasting Alkalie Lake, where Jean Grey drowned. Also when the Phoenix is around...get ready for special effects to wow you.

The acting was, as always when you have Patrick Stewart, superb. Everyone from Halle Berry, who plays Storm, to Vinnie Jones, who plays Juggernaut, did a fine job. I only can complain about one actor...Cameron Bright, who plays the Leech (the kid who has the negating power). He says about 3 words through the whole movie. From what I've seen of the kid he has played basically the same character in every movie he's been in. This small negative does not take away from the movie as a whole. He only has about 4 scenes anyway.

All in all this is a fantasic movie. You must make it a point to watch the extra scenes at the end of the credits. A lot of story happens in those few scenes, and you don't want to miss them. The last few moments of these scenes cement the idea of another X-Men sequal. Which is a great idea. There is only like 40 years of stories to cover. I, for one, will go see every X-Men movie they make."

1753,1.0,"While a big fan of both Frank Miller and Zack Snyder (see my insightful comments on his Dawn of the Dead remake), this movie was unambiguously awful. It is a mystery to me how the average rating is even 3.5 stars. Have you people all gone completely insane? Has Amazon finally rigged its reviews to encourage online rentals? When Frank Miller redefined the traditional Batman character in the 80s, it was like a nuclear bomb in the comics book world. Sure, Miller had already made a name for himself with Daredevil and Ronin, but his work on Batman launched him into the stratosphere. Snyder also adapted 300 (another Miller comic) and Watchman to the silver screen, so the guy is almost certainly a huge fan of comics from that era. So what went wrong?

(1) If you really want someone to play the dark knight, then find some cranky guy in his 50s or 60s. Like anyone from the Expendables cast.
(2) When did superman become such a prick? In Miller's work he was more like a soldier following orders, Snyder's superman is constantly angry and scowling for more or less no reason.
(3) Whats with all the dark lighting and grey tones? When was Gotham ever that depressing? No wonder superman is so grumpy.
(4) What was going on with wonder woman and aquaman? They were barely recognizable. I'm not a purist when it comes to costumes, but I sort of think if a director wants to create a new character, they should just create a new character instead of completely revamping old ones.
(5) Snyder's bastardization of the the beloved General Zod character (immortalized forever by Terence Stamp) was totally unnecessary. In spite of all this other crapola, this movie could have worked as a love/hate triangle between Batman and Superman and Luthor. But (5) was the last freaking straw for me.
(6) Why is this called the Dawn of Justice? Was justice truly absent from Gotham really before these guys in capes started chasing criminals around? Police and courts seemed to be trying to enforce the laws, so whats with the snarky remark? Huh?

Snyder is a talented director, and I fully expect his next movie will provide him with some level of redemption for this nightmare he has wrought upon the world. But its difficult to say anything positive about this movie, except that I thought Eisenberg's performance of Lex Luthor was sublime. It is my personal opinion that he lived up to the ridiculously high standards set by Gene Hackman and Michael Rosenbaum. It appears not everyone shares my opinion of Eisenberg, and perhaps this reflects the natural variation that occurs in the appreciation of any experience good. But (1) - (6) are just objective facts which are beyond dispute."
1754,3.0,"If you are going to see this movie, then make sure you see the Extended Edition.  It is far better than the theatrical version.  It makes a disappointing movie at least watchable.  I went into this movie with low expectations, after reading all the negative reviews.  It wasn't near as bad as I had heard, but I can understand why people didn't like it.  Terrible directing and bad villains nearly sunk this movie. ** SPOILERS AHEAD ** The very worst thing about this movie is the main villain.  OMG.  They don't even give you Lex Luthor.  Nope, they give you Lex Luthor's son, which is horribly over played by Jesse Eisenberg.  I like him as an actor, but someone forgot to mention to him that he's not the freaking Joker.  That's what you got.  That's where some of the bad directing comes in.  Zach Snyder should have sat him down and told him to tone it down a bit.  Instead, he let him try and channel Heath Ledger's Joker.  It fails on every level.  He really hates Superman though.  Why?  Who knows.  We are never given any real reason why. so he's a nut case without any real motivation.  Doesn't work.  Which brings me to my next subject, the directing.  There are some major plot holes in this movie that look to me as a clear case of director laziness.  The entire motivation for the Batman/Superman fight is nonsensical.  One little sentence from Superman would have stopped the fight.  He doesn't say it.  Why?  It's because Snyner is a lazy director who couldn't come up with anything better.  There are other such moments in the movie where a normal common sense person would have said a phrase or two, that would have made a difference, but didn't.  That's just lazy film making.  Then he decides to change the entire character of Batman.  He's literally a killer now.  --eyes rolling.  One of the things that made Batman great was his absolute rule of not taking a life.  That's what made him so interesting.  Zach Snyder decided to remove that and go the Deadpool route.  Bad move.  Of course, the movie also has some good things going for it too.  I really liked Jeremy Irons as Alfred.  Lois Lane was great.  She actually contributed a lot to the story instead of just being a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued.  Ben Afflec did a pretty good job as Bruce Wayne.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The fight scenes were terrific.  The Batman fight scenes were very well done as was the battle vs Superman.  The Doomsday fight was just MEH.  It was just an explosion of CGI al-la-Transformers.  Henry Cavill is a great Superman, so no complaints there either.  Wonder Woman gets an A+ from me.  Gal Gadot really nailed that part.  Overall though, this isn't a great movie.  Just a good one.  Not even in the same class as the Captain America movies.  Hopefully DC gets their act together and starts putting out better films."
1755,1.0,"The director, producers and screen writers should be required to READ the old comic books before they are allowed to use the names Superman and Batman.  This is the most ridiculous version of a  Batman or Superman movie I have ever attempted to watch.  OH and let us not forget the insertion of Wonder Woman in Black.  I guess there is a requirement to add Girl Power to ever movie these days.

The absolute depression of the people who are responsible for this dribble version of a known Super heroes movie,  shows in the staging, the presentation and the attempt to destroy a valid and long-lived story line of DC characters.

One with an IQ above room temperature would wonder where the hell did Batman get an Iron Man suit.  Also one would wonder if Wonder Woman Dianna Prince been hiding out in Washington D.C. for over a hundred years why the hell no one ever noticed that she did not age.

And of course anyone who can THINK would wonder what the hell was wrong with Bruce Wayne that allowed him to be FLIPPED by fake newspaper articles sent to him by a mentally diminished Lex Luthor.  I wonder if those responsible for this D.S. movie knows why Lex Luthor has a hatred for Superman.  CLUE: It started with Superboy.

And then there is the freaking monster that looks a lot like other cartoon monsters that have been in so many poorly presented movies.  The glowing eyes, the Ben Grimms facial features and the XXXX shirt size.

This movie is very poorly written, poorly staged, and poorly presented. and it varies so much from the original concept of Superman Batman and Wonder Woman that the producers should be sued for plagiarism for using the names of well established Super Heroes to get people to look at this crap.

Those who are saying that they love this movie must be either paid by the studios, given free copies of the movie, or totally without any prior knowledge of these Justice League characters.

Chose to watch, but suspend any knowledge of Superman, Batman or Wonder Woman because this a misrepresentation, so greatly lower your expectations."

1757,3.0,"Let's just get this over with.  If you like meaningless films where goofiness reigns supreme, JUMPER is your nirvana.  A young man named David (a bewildered-looking Hayden Christensen) discovers he has the ability to ""jump"" (teleport) from one location to another--anywhere in the world.  So what does he do?  Um, rob banks to set up a cushy lifestyle so he can pick up chicks by night in London and have lunch on top of the Great Sphinx of Egypt.

Heaven forbid young David would do anything constructive with such an extraordinary gift. . .

But wait.  There's more.  David discovers he's not alone; there are other jumpers out there (and they're all young adults; go figure).  And these jumpers are being pursued by paladins--sanctimonious Bible thumpers devoted to kill all jumpers because (we suppose, as we're never really given an explanation) they are ""evil.""  The paladins are led by a white-haired, very devout Samuel L. Jackson.  So, bewildered-looking David teams up with a fellow jumper (Jamie Bell, who is a not-so-nice jumper) to battle Jackson and the paladins--and that's when the goofiness takes over to the point poor girlfriend's (Rachel Bilson) apartment is totally trashed.

Oh, and the electric ""ropes"" the paladins use to trap the jumpers so reminded me of plumbing snakes.  Just an observation.

And the gorgeous Diane Lane is totally and utterly wasted in her brief appearances.  Yet I give this stinker three stars because director Doug Liman furnishes eye-opening vistas, visuals, and special effects to demonstrate at least someone brought some imagination to the set.

1758,5.0,"I freaking loved this movie! It's funny, fast-paced, the characters come alive instantly, the plot is great, the actors were phenomenal, and OMG Leonard Nimoy is in it too! YAY! LOVE LOVE LOVE. BUY BUY BUY!!! XD"
1759,1.0,"I am going to spare everyone a summary of the plot and cut to the chase: while this movie was entertaining with a handsome cast and flashy scenes, it was not Star Trek.. If you had named it, let's say ""Space Academy - the Early Years"" it would be pretty ok but naming it Star Trek is sort of like throwing a bucket of acrylic paint at the Mona Lisa and calling it art. If you don't know much about Star Trek and don't care too much about internal consistency in a movie in general, character development, plausibility or a plot for that matter, then this is the movie for you. As a matter of fact I believe that one of the reasons this movie has proven to be very popular among non-Star Trek fans is because it is not Star Trek!! It is a glossy reboot of the original with little substance beneath its action-packed surface and pretty faces, resembling more an MTV video. Here are some of the more serious issues with this movie:

+ All of the ""acting"" is 'over the top' and everyone is exaggerated, to the point of clownish buffonery. Kirk (or Chris Pine really) appears to have ADD or something and he is arrogant, cocky, erratic, tactless and obnoxious. I was so annoyed early on with him already that I actually enjoyed watching him being beaten up at the bar. A cutsey boy cadet who walks on a bridge and says, ""I'm in charge"". You have got to be kidding me. Not only that but an Admiral placing him as second in command of a ship? Wow.

+ Lightning fast cuts from one scene to another like an MTV video and really poor plot where all the Enterprise crew just happen to find themselves together even though their entire respective pasts have been inexorably changed? Ridiculous.

+ The back stories behind how the original characters met was insulting and every tagline from the original series was used most inappropriately, as if they had a list of lines required to be used so that they could show at least some resemblance to the original show. Instead of spending time on developing each character, such as Spock's inner struggle and Kirk fighting his demons and finally turning from a repeat offender to a serious and devoted Starfleet officer, they forwarded (literally) all that to focus more on CGI effects and visuals.

+ Speaking of visuals: The interior of the Enterprise looks like a Bloomingdale's make-up counter. How ridiculous and untrue to even an altered timeline was that? The interior of ships in the 24th century didn't look this chic.

+ The villain was uninspired and dumb. Seriously. I mean here you got this Romulan (who doesn't even remotely look Romulan by the way and has super strength) who saw his entire planet be destroyed by a ""galaxy threatening supernova"" (!). Then, he is flung 200 years into the past, with a tub of super future material and nothing to do. Now, what would you do in this situation? If it were me, I might, oh, I don't know, WARN MY CIVILIZATION. Given 200 years of lead time, an evacuation would not be all that difficult. OK, let's say I'm a little bit crazy. What might I do then? Nero says he wants to create a world in which Romulus exists without the Federation. What might be the best way of achieving this? I might, oh, I don't know, GO TO ROMULUS, give them all this fantastic future technology, and become emperor of a civilization 200 years in advance of everyone else out there. What does Nero actually do? He goes it alone. Because, you know, shut up, that's why. He then decides to obliterate _an entire planet_ based on said faulty intelligence and wait 25 freaking years for Spock to show up so he can exact revenge. He then also just so happens to maroon Spock on a planet that just so happens to have a Starfleet base on it where he can oh so conveniently run into the new Kirk and inform him that it just so happens that his and new Spock's destiny is to be friends at all costs apparently. How so very inconvenient. Yup, that's the villain. There is no passion, no substance, no character, apparently also no intelligence behind his person and motive other than what was written in the script for him to act like.

+ The product placement was so obvious. Way to promote an enlightened future in which all of human kinds' ills coming from money and economic deprivation have been eradicated - by having something like 20 millions worth of product placement in there.

+ Bones: The reason for why McCoy says he is called ""bones"" was totally pulled out of the writers' butts in this movie. The expression comes from civil war time doctors who had to use saws to amputate legs. The term ""bones"" (which Kirk called McCoy in The Original Series) comes from that. In this stupid movie McCoy says ""in a divorce my wife got everything and left me dry to my BONES"" and they use that to explain why Kirk calls him ""bones"". Ridiculous.

+ If this is a future in which money has been eradicated (and lawyers executed), how can McCoy _lose_ everything he has in a divorce and be left ""dry to his bones""?

+ The Star Trek series, especially Star Trek: The Next Generation, brought in top scientific minds to advise about what is and is not science and how they can take an idea and transform it such that, even though it is science-fiction, it is still scientifically consistent and coherent.  This movie spent a lot of time on special effects, flashy scenes and catchy one-liners but very little on rationalizing the science and incorporating it intelligently into the movie to create consistency. They dumbed the whole premise down to a grade school level and some of the things they are trying to pass as ""science"" would make the head of any Star Trek regular writer spin in disbelief. That's what happens though when you set out to deliver bread and circuses to the masses. Ships flying through Black Holes and coming out the other side intact? Enterprise escapes the black hole by blowing up the warp core inside of it? Ski diving onto a platform FROM SPACE? A mining ship annihilating an entire planet?

+ The writers seemed to be thinking  that simply because this is science fiction, any kind of implausible garbage they come up with goes. Sci-fi doesnt equal magic though and the one thing Star Trek didn't rely on was magic bullets to explain phenomena and anomalies etc. In this movie, the most absurd stuff goes down and we are to believe it makes sense because the genre is sci-fi and the writers say so? How stupid do they actually think people are?

+ This movie is not true to Star Trek in even a rudimentary way. It is not intelligent, or thought provoking. It is not about space exploration and asking the tough questions, there is no ttempt at science, philosophy. Nothing. This is Star Trek the way only a product of the over-stimulated times we live in could make it. Cheeky, sexy, and dumb.

+ Speaking of inconsistency: Spock's and Kirk's relationship in this movie is adversarial from the start and all they do is argue and fight and at some point Spock is juts about to strangle Kirk. Yet in the end, somehow out of the blue, they become good friends, because the old Spock says they were in another life. That is completely inconsistent with how the characters have behaved and been portrayed throughout the movie as you cannot just push the button and say ""hey, I am good friends with you now"". That is just bad writing folks. If you cant even get something like character consistency within a plot right, you are a lousy writer. How Orci and Kurtzman are still with a job and get to write the sequels is truly beyond me.

+ Kirk's  promotion: how does a cadet go from being suspended for cheating to becoming the captain of one of Starfleet's most prestigious spaceships less than a week later? Yes he saved Earth, but come on. That scene where he is decorated as the second coming of Zefram Cochrane, by the same man who just a few days ago held the hearing on his cheating ways, was ridiculous. A cadet getting full command of a flagship while his instructor, in whose class he cheated and was caught, gets to serve under him as second in command? Laughable...if I was Spock, Vulcan stoicism or not, I would have taken the matter to Starfleet command.

+ McCoy's character played by Karl Urban seemed too old and sophisticated to be a Starfleet cadet, especially among this group of immature rascals. He seemed to be the only adult amidst this circus where a child (Kirk) was getting to play captain or something. Even though Urban did a fantastic job playing McCoy, they should have cast him either next to a more mature cast of Kirks and Spocks or cast him as an admiral or something. He really was the only one who wasn't out of his mind.

+ More than 600 episodes from Star Trek: The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager are all rendered invalid, because a couple of writers, who I must mention  have never even written a Star Trek episode before, had so little creative talent that their best idea was Well, why don't we just change the whole time-line, then we don't have to worry about established details and accurate characterizations. I am sure it's a good way for the writers and producers to turn a fast buck but Star Trek is part of pop culture. The continuity so lovingly and painstakingly preserved by all the movies, TV series and novels subsequent to the The Original Series has been destroyed with this movie. You don't have to be a Trek geek to find that outrageous.

+ It is sad to know that the last time I, or anyone of us, will probably EVER see Leonard Nimoy do the Vulcan salute is in this nasty piece of tourist trinket!

Bottom line: Somehow it all felt very untrue to the essence of Star Trek. It was too Hollywood and glammy and very little story and depth. If you like bling and lots of mind-less action and nail-biting sequences and good looking, hollow characters having music-video length ""dialogs"" with each other while flashing their handsomeness in front of smooth, shiny surfaces and catchy shots,  then this is the movie for you. But if you expect substance, drama, depth, coherence and plausibility, then you are in the wrong place. They had a lot of potential with this one but they just missed it. Since they were going to make sequels, they should have spent more time truly developing the characters and their relationships with one another and just the beginnings of their journey rather than rushing through that part and getting into some mind-less, pointless, absurd plot involving an insane yet at the same time comical Frankenstein's Romulan monster. They just missed all that and it felt rushed. The creative angle was missing and you could literally see dollar signs hanging from every cgi shot. Open up a spot for Jackie Chan, 20 ninjas and Lindsey Lohan in the sequel and the abomination will be complete."
1760,5.0,"This is not the Star Trek of my youth, and I was a big fan - yet this movie delivers the freaking goods in ways that the wussy-fied Star Trek of the nineties could only dream about (Deep Space Nine, Voyager).  In this film, we're no longer in conflict about sipping 'tainted' mushroom soup (see Voyager - no, don't see it), now the stakes are real, larger than life, and important in the journey of this young crew. The entire cast raises the bar on performances, interaction, good chemistry and comedic timing.  It's uncanny how much Zachary Quinto resembles Leonard Nimoy in the role of Spock, while still putting his own tweak to the character. Chris Pine IS Captain Kirk.
Dr. McCoy is lovable and comedic and played to a ""T ""by Karl Urban.

It is very rare - preciously rare - that a big-budget franchise employs first class effects, compelling sound, and 3 strong Acts all in the service of character-driven storytelling. ""Star Trek"" is that rarity. This is Star Trek as space opera, big and adventurous, and is only given proper justice by seeing it in hi-def!"
1761,5.0,"It's not like you were worried it might be a substandard Blu-ray release with poor video or audio quality, not in a big-budget effects-heavy J.J. Abrams movie made recently.  They were planning the Blu-ray during filming, you know it.

The bonus stuff is pretty good too -- Abrams is always fun to watch behind the scenes because he looks like how we, the fans, would probably be on the set, occasionally so overwhelmed by how freaking cool it is to be there and how cool is everything going on, that the enthusiasm is infectious."
1762,3.0,"The acting is great. The set is awesome. The ghosts are freaking creepy as is that house. But something was missing. There was shock and horror, but there was little connection between the characters. I think the directing was too fast, the actors weren't allowed to find the heart of their characters. And I get that the music was supposed to be some kind of throw back to Gothic drama, but it really overpowered everything else with it's over-the-top cheesiness. Also, I was thrown when the male lead gave Mr. Rochester's speech from Jane Eyre. Was it supposed to be clever, to say that speech to the actress who played Jane Eyre? It completely distracted me from what was happening in the scene. Although, it occurs to me now that might have been deliberate, to highlight how phony he was.. OK, that is kind of clever.

Overall, I think the female lead was poorly written. The actress gave it her best, and she is very good, but she had too little to work with. She seldom reacted to things like a real person would. Coughing up blood? Huh. Weird wells full of blood-colored goop in the basement, with metal covers locked over them? The English and their peculiar ways. And though the house is fun, it goes beyond realistic. Especially her reaction to it. Which was basically no reaction. A missing roof? Blood colored stains on all the walls, rotting and dilapidated objects all over the place? For a woman of her up-bringing? Whatever. It's fine. Look, a dog!

I believe this movie is a victim of the current poor writing trend. Apparently Hollywood is spending all of it's money on actors and special effects, and there is no money left over to hire a decent script writer. At least it's not a remake."
1763,3.0,"Wow and wow. Disney certainly doesn't restrain itself on this one. This movie plays out more like a Disney parody than an actual film. John Smith is a tall Prince Charming type with flowing blond hair, a commanding voice and the bravery of ten men but nothing beats the introduction of Pocahontas. The camera pans up to her standing in a dramatic pose on a rocky outcrop overlooking the land while the wind whips colorful leaves around her. Since she's Native American she can literally talk to the animals including her raccoon friend, Meeko. A girl in a canoe calls to her and I'm thinking, ""she's definitely going to dive the football field length down into the lake"". To my surprise she turns to run down the mountain... before doubling back and doing a flawless dive into the lake. OF COURSE John Smith and Pocahontas will end up together; they are both perfect. It's not enough for Pocahontas to commune with the animals, she literally talks to the trees and they talk back... with faces. Oh, is that not enough for you? She also gets messages from the wind. Still not convinced Pocahontas is perfection? She is able to learn English instantly, no explanation given. She even understands terms she couldn't possibly have any frame of reference for understanding. Rocks and bushes glow at her touch, raccoons braid her hair and she's able to ride on the wind.

Pocahontas is hundreds of years of white guilt drawn up into one flawless Native American princess. It's is an 81 minute exaltation to the Disney Pocahontas; the Reductio Ad Absurdum of ""Disney Magic"". The actual Pocahontas died in her early 20's married to a tobacco planter named John Rolfe. There is a wisp of a story, a villain and some obnoxious animal sidekicks but they exist merely to complete the Disney formula and pad out the story. This is a story about how freaking AWESOME Native American's are and how only John Smith was worthy of being in their presence. Smith even manages to see the talking tree. There is a song near the end of the movie where the Native American's are shown to be as bigoted as the whites but I doubt the audience is fooled. The Native American's clearly have the moral superiority in this film.

So I hated the movie, correct? Actually no. Pocahontas is such a parody in and of itself that you can just bask in its unapologetic unrestrained self indulgence. Like Superman or Mickey Mouse, Pocahontas the character has no depth and no personal conflict but there can be a certain joy and simplicity in such unimpeachable goodness. She isn't a human she's an archetype of female strength and kindness. When her friend Nakoma confesses that she sent Kocoum to save her leading to his death Pocahontas never ever for a fraction of a second blames Nakoma. She is simply beyond human flaws. If you want to be awash in everything that people love and hate about Disney this is the movie to see.

Financially Pocahontas was a huge success and it has two really good songs but critically it was pretty middle of the road. I really didn't have a problem with any of the voice acting and somehow through the whole film I never picked up on the fact that Smith was voiced by Mel Gibson. Smith's friend Thomas was voiced by a young Christian Bale. To Disney's credit they showed a shocking burst of historical accuracy by having Pocahontas NOT end up with John Smith and in the sequel she correctly ends up with John Rolfe. Pocahontas is sort of a turning point where Disney reached its extreme before pulling back. After this movie Disney started slowly but surely changing the formula culminating in some wonderful films like The Emperor's New Groove and Lilo & Stich. These films were more highly acclaimed but less successful financially. So what is the lesson here? No idea other than Disney sadly learned from the latter two films to avoid experimentation."
1764,3.0,"Vastly successful entrepreneur suddenly finds herself down and out; incarcerated for 5 months for insider trading she finds herself homeless ..and her problems really begin right there . And for the viewer as well . No shelter , no employment, no freaking parole officer ? Would have made a cool character .the actor who played kristins sort of boyfriend should have played a parole officer whose head is left spinning by the hyper energetic Melissa .
The movie has liveliness to it , and the slapstick situations actually work .dialogue is clever and funny throughout albeit overloaded w swearing and sex blather - very off putting and disturbing as so much if the movie involves children .sign of the times, yeah yeah yeah .
Will the hardened self absorbed Melissa be softened , civilized by a loving family? See the movie on a Friday night ."
1765,5.0,"I just watched this movie yesterday and if you have ever wondered whether Ultra 4k HDR  or Dolby Vision/Dolby Atmos is a gimmick I can say unequivocally it is not!  Yes Ultra 4k is higher resolution than HD (1920x1080) but if your TV is 50 inches or less it may not be noticeable.  Where this technology really comes into it's own is with very large screen TV's.  Higher resolution is nice but where these movies really excel is when you couple that higher resolution with a broader range of colors.  HDR and Dolby vision add a whole new dimension to the cinema viewing experience.  Not only are the colors freaking awesome but the sound tracks in this movie will rock your world.  You really need a 5.1 or 7.1 speaker system layout to fully appreciate it.  This movie makes fantastic use of bass so if you have a sub-woofer prepare to be amazed!  The acting is fantastic from everyone.  Matt Damon is the star of course but Sean Bean, Jessica Chastain and all the other actors just hit it out of the park.  The plot is fantastic and interesting and the imagery is just gorgeous.  So why did I give it 4 stars?  Well at the very end I noticed that the audio dialogue became out of sync with the video.  Not by a whole lot but noticeable.  I can't really fault the movie or the encoding for sure because I have an A/V Receiver in between my OPPO UDP-203 player and my Sony HDR TV.  It could be the A/V receiver or it could be some buggy software in the OPPO player or finally it could be caused by defects in the encoding on the disk.  I am not sure which is the problem but I will give the vendor of the benefit of the doubt and most likely blame my OPPO UDP-203 blue ray player.  It would not be the first time I've had a problem with an OPPO player.  The audio problems at the end notwithstanding the movie is a joy to watch and should definitely be part of your collection.
------------
I am changing the review and giving the movie 5 stars.  I just watched the end of the 4k disk again and this time the audio and video were in perfect sync.  My experience with the first viewing of the film was probably due to a glitch in the OPPO player software.  Anyway I wanted to make sure I updated the review because it would not be fair to the studios who produced such an excellent product.  You can buy this movie with confidence.  For 15-17 USD this movie represents really good value for the money."
1766,1.0,"I really liked Blue Ruin and felt that it had some purpose and character to it, unlike Green Room which was pretty disappointing. This was little more than a gore fest. And I don't mind violence when it has it's place but this trades thrills and scares in for gore.

*There will be minor spoilers.* The plot is a straight up mess. It starts out fine, but this whole idea that Anton Yelchin's character would immediately start freaking out and call the police in front of a bunch of people who obviously don't want him to call the police is absurd. They know they're in a bad place, it's no secret that it's a place full of questionable people and yet he's losing his cool so quickly when all he has to do is remain calm and tell them he didn't see anything. All he has to do is stop and think for a minute and explain himself but instead he listens to the girl who he doesn't know and she asks him to call 911. Why? After all he was the only one who went in the room and he could've persuaded them to let him walk and then if he really wanted to he could've later phoned the police. Instead he loses his cool in front of the bad people who are now very upset and angry that he just called the police. The whole thing is absurd and doesn't make sense.

And the fact that there's dozens of skinheads around but they can't take on five people locked in a room is ridiculous. There's no way any of them would've survived long enough to arm themselves and make themselves look like Johnny freaking Rambo and kill all the bad guys. You're telling me dozens of these psychos who are clearly not opposed to violence can't take on five people who are way in over their heads. They barely know how to use a weapon and yet these skinheads who are no strangers to killing are unable to easily defeat them? Plus they're on the skinheads' turf. All of them should be eaten by dogs, diced up, and shot full of holes in minutes, maybe an hour tops. And that does happen to some of them but the fact that any of them would survive is absurd. And we're supposed to believe that a guy who's arm is so mangled (he should be in so much pain and not even be walking after awhile), and a woman are able to overpower multiple fully armed and strong neo Nazis. Wouldn't happen. Its almost as if the neo Nazis let them win because they make stupid decisions and don't appear to know what they're doing. So it's one of those movies where if dumb things don't happen then there's no movie, so I guess you just have to accept that. I had a very hard time buying it though.

I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say this movie has a lot of twists and turns, this was fairly standard and predictable. I also wasn't impressed with the performance of most of the leads. Patrick Stewart was completely wasted and Anton Yelchin was just mumbly and unconvincing. I don't know, didn't enjoy this like I thought I would. The plot didn't make a whole lot of sense but I would be able to forgive that if it was at least exciting, this was seriously lacking in tension. Usually a movie like this doesn't need a strong plot or characters, but this was even lacking in basic things that make a good thriller or horror movie. I wouldn't recommend it, watch Blue Ruin instead if you want a more original and interesting movie."
1767,1.0,"Finally watched this movie and it PISSES ME OFF--this guy is a freaking idiot to throw away his life when he has so much to live for!  This belittles my friends and students who live in wheelchairs and spend every day trying to live their lives with joy and strength despite their huge struggles!  Boo, hiss to this storyline!  What a dumb way to end this story!  I do not recommend this for anyone!"
1768,4.0,"The Sasha Banks & Bayley vs. Charlotte & Dana Brooke tag match was a good tag match. Both faces were getting worked on for a few minutes, then when Banks got that hot tag she was on fire. The finish with Charlotte tapping out sets up the obvious Banks vs. Charlotte match at SummerSlam that we have been expecting since WrestleMania. Thats where Banks should win the Womens Title. As for Bayley, it sounded like she won't be on the main roster full time after this because JBL said it was a one time thing from his sources. Im not sure how they are going to explain it. Im just glad Bayley was a part of it and the crowd reacted to her in a big way. That was awesome to see. Shell probably be on the main roster post SummerSlam. The The New Day (Xavier Woods, Big E & Kofi Kingston) vs. The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Erick Rowan & Braun Strowman) 6 man tag match was a slow match in the first five minutes and then the pace really picked up. My prediction was the Wyatt Family winning because I thought Wyatt should look strong going into his role as a Smackdown guy because hes a top two heel on that brand. Woods was awesome in the match. He isn't always booked strongly, but he did well here. Who cares if he got pinned? The crowd loved him. Wyatt was able to outsmart him for the finish, though. I hope Big Es okay after that bump outside the ring. He may be told to stop doing that spear to the floor bump because it could hurt him or somebody else some day soon. Also, it was noticeable that Strowman barely did anything in the match. I thought they might have him stand out more, but he really didn't do much. The United States Title: Rusev (w/Lana) vs. Zack Ryder was a basic match to put over the US Champion. I didn't see Ryder having much of a shot. He actually hit all of his big moves, but didn't go for the pin after the Rough Ryder. Instead, he went for the elbow drop off the top, Rusev blocked it and finished it two moves later. I like the way that Rusev has been booked in the last few months. He should be a force on the Raw brand going forward. The Sami Zayn vs. Kevin Owens match was an incredible match. What a performance by both Zayn and Owens. The crowd was really into it. It was better than their Payback match was and that was a lot of fun to watch too. There were big spots in the match like the brainbuster on the apron. Zayns fall during the springboard moonsault attempt looked bad, but Im glad Zayn was able to get through the match. I know some people think they do this match too much and maybe thats true, but when its as good as this match was how can you complain? I definitely wont. They are two of the best in-ring performers with incredible chemistry. How many standing ovations do you see during a match? Doesnt happen often. One of the best matches of the year  probably #2 right now. I think Nakamura vs. Zayn in Dallas was still the best WWE match this year, though. The Natalya vs. Becky Lynch match had good story in the match with Natalya working on the knee for the entire match. I figured she would win, but I thought she would cheat more for it. She really didn't cheat other than that kick to the knee when the ref was backing up Lynch. I thought Lynch did a good job of showing babyface heart as she always does. As for the crowd, they weren't into it that much because of how good Zayn/Owens was before it. Im glad they got more than five minutes, though. At least it gives them a shot to tell a story, which they did. This feud will likely continue on the Smackdown brand. The Intercontinental Title: The Miz (w/Maryse) vs. Darren Young (w/Bob Backlund) was a below average match. They just didn't really have much of a flow to it and nothing interesting happened until Backlund was freaking out on the floor. Im not even sure what the finish was because they never announced anything. Miz is on Smackdown and Young is on Raw, so I guess thats the end of this storyline. Weird way to end it. The John Cena, Enzo Amore & Big Cass vs. AJ Styles, Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson 6 man tag match was a really good tag match for the most part. I liked the energy of the match as they did some big spots towards the end of it. It was a bit weird near the end when Cena and Styles were outside the ring for more than a minute, yet the ref was in the ring watching the other guys battle it out even though they shouldnt have even been in there. The announcers tried to cover for the ref saying he was just letting the guys fight, but its a bit sloppy. Cena getting the pin on Styles was done to set up the rematch at SummerSlam. Fine with me. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship: Dean Ambrose vs. Seth Rollins vs. Roman Reigns was a very good triple threat match. Considering it was the first time they had a three way match (on the main roster) they told an awesome story. It started out with Rollins getting in a lot of offense, then Reigns got going and dominated with his power. I liked the part where Rollins and Ambrose worked together to drive Reigns through the table. The crowd loved it too. The finish was set up pretty well because it was all about Roman and Seth battling eachother, then Roman hit his finish and Ambrose was right there to hit Roman with his finish to win the match. Smart booking for the champion Ambrose. I picked Rollins to win, but I don't mind Ambrose carrying the title. Reigns taking the pin was the obvious choice. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10."
1769,3.0,"As an on-again, off-again follower of the Vertigo comic this is based upon, I was all geared up to hate it mightily before it had even spun up in the DVD player. With that said, it fares somewhat better than I'd expected. It isn't a raging success story, but it's not a tragic insult to the rich, lengthy source material either. Keanu Reeves is a horrible choice for the lead, no doubt about that - where the funny book Constantine is a complex, witty, bitter but charismatic subculture hero, Keanu's interpretation is as nuanced as a bag of bricks. I don't know how much I can fault the actor for that - after all, he's been playing dress-up with the same character for two decades now - but regardless of where the blame lies, he lacks the unspoken authenticity that role needs to get off the ground. Fortunately, the blow is softened somewhat by a dynamite intro sequence that may as well have been ripped straight from the pages of the comic and a decent, if indulgent, central storyline. With a full-blown war between heaven and hell at its core, it would've been very easy to get overly adventurous with the film's scope, but it wisely maintains a short focal range and that keeps things mostly grounded. It won't be finding a home on anyone's top ten list, and it's not easy to look past Keanu being Keanu (with Shia freaking LaBeouf crammed in as a throwaway sidekick), but the tone is right and the special effects work is a grand success. Not nearly what it could've been, but also not what I feared it would become."

1772,2.0,"I remembered seeing this when I was younger and really freaking out over the carousel scene where the parents are in the bed all hot for each other. I mean, really HOT. Flaming hot in fact. That scared the (blank) out of me!

Now that I am no longer a wee lad, but am a bit older and wiser, I watched this movie with great interest. One word: ""Huh?"" This is the freakiest movie ever. And I don't mean that in a good way. It is Dumb with a capital D. Brad Dourif is weird, man. It freaks me out to even look at the guy. And the story is really lame. A psychic radio show guy gets set on fire through the phone. Sam's mentor turnes out to be an EVIL MADMAN who is trying to set him up with his sister/girlfriend Lisa so that together they will breed and create the ULTIMATE SECRET GOVERNMENT WEAPON so that this crazy guy can have THE ULTIMATE POWER. Uh, sorry. You kind of lost me back there somewhere...

The ending is... uh, funky. Some bad special effects with a memorable last line: ""Lisa, I can take your fire."" Then the movie just ends. What? It just stops. Like, ""Okay that's it. You can all go home now. Sorry for wasting your time.""

This movie would have had a great theme song if they had used The Doors' ""Light My Fire"". I can definitely see telling Cynthia Bain to ""Come on baby light my fire."" I give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because... well I'm not sure why really. I guess I just like to witness Brad Dourif's flame-sprouting dementia."
1773,5.0,"Only one night after witnessing the hilarious&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Street-Fighters/dp/B00005QJJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A. Street Fighters</a>&nbsp;Sid stumbled upon fantastic b gold yet again. The very same channel offered up a fine dose of Sci-fi b from 1988 called Arena. After hitting the info button we knew this one had to be unreal just from the 2 sentence synopsis. Usually we wind up more in the action or horror B genre but have always welcomed a Science fiction entry, especially once we saw it was produced by Charles Band prior to him launching Full Moon. If that wasn't enough we then realized the main character looked very familiar and found out it was the Deke from Creepshow 2! Hey Pancho! That's one of Sid's favorites and will go down as once of the greatest spots yet to date.

In Arena we find ourselves somewhere far into the future, despite it's got 80's written all over it, where elite fighters from every planet battle in the ring in hopes of becoming the B champion of the universe. For a quite some time no earthling had been good enough to be a contender until Creepshow 2 Alumni Steve Armstrong comes along. He winds up getting himself into a mess and has to take on only the best and cheaply made alien creatures or an alien mafiosa will have to take him out. He becomes an underdog on the rise, much like Rocky Balboa, only with far less of a budget and an insane amount of more laughs.

Arena was easily a 5 star event from premise and budget alone. This is one of those gems that is so cheaply made and hilariously acted that you have no choice but to love it. That is unless you're some stuffy overly serious movie watcher that can't find the beauty in a great piece of B cinema. As long as you're going into it with the right expectations you will freaking love it. We suggest you get some of your favorite munchies, a nice substance of choice, and sit back for an hour an a half of laughs coupled with WTF moments. And don't forget to really take in the award winning performance by mighty Earthling warlord Steve Armstrong, or as we like to remember him as Pancho."
1774,5.0,This movie was so freaking funny! More so than I even expected. I already love Hear No Evil See No Evil and Silver Streak. This one rates right up there with those . Gene Wilders character mixed with Richard is a perfect duo .
1775,2.0,"The real demon is this movie.  Plodding, unconnected incidents, nonsensical connections.  I fell asleep somewhere in the middle, and woke up to find the siblings doing the same things I had been watching them do when I fell asleep.  They are imprisoned in their home, they escape from their rooms, they are caught, they are imprisoned in their rooms, they escape from their rooms, they are caught, they are imprisoned in their rooms, yada yada yada.  There's the cliche' intense doctor with a scheme for a ""blood cure"", there's the tinge of insanity, breeding with a town virgin with her ""pure blood"" to end a curse, a brother and sister who kiss once or twice, the sister meets a studious guy in the woods, they have sex, she is caught and taken to her room, he reappears later to rescue her...why?  The villagers have some fun freaking out the village priest with some pagan strawman burning ritual.  This could go on for an hour and 26 minutes...oh wait, it does.
Worst Hammer Film I've ever seen.  In their earlier days, before buying rights to monster stories, they made some really really intensely great films, collected into ""The Icons of Suspense Collection"" - ""Stop Me Before I Kill"", ""Maniac"", ""The Snorkel"", ""These Are The Damned"" (really excellent), and ""Never Take Candy From A Stranger"" - a film about a pedophile back in the days when the victims weren't supposed to report such things - really heartbreaking, full of tension, all well-acted films.  Too bad Amazon Instant Video doesn't offer these!"
1776,5.0,"There are plenty of things that films, especially older films can do to portray various aspects of the lives of people who have inhabited this wicked old world. The film under review, Max Ophuls The Earrings of Madame de is almost a perfect expression of the Belle Epoque, the period of peace and stability for the upper crust before the ugly storm of World War I washed away all such illusions that the industrial age would bring unencumbered  progress and benefits to the Western world. To show rather graphically how the ill-thought out consequences of the moral decay of the period would bring the flower of the European youth to its knees before that conflict was over. At another level this film, for those who want to shy away from the political storms, represents an exceptional example of a master filmmaker at work using one simple thread to tell his story, to tell of the consequences of what the headline to this review points out-when you first practice to deceive-watch out for the blowback.

For those who want to accept the film for its latter view here is how things came to such a nasty personal end. Madame de (and the beauty of this film other than as an example of the decadent French aristocracy is we never learn, never need to learn really the rest of Madames surname-a brilliant stroke), played by Daniele Darrieux, a big star of the French cinema in the post-World War II period, a flighty and self-indulgent wife of a count and General in the French Army, played by Charles Boyer, in the post-Paris Commune period was in hock up to her pretty eyebrows to a party (or parties) unknown. To get out from under dear Madame had hocked an expensive pair of earrings that the good General had given her as a heartfelt wedding gift. From there it is a question of following the bouncing ball, following the trail of the earrings and what they mean to the receivers in various contexts.

Obviously to Madame they did not mean much in that stage of her marriage (she had plenty of other hock-able goods around her boudoir)  since she hocked them and then made up an outrageous story about losing them at the opera. Wrong move. Once the theft became public the jeweler who Madame hocked the jewels to got cold feet and sold them to the stiff upper-lipped general a second time. The General, in turn, used them as bait in his rush to get rid of an inconvenient mistress that he had tired of whom he was sending off to Turkey. She, in turn, hocked then when she got in over her head in gambling debts in some Kasbah casino. They were subsequently purchased by a Baron, played by Vittorio DeSica, who was on the way to Paris to take up a diplomatic post. Are you still with me?

This is where things got dicey. The Baron met and was enchanted by Madame who used every coquettish trick in the book to entice him, and to discard him like an old shoe. Eventually they do become lovers and as a token of that love the kindly Baron gives Madame, you guessed it, the earrings. Problem: she cant wear the things as a sign of her love for the Baron since the game would be up with the General. So the hair-brained Madame finds the missing jewels. Oops. The general already suspicious took the found jewels from Madame and confronted the Baron with the truth of Madames lies. Get this though. He wanted the Baron to sell them to the now obviously seriously wealthy jeweler so he could buy them a third time and present them yet again to Madame. Meanwhile the Baron seeing what the real picture was bowed, out of the scene. All very civilized, civilized indeed.

Done, right. Are you kidding. The irate General gave them to Madame but told her to give them to a niece who has just given birth to a child. She, the niece, in turn, sold those freaking earrings to the now over the top rich jeweler to pay off hubbys debts. The reckless if wealthy jeweler tried to sell them to the General a fourth time but he balked on this one. Madame stepped up to purchase them though after hocking some goods that she could have hocked to begin with. That purchase, that final purchase (at least in the film) was the tripping point for the General knowing that Madame was purchasing the jewels back out of devotion to the Baron. The General decided to confront the Baron with his indiscretions with Madame, with his wife. Such matters of honor were then settled in a very civilized way-divorce court. No, no on the field of honor among gentlemen-a duel. The Baron was doomed but would not back down. As a token trying to save the Baron through some miracle Madame placed the earring as a donation at her church. No go. The Baron caught the westbound train, was killed by the Generals single well-placed bullet. Madame, well, Madame, began to fall apart as usual when any slight or grand thing laid her low. A great film which you really must watch when you get a chance. And remember the moral too."
1777,5.0,Vengeance Is Mine is the true story of a serial killer in Japan and is outstanding on many levels. The performance of the lead is inspired! The choices the actor makes to showcase every single part of the characters warped personality are done with complexity. And then the intimacy in which the film is filmed is disturbing and real. We get that this man is a complete person and we get he is very disturbed and we are with him the whole time; not on his side but in his mind without totally freaking out!  Filmmaker and Actor are one in this film and it's quite an accomplishment!
1778,5.0,"So I grew up during this time but for some reason never watched this when it came out even though I had a huge crush on Alicia Silverstone having watched The Crush and the Aerosmith videos, think I just thought it was a chick flick or something and none of my high school guy friends ever showed interest in seeing it.  Was in 10th grade when this came out.

ANYWAY, fast forward to me being almost 40 and I finally watched it - wow it's freaking great.  Not a chick flick at all, it's super funny actually and just really uplifting and likeable.  Like it put me in a good mood when I watched it and have watched it more than once now and always in a good mood during and after.  Plus I mean it's easy to look at Alicia for an hour and a half good grief talk about a gorgeous chick."
1779,3.0,"The use of gimmicks in promoting low budget, low grade films used to be more common in the past, the grand master of such techniques being William Castle, probably his most famous being the attaching of vibrating devices to the bottom of various seats within the theater, then activating said device at specific moments during the showing of his film The Tingler (1959), scaring the heck out of movie going patrons.  The purpose of these techniques was to provide an extra incentive to get the audience in the seats, using relatively inexpensive promotional tactics to prop up what was probably otherwise a weak film.  Sometimes these techniques worked very well, while some floundered miserably, as is the case of the use of `Psycho-Rama', which was basically the insertion of single picture frames within the film, known as subliminal images, in Terror in the Haunted House aka My World Dies Screaming (1958).  Directed by former actor Harold Daniels (Bayou, House of the Black Death), the film stars Cathy O'Donnell (The Amazing Mr. X, Ben-Hur), Gerald Mohr (The Angry Red Planet), William Ching (D.O.A.), and somewhat recognizable character actor John Qualen (The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, 7 Faces of Dr. Lao).

As the film begins, we learn Shelia (O'Donnell), living in Switzerland and recently married to Philip (Mohr), is having nightmares that are actually the re-emergence of a repressed event that occurred during Shelia's childhood.  The nightmares feature a creepy house and always end at the same point, right before what was probably a traumatic event.  Anyway, Philip and Shelia decide to return to the states (both were originally American citizens), and Philip, deciding Shelia needs time to rest, rents a remote house that shares a remarkable resemblance to the house in Shelia's dream, to which Shelia begins freaking out, but Philips seems curiously insistent that they stay, hoping to force Shelia to face her demons, thereby overcoming them, or so he says...well, even if they wanted to leave, they can't as someone keeps stealing the distributor cap from their car (damnable kids).  Soon others begin to get in on the act, like Jonah (Qualen), the bugged-eyed, mentally defective caretaker, and Mark (Ching), the apparent owner of the old house (he doesn't live there, as he says it's too old and dilapidated for anyone to stay there, except, I guess Jonah, and the house does have a disturbing history).  As the spookiness sets in (faces in the window, screams piercing the night, etc.), Sheila's fractured mind begins the slow process of piecing together memories once thought lost, but it may be too late to learn what really happened so long ago as she's certain death awaits her in the haunted house, and she may be right...

Terror at the Haunted House was actually better than I expected, but not great by any means.  The story, what I would term as a psychological melodrama thriller, kept me interested through to the end (I did feel the final payoff a bit weak).  The mystery is well preserved throughout, although some of the exposition did appear obvious and awkward (i.e. clunky).  The pacing was relatively solid, slowing down a few times, but the tension was apparent.  I thought one of the best parts was at the beginning, as O'Donnell's character was relating her dream, and we walked through it via POV shots of the house.  This sequence was genuinely creepy and set up the rest of the story nicely.  The acting was decent, nothing spectacular, but I did like Cathy O'Donnell (who I believe sounds a little like Mia Farrow) as she displayed a demure attractiveness (and spent a good deal of the film in her nightgown) and presented her character reasonably well.  I also liked John Qualen as the nutty caretaker, I suppose because I have a soft spot in my heart for curmudgeonly, codgerly old coots on the screen, a few of my favorites being Walter Huston (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre), Edmond O'Brien (The Wild Bunch), and the comical representation of Gabby Johnson, played by Jack Starrett, in Mel Brook's film Blazing Saddles.  Qualen may not have been as curmudgeonly or codgerly as these latter characters (and this wasn't a westerner, as is the case of those other films), but he was pretty kooky, and the assumption within the film regarding the cause of his condition was living alone for much too long.  As far as the `Psycho-Rama' element, or use of subliminal images (here they were odd cartoon still frames inserted at certain tense moments of the film), it was pretty annoying.  You could tell something interrupts the movie, and use of the pause and frame advance feature on your DVD player will display these images, if your interested, and, thankfully, it didn't happen often.  As someone else mentioned, Rhino, the company that released this film to DVD, took the liberty of inserting one of their own messages, one that features a crude, red cobra head (the originals were all in black and white), along with text that relates the message that you should rent Rhino videos everyday.  I took this as I think it was intended, as a minor, playful adulteration of the original film, but it is an adulteration nonetheless, and something movie fans don't care for...also, the Internet Movie Database lists the running time of this film as 85 minutes, while this release is only 77 minutes.  Is there truly an extra 8 minutes of footage out there?  The film seemed pretty complete, so maybe it involved some lengthy pre-movie footage detailing what exactly `Psycho-Rama' was...I've seen this done on other films utilizing gimmicks.  Regardless, the movie is decent and contains a few chills, even despite the `Psycho-Rama'.  The picture quality on this DVD is pretty good, as is the audio.  There are no special features available, but there are chapter stops.

1780,1.0,"Honestly, $300.00 for a VHS tape.  Are u people out of your mind's?  Who in the freaking world would pay $300.00 for a brand new VHS tape?  That's all I have to say about that.  Just stop being stupid and charging such outlandish prices for something that is slowly being phased out anyway."
1781,5.0,"Evil Ed is that horror film that Ive always been meaning to watch ever since seeing the poster of a Steven Weber lookalike going crazy. It always sat at the back of my horror mind, teasing me to seek it out and watch it, yet I never did. Having said that, you can only guess at how delighted I was when Arrow Video announced their May lineup and what do you know, Evil Ed is coming to Blu-ray! Finally, I exclaimed! I can now watch this movie.

Well, I finally did watch the movie, and even though the film is poorly acted, the love that the creators have for horror films is very much evident on the screen. Each scene is littered with nods to other horror films (honestly, better horror films) and the special effects are fantastic for a film that was shot for an estimated $29,000 (unconfirmed). I cant stress enough that this movie is not meant to be taken seriously, not in the least bit. You also have to forgive the flicks jumbled mess of a story as well. If you can get past all that, youll realise you're in for a pretty fun treat.

REVIEW

The story for Evil Ed goes a bit like this. Edward is a tasked with editing the violent series Loose Limbs for distribution in markets where gore, nudity and violence are prohibited. Edward has to sit through countless hours of extreme footage, which eventually drives him insane. He starts to imagine monsters coming after him, or creatures living in his fridge telling him off. Eventually, Edward images that a creature tells him to cleanse the world of bad people and he starts with the people close to him.

Thats the gist of Evil Ed. There is more to it than that, as the film has a tendency to change things up each act. Viewers will probably find this weird story telling jilted, as the film has several moments where it could end, yet keeps going. Its pretty easy to tell that the movie was shot over five years, as it feels like there are three or four ideas in this film wanting to be told.

Nevertheless, the mishmash of story ideas gives the makers a chance to really cram in some crazy horror, gore and bits of comedy, giving a big middle finger to Swedens pre-1996 policy of censoring anything that had scenes of sex or violence. Evil Ed is one film that should not be taken seriously, or else youll never get past the terrible acting and dialogue.

The Arrow Video Blu-ray for Evil Ed includes the extended cut of the film, along with the shorter original cut. I watched the extended cut myself and went through the other cut to see the differences, and besides a couple of scenes, one that extends the fight scene near the third act, the two cuts are relatively the same. Whichever version you watch, youll be the getting the same film. Each cut has been cleaned up rather nicely, and even though the film is really low budget, the HD upgrade helps make the film look the best it ever has. The same goes for the stereo and 5.1 audio options. That menu music really pumps through your speakers nicely.

Given the history of the films trouble making, the special features are packed full of interviews and an extensive three-hour making-of. They dive into the issues that came up, and you can tell that the people behind the film really loved what they were doing. Of course, youll need to love the movie yourself to want to go through everything, as youll be hours. There are deleted scenes, a few hidden easter egg features on the first disc, a fun introduction, that crazy long making-of on the third disc and even more! Seriously, this Limited Edition is freaking packed full of goodies.

VERDICT

I really enjoyed Evil Ed, terrible acting and disjointed storytelling and all. The film is a love letter to horror fans, in which they provide you with ample amounts of gore, amazing special effects and some nudity to please the horny crowd (proud member right here). If you enjoy your horror loaded with cheese, youll get a huge kick out of Evil Ed, and the Arrow Blu-ray Limited Edition is going to keep your ass glued to your couch for hours."
1782,4.0,"The 90s are the new 80s and Detention wastes little time pointing this out to you. I had been looking forward to Detention for quite some time mostly because it looked so different. Unusual, original, unique; whatever you want to call it Detention is unlike anything else you've ever seen before.

Half high school comedy and half slasher horror, Detention manages to incorporate so much into its 89 minute duration. Grizzly Lake is your average town with typical high school students absolutely loathing the town they're in. The difference is that somebody is dressing up as Cinderhella; the latest slasher movie serial killer and killing students at Grizzly Lake high school. A group of students serving Saturday detention band together to not only survive, but figure out a way to still go to prom and maintain some normalcy for the remainder of their senior year.

The film begins as a narrative for the most popular girl in school Taylor Fisher (Alison Woods) before shifting gears and being the narrative for the least popular girl in school Riley Jones (Shanley Caswell). You get a Scott Pilgrim Vs the World vibe right off the bat. Visually, Detention is very bright, colorful, and vibrant. It was kind of bizarre seeing Josh Hutcherson in this. While his character of Clapton Davis isn't exactly a step in a different direction for his acting career, the film's content certainly is with all of its profanity, nudity, and graphic content. Dane Cook also seems to take a little too much pride in playing the smarmy Principal Verge.

The 90s references mostly lie within the Ione character (Spencer Locke). She's like a living, breathing version of VH1's ""I Love the 90s"" and is constantly talking about the greatest time period ever (her words, not mine). But Clapton's wardrobe looks like it came right out of that era's closet. The T-shirts he wears, the Bret ""The Hitman"" Hart sunglasses, the Converse All-Star sneakers, and the way he's always on a skateboard are the 90s personified. That's when Detention begins to shift gears again.

Somewhere along the line, Detention begins to reference Scream, Donnie Darko, The Fly, and even Back to the Future. Clapton could pass as Marty McFly's younger cousin, but there's this crazy time traveling concept thrown in there as well. Ione and her mom switch bodies and time periods like Freaky Friday and there's a freaking time traveling stuffed grizzly bear. Detention has the most movie references I've ever experienced in any one given film and somehow turns all of that into one of the most unpredictable movies ever.

Detention is pure insanity. It's visually compelling and progresses in such an unusual manner. It's like it jumps back and forth from being hilarious and really amazing to being this really wild and strange ride where you're just left wondering, ""What the @#$! is going on?!"" It's the type of film where you'll always find something new that you missed during a previous viewing and demands consistent revisits. Detention combines everything you love about everything and has the precise formula and ingredients of a true cult classic."
1783,2.0,"This episode didn't just make McNulty annoying to the other characters, they made him too annoying to the viewers too. It was the wrong choice of type of character for a plot such as a stopwatch that stops everyone and everything except the watch carrier. McNulty was too unlikable to make his adventures with the watch really enjoyable. Everyone at his job and his local bar couldn't stand him, because he was such an oblivious to the extreme nonstop motormouth.  He did not know the difference between getting noticed and getting liked and was too hard headed to listen to anybody but himself. McNulty was more blabbering and annoying than the chatterbox in TZ ep ""The silence"" who had to remain silent in a room for a year. It would've been better if they'd used McNulty for that episode and the chatterbox from there here. But better yet, I'm not sure why it was necessary at all to use an annoying blabbermouth for an episode about a watch that stops time. Actually, it holds up and distracts the story.
The watch itself idea was a great idea though, stopping time so the watch carrier can move around and psych out those around him such as others in the room being baffled on how a man can suddenly change from one side of the room to the other in a split second. That, and many great ideas that can be used with such a watch. This could've been a great episode. But not enough good ideas were executed well here. They showed us McNulty stopping the watch, moving, but then walking back to the same spot before pushing watch and resuming time. They did show us a split second move from one place to the other side of the room when it was just McNulty and the bartender, but even that was played more quick and dull then it could've been. Other ideas, such as McNulty stopping the watch and moving a base on the baseball field saving an out for the home team, they should've shown us that, not just have McNulty tell us. McNulty had received the magic watch from a friendly heavy accented bar customer, and the only character in this episode that liked him.
SPOILER BELOW
Then the bank robbing idea, instead of them showing us seeing if McNulty could really pull off and get away with robbing the bank, they instead showed us McNulty dropping and breaking the watch and McNulty now freaking out because he couldn't get people moving again. In McNulty's case though with what everyone thought of him, it's probably a good thing that he couldn't.
The watch breaking permanently idea and the outcome of everyone permanently frozen is actually a good one though, they just should've had that happen after we saw the outcome of McNulty robbing the bank.  The watch dropping and breaking bit had a sort of similarity to the Twilight episode ""Time enough at last"" when Burgus Meredith dropped and broke his glasses.
This episode's plot was also a bit of a reference to Twilight episode ""Elegy"" with someone's reactions to frozen unmoving people.
I kind of liked the part when McNulty first started freezing things and we see several different pictures of streets, cars, horses, etc. stopping frozen. I know that they were each stolen from previous films. One I recognized, the jet skiing picture, was taken from the Esther Williams film ""Easy to love"". I own that film and watched it numerous times."
1784,4.0,"This movie is old... and it shows... but the story is pretty good, even if the acting is a little strained. If you can toss aside the VERY early 80s/late 70s feel, it's a pretty good flick. The ending is a little... whatever, but I still liked it. My main focus was how cool the house is. Have you ever seen an octagonal house? I had not. I love that freaking house."
1785,5.0,"This film is still freaking me out. The title and content are killing me - wondering why a film with a girl who has an eye implant, which is not even a major point in the story - is called EYE of God .... what am I missing here or am I overthinking this one? I found the movie pretty good as far as everything else, but the title .... this Review is subject to future edit!"
1786,5.0,"I only wish this were available on DVD, because it's by far one of the best PH videos I've ever seen.  NO WAY you could call this tame unless you were expecting something it isn't... this is extremely explicit while still just being within soft core boundaries.  I have absolutely never seen anything in Penthouse video or print as hot as the two clips of Angelica Costello, her gorgeous face with beautiful lips and eyes and sexy raven hair, plus that body, OMG that body - more pear-shaped than most PH Pets and that curvy juicy pelvic region, and I can't even say what she does is pink so much as bright freaking RED!  Not just one little glimpse either - it's several sustained lingering spread open shots and one very big close-up where you can see The Canal as well.

Angelica's scene was so good that it took a while to realize there is a lot of other HOT action on this video - the other girls all do lots of pulling panties aside, lots of lingering pink shots and a few spreads, plus there are some girl-girl scenes that feature some mild mouth to labia contact and not-so-simulated 69.  In this context of the sensual production quality (camera work and music background) it has just the right amount of tease and actual satisfyingly explicit material.  And the voice overs from each Pet get pretty sexy as well, talking about what they like and I mean one of the ladies gets extremely graphic in her descriptions...

The only thing that I was barely able to detect here and there, is I think the girls probably did a few insertions that we weren't allowed to see.  I wouldn't want PH to start getting too garish or monotonous with explicit footage like that but if it happens once in a while, say a few seconds here and there of some real genuine meaningful stroking and a hidden finger, it would be nice if they left that in.  Again, I like staying on this side of the line between soft and hard, since I want the tease with a payoff, and not the payoff with no tease or sensuality or even production value (things that usually get discarded in hardcore).  But while we've got the gorgeous women and the sets and the nice lingerie and music and lighting, let's have the unrestrained passion too."
1787,4.0,"Just about every match in ""Backlash 2001"" is something you wouldn't ordinarily see on WWF TV back then, let alone today.  It's one of those events that throws everything at the wall to see what sticks.  The good news is that most of it works, making this 3 hours well spent.

1) The Dudleyz (Bubba Ray, D-Von, Spike) v.
X-Factor (X-Pac, Justin Credible, Albert)
---This opener was fairly by-the-numbers back in 2001, because these curtain jerkers are meant to get a crowd going more than anything else.  On that basis, this 6-Man Tag Team match still works.  The whole match moves along at a nice pace, and isn't boring at all.  That said, if you've followed some of the WWF's programming from 2000-2002, The Dudleyz' table gimmick was getting predictable by now (in my opinion, anyway).  But on the whole, the night gets off on a fun note; if not for you, it'll be over before you know it.
""6.5 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

2) Hardcore Championship
Rhyno (champion) v. Raven
---""OUCH"" is the key word here.  Man, these two just wail on each other with weapons, and cause almost as much harm to themselves when they fail to pull off a deadly attack.  Some could call this a ""garbage match"", meaning there's not much in the way of storytelling, and it's all about props and exciting action.  I have to admit that I used to love this match a lot more, but that was back when I wasn't into slower-paced technical wrestling.  Now I see two tough guys just beating each other senseless.  I still really like it, and commend the grueling effort, but have to admit that hard-hitting action is all this Hardcore Title bout is.
""7.5 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

3) Duchess of Queensbury Rules
William Regal (WWF Commissioner) v. Chris Jericho
---I love this whole storyline, honestly.  Jericho is going to compete in a match that only William Regal knows the rules!  That's is hilarious, in my book.  But all the ringside shenanigans aside, the match is just as crisp and balanced as their ""WrestleMania X-Seven"" opener.  It's easy to forget how great Regal used to be in his prime; Jericho, on the other hand, was always extremely talented.  I think this grudge match is a strong athletic matchup with some good comedy thrown in.
""8.0 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

4) 30-Minute Submission Match
Kurt Angle v. Chris Benoit
---The concept is simple but gutsy: The wrestler who can make his opponent submit (or ""tap out"") the most times will win the match.  I have to admit that I used to find this match very overrated when I was a younger viewer.  I loved both of these superstars, but just found this whole match to be slow.  But later in life, I rewatched this beloved classic, and realized just how difficult it was to execute, and how creative it really was.  It asks the audience to sit down, be patient, and pay attention to every single hold and maneuver.  After all, a submission score could happen at any moment.  I've watched this match many times, and am constantly amazed at how these two managed to pull it off, because there's very little in the way of striking or high-spots.  It's a pure grappling contest in the spirit of MMA, and I doubt anyone but Angle & Benoit could've delivered.  I will admit that around the 25-minute mark, I've had my fill of this Ultimate Submission Match.  Only when a few minutes remain do I sense any kind of stalling.  It's a small gripe, but I don't want to give the impression that this is a perfect match, by any means.  Frankly, this is one of the toughest matches to recommend because, from my point of view, it requires a particular audience.  But if you wanna see how tough these guys are, and want to watch a match that tests what kind of WWE fan you are, then sit back and watch it unfold.
""9.0 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

5) Last Man Standing Match
Big Show v. Shane McMahon (WCW Owner)
---I have to admit that as much as I admire Shane's courage and toughness, I enjoy very few of his matches (yes, the KOTR 2001 Street Fight is definitely a classic).  I kinda liked the storyline, where Vince McMahon is still bitter over losing at ""WrestleMania X-Seven"", not to mention the WCW contract (in the script, anyway).  I was enjoying myself when Shane was making a strong first impression, and finding creative ways to keep Big Show down.  But once Show gained the upper hand, this became a very boring match for me.  And when Test interferes, he basically does all the work, until Shane does a daredevil highspot that no man should attempt.  I guess if you're a Shane-O-Mac fan, or just wanna see Big Show beaten around, then this'll be a good one.  I personally got tired after awhile, and wasn't wowed enough when all was said and done.
""5.5 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

6) European Championship
Matt Hardy (champion) v. Christian v. Eddie Guerrero
---And the award for most random match goes to...THIS ONE!  I don't even think this title bout was advertised before the PPV began.  In all seriousness, this is a decent 3-way match with some neat spots and a breezy pace.  I just wish it didn't feel like it was thrown together at the last minute.  There's really just nothing to say about this match.  It's there.  It's fairly enjoyable.  It's over.  You don't remember a whole lot about it afterwards.
""6.5 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

7) Three Titles On The Line
Triple H (Intercontinental champion)
& 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin (WWF champion)
v. Kane & The Undertaker (Tag Team champions)
---The WWF used a similar concept at ""King of the Ring 2000"", but this time, every wrestler involved has something to gain and something to lose.  The storyline was bizarre but intriguing: Steve Austin joined forces with Vince McMahon AND Triple H, both of whom he had bad blood with.  Kane & Undertaker were apparently the only guys tough enough to take them on.  Once the match starts, it takes a while for HHH & Austin to gain any kind of momentum.  The Tag champs just stop them in their tracks time and again.  Eventually, the Austin/HHH combo managed to gain some advantages.  Like most main events from the Attitude Era, all hell broke loose, leading to a run-in or two, and a chaotic finish.  So, what did I think about this main event?  I liked what I saw, but I really wish we got more of a straight-up showdown where both teams looked impressive from the getgo.  I can't help but think that WWF really dropped the ball with a possible all-star atmosphere.  Instead, these men went for something a bit more challenging, and for the most part, it works.  The match is pretty lenghty, which sometimes makes it drag, other times give you the feel of an epic battle.  The match starts humorously, which is great because it's Austin & HHH getting tossed around, but is also annoying because it's freaking TRIPLE H AND STEVE AUSTIN!  I like this match, was satisfied with what I saw, and recommend it to those who haven't seen it.  I just think a much better match was possible if a different approach was taken.
""7.0 / 10""
-----------------------------------------

To call ""Backlash 2001"" my least favorite event of 2001 may seem like an insult, but it's really not.  2001 was a fantastic year for the WWF, and ""Backlash"" is a worthwhile PPV.  You get Hardcore action, a technical wrestling clinic, a couple throwaway crowd-pleasers, a comedy match, a David/Goliath fight, and a star-packed main event.  The WWF took a lot of chances with this PPV, which main explain why this PPV doesn't seem to gel together like the better WWF/WWE PPVs.  But then again, if it weren't for the risk-taking, we might not have been privileged to see such a diverse card."
1788,2.0,"I'm into the supernatural,and remember watching this around Halloween. I think they still show it, come the season.
The premise is the tale being retold, followed by 1st hand accounts of sightings, and other unusual findings. They return to the area in question, with cameras showing their faces throughout the venture. I'm not sure but I don't recall showing the suspected haunted area, and few noises, other than the explorers freaking out.
This show lacks depth, and somewhat motivation. They could have referenced old town records, and or historians of the affected area, and areas. Most of the talk here comes from teens, looking for excitement.
Adults unfortunately rarely take these adolescents seriously."
1789,5.0,"This is a freaking classic movie! In my opinion one of the best movie ever made! No action, no huge explosions in your face or gun fights, just a great ol story driven movie with great dialog. Be warned tho the entire movie is in Spanish. So make sure you have your Rosetta Stone ready"
1790,2.0,"I got this, based on the ""rave reviews"" everybody had.  Was so excited and hooked it up, set it up per the menu, popped corn, sat back, tunred off the lights and ""WTF?!?!?!"".  The picture was so blurry it gave me a screaming headache in ten minutes.  Sure there are some decent 3D effects here and there, but the picture quality is so god awful it made it tough wading through the rest of the movies to get to the ""good parts"".  I truly hope the new technology that is so freaking expensive is better and it damn well better be since I just dropped  afew grand on a widescreen setup and ma waiting for the glasses.

So, wait for my next review of the ""new"" 3D technology.  For an HONEST average guy opinion.

In this average guy's opinion, this one sucks.  Some nice effects, but an almost unwatchable picture.  I'd say wait for the next wave to catch on and prices come down a bit.....that or buy my setup like this one.  I'll sell it really cheap, ha ha ha."
1791,4.0,"Garden of the Dead is the epitome of incredibly low budget drive-thru horror cinema; this film is truly awful, which means I freaking loved it.  If you're going to make a stupid movie, I say go all the way, and that is exactly what these guys did (well, except for the nonexistent gore).  Of course, you can only do so much with a budget that consists of whatever money you could find in your pants pockets and between the cushions of your couch.  (There's only one police car to be seen, and the convicts' numbers are handwritten on their shirts.)  Is Garden of the Dead scary?  Of course not.  Zombies aren't scary to begin with, and who expects to be scared by a 1970s trailer park trash movie, anyway?

The story takes place at one of America's numerous formaldehyde-producing prison camps, somewhere in the middle of nowhere.  The warden dresses all in black (even wearing his black gloves to bed) and talks tough, but security is so lax that a bunch of the convicts have plenty of time to sniff tons of formaldehyde vapors and dig an escape tunnel for themselves.  Having rotted their brains of whatever smarts they might have had to begin with, the escapees quickly find themselves shot down and planted in shallow graves - but they don't stay there for long.  After all, there's more formaldehyde to be had back at the camp.  Along the way back, they scare the bejesus out of one ""good"" prisoner's reasonably hot girlfriend, but all of the axe-wielding, shotgun-blasting action is back at the prison camp.  Is it fierce and exciting?  No.  Is it fun to watch?  Absolutely.

You have to love these formaldehyde junky zombies.  The whole lot of them can't figure out how to get inside an RV, yet the first thing they do back at the prison camp is to cut the power and phone lines.  And get this!  Not only is Garden of the Dead loads of fun to watch, it's also educational.  Here's just one lesson I learned from watching this film: if you're the clumsy convict who tripped and fired the shot that alerted the guards to your gang's great escape, don't hand the group's only gun over to your buddies when you finally catch up to them.

I do need to inform you that this film lasts only 58 minutes.  In this case, though, a short running time is probably a good thing - since the print is so dark and dirty, and formaldehyde junkie zombie action is best taken in measured doses.  Here's the bottom line: if you love really stupid, low-budget 70s drive-in horror films, you'll enjoy Garden of the Dead; if you don't, you'll want to shoot yourself in the head about fifteen minutes into the action."
1792,5.0,"If I had my own private shrine honoring the all-time greatest producers of dirt-cheap, hilariously awful films, it would feature life-sized statues of two men: Conrad Brooks and Mark Pirro.  Pirro is a new discovery for me, although he seems to be something of a legend among bad movie lovers and aspiring low-budget filmmakers.  With no Hollywood contacts and almost no money, Pirro has made a career out of doing what he loves.  Even a film like this one, Curse of the Queerwolf, can turn a nice profit since it was produced with a budget of only ten thousand dollars.  I can't wait to get my hands on the other films in the Pirromount Pictures discography, especially&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nudist-Colony-of-the-Dead/dp/B00000K3B3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nudist Colony of the Dead</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deathrow-Gameshow/dp/6301005856/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deathrow Gameshow</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Polish-Vampire-in-Burbank-25-Anniversary-DVD/dp/B000JYW67C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Polish Vampire in Burbank - 25 Anniversary DVD</a>&nbsp;(Pirro's first claim to underground fame), and of course, the upcoming The God Complex.  Anybody who actually casts Conrad Brooks (still my pick for the best of the world's worst filmmakers) in his films is more than OK in my book.

Reviewing this film is going to be a challenge, as some of the terms in the film are likely to draw censor-happy eyes.  But here goes.  Larry Smallbut (Michael Palazzolo) is your typical American male.  He cares about his live-in girlfriend, but that doesn't stop him from ""working late"" each night - and by ""working late,"" I of course mean hitting the bars and strip joints with his best bud Richard Cheese (Kent Butler) and picking up loose women for meaningless sex.  Then comes a night when fate rises up to bite him in the rear end - actually, it's his date Paula (Cynthia Brownell) that bites him in the rear end - just before Larry discovers that she has parts that no woman has any business having underneath her nether garments.  But it gets worse.  Just as he starts freaking out about this most sickening of discoveries, a torch-bearing quartet of weirdoes arrive on the scene to tell him that Paula is something much more disturbing than a transvestite - she, er he, is a Dickanthrope or, if you will, a Queerwolf.  Since these men in black are following the monster in order to kill it, Larry keeps the whole bite business to himself.  Even when a gypsy woman identifies him as a Queerwolf by the pansy-gram on his palm and he begins having disturbing nightmares involving hillbillies, he refuses to believe any of it.  Until, that is, he changes during the night of the next full moon and wakes up the next morning in a sauna full of naked men smiling at him.

Finally convinced of his fate, Larry has few options.  He doesn't want to die, especially since the only way to kill a Queerwolf is to drive a silver sex toy up his wazoo, but he certainly doesn't want to live with this limp-handed curse, either - especially since there seems to be a full moon every single night in his world.  Can the power of John Wayne save him?  Is there a Fagxorcist in the house?  Or is Larry doomed to walk the moonlit nights in women's clothes and to spend his days walking funny until he's put out of his misery by the Queerwolf hunters?

Needless to say, Curse of the Queerwolf is as hilarious as it is politically incorrect.  Some feel that every viewer will feel insulted at some point, but I disagree, mainly because the film doesn't pretend to be anything more than what it is, an extremely low-budget, utterly inane horror comedy.  The plot itself is funny enough, but the real comedy lies in the details of the dialogue and characters.  For instance, two of the Queerwolf hunters carry their lit torches at all times, no matter what they are doing, and Larry's friend Richard proves to be even funnier than he is annoying.  Even the bad movie clichs somehow work every time.  How could I not give as hilariously bad a film as Curse of the Queerwolf five stars?  This is everything a low-budget, cheesy bad horror comedy should be - and so much more.  My fellow bad movie lovers, take my advice and never pass up a chance to see this hilarious film for yourselves."

1794,4.0,"This is a pretty enjoyable series overall.  This was the first anime show I ever saw (mostly by accident) on Adult Swim on the cartoon network.  It had action, adventure, and comedy and was really fun to watch.  These are three pretty good episodes, not the best but not the worst either.  The only reason I gave it for stars is because 1.) It's really too expensive for three 20 minute episodes.  and 2.) It will probably be the only dvd of the series I buy because it's too expensive and there will probably be like 200 dvds, if not more and 3.) It's too freaking expensive.
But if you want something that involves a present day girl from Japan being sucked down a well into Fuedal Japan times and fighting with a demon dog guy, a warrior girl, a lecherous monk, a fox guy who has a feminine voice, a flea man, and varius other weird people as they fight Naraku (sp?) and he's minions, and laugh as Kigome (sp?!) fights to survive in that world as well as her own, then well...at least check it out on Adult Swim before buying this extremely high priced dvds."

I laughed my head off more than I had in probably a long time at that time. But the fact is, this movie is 1 star quality, but 3 stars worthy in terms of being good for a laugh. But don't watch it alone, this is a movie that you need to watch a la Mystery Science Theater 3000 style with some friends. I lucked out having an entire theater to laugh along with.

Even if I had watched it recently I couldn't give a proper plot description because there's barely a plot to be had. Oh sure some kids escape a drug rehab clinic and there's some old man who's a religious nut, and a demon goat. The special effects guy was at the marathon and he said that they used a goat becuase they couldn't get a spider (how you go from goat to spider I have no idea) and towards the end of his speech I personally yelled at ""NEVER SHOW THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE!"" Later in the lobby some kid who was a couple years younger asked if I had ever made a movie or knew what went into making one and of course I said no; and he responded with how can I judge it. Of course I responded with ""Are you $#!++ing me?"" And while in my life so far I've only made two short films, I've also watched many many MANY making of features on DVD's so I do have a good idea what goes into making a movie. Some of my reviews on here poking fun of the more artsy films has made people comment that I should stick with Jackie Chan movies or something I guess not much of a thinking movie.

I love plenty of crazy and or artsy and or avant-garde movies. But that's if there is a real point to it, not just because is doing it to appear that way. The image of a the man with the goat head is crazy for sure, but it's not enough to sustain the film really. It's not a long movie i recall, but it feels longer than it should be because it is terribly slow. It's never a good sign when the movie starts off with every single credit appears before the movie. Some could argue that's because it's a throwback to older films, which is cool, but it seems more like it's because the editor knows that nobody is gonna wanna watch the end credits so they might as well get that over. There's a scene where a kid's face turns blue and I suppose that's because he's detoxing, hard to say. The special effects aren't bad, but at times they are just so random and stupid and don't fit in with the movie. The main kid will start making out with his girlfriend and then start to puke blood (seems to be a bit pre mature if you ask me). The audience was literally freaking out when they saw that the movie wasn't quite over after it faded to black and faded back in. Tahnkfully it was just a preview for his next movie or something.

But as said before, this is a fun movie to watch with friends becauase it's so over the top silly."
1796,5.0,"This is a set I've had for some time and have now wanted to comment on.  Boy oh boy, this is truly a must have for any Shawn fan as it has 7 of Shawn's truly most remarkable matches that are still talked about to this day.  The first match up is an AWA match from 1986 known as the ""New Year's Eve Bloodbath.""  It has Shawn and Marty Jannetty the Midnight Rockers against Buddy Rose and Doug Somers.  This is a great tag match!  Shawn, in this match showed just how tough and good he could be as he bled buckets during the match.  Good match.  The next one is the IC title Ladder match with Shawn vs Razor Ramon at Wrestlemania X.  This is a very good match that single handily put Shawn on the map!  It is still one of the greatest performances that the industry has ever seen.  Gorilla Monsoon even stated that this was the best match he had ever seen.  This match was awesome and set the standard for others to follow.  Up next is the Iron Man match for the world title with Bret and Shawn at Wrestlemania XII.  This is quite possibly the best technicial match of the 1990's.  These guys just leave it all hanging out in the ring.  The match is hold for hold and move for move and one of the most exciting matches I have seen.  Simply put:  This may have been Shawn's finest hour.  Up next was the No Holds Barred match for the world title at In Your House Good Friends Better Enemies as Shawn took on Diesel.  This match was wild and out of control.  There are tables being used chairs and even an artifical leg used during the match.  This was a decent match but these two have had better like their Wrestlemania XI match.  Following that is the world title match at In Your House Mind Games between Shawn and Mankind.  Holy crap is this match freaking good.  I still say it was one of the most exciting title matches ever!  To me this is the match that made Shawn the ""showstopper.""  Mick has said that this match is either his favorite or 2nd favorite match in his career and after seeing it you can see why.  This match is good.  Up next is the first Hell in a Cell match with Shawn and the Undertaker.  This match to me is like watching a movie.  It starts slow and then builds and builds to a hell of a conclusion.  Much like the ladder match this one set the standard for the others to follow.  This match was off the chart good and bloody as hell as well.  This was one of the first times that we got to  see Shawn bleed in the WWE and boy did he!  Great match.  The last match is the return to action match he had at Summerslam 2002 when he took on Triple H in a non sanctioned match.  This match was very good as well.  After 4 years of retirement Shawn returns to the ring in all his glory!  This match does define what Shawn is:  ""The icon, the showstopper, the main event.""  Another 5 star match.  There are a ton of special features on this set as well that are worth the price of the DVD too.  All in all this is one very good DVD set."
1797,2.0,"Who is driving the van.  I mean seriously, I am watching this to see who is driving the freaking thing.  It is irritating me to no end.  I mean who is driving the van!  Oh, yeah, it is worth watching in parts over several days 5 minutes at a time.  Other then that you might want to claw your eyes out with a dull spoon.  I really want one of those self driving van."
1798,4.0,"A lot of freaking movies for the money. Some of them suck, but the classics and hidden unknown surprise gems made it worth it by far. I'm not disappointed."
1799,5.0,"The 2nd season of Ai Yori Aoshi started out good! Actually, so good in fact that it gives you that feeling of reuniting all the fun you had with the first season. Aoi's ukeness is still there. Chika's cuteness is still there. Miyabi's nagginess is still there. Hell, even Tina's booze drinking is still there! ^o^

This 13 episode season has some of the cutest moments, and I love seeing Aoi and Kaoru share intimate moments. It shows how strong love can be, even in the modern world of angst. Though is it just me, or does Enishi have lots more fan service than before? Very Love Hina like, well sorta! Tina Foster is so freaking hilarious, and hearing her in the dub is a treat. Who doesn't love a hyper american fondling boobs *o* She's my idol! LOL

The dubbing isint that bad either! They perfected Aoi's submissive tone, Taeko's clumsy tone and Tina's southern USA tone convinced me. Though some of the secondary characters sounded whacked. Both Pioneer(Geneon) ADV Films, etc. never had a perfect cast of VAs, but rarely get close.

I truely recommend it to those who loved the original season <3 Though I don't recommend it to Love Hina fans, don't expect Kaoru to get knocked 1,000 feet in the air and still survive @o@ Anyway The opening ""Takaramono"" and closing ""I do"" are wonderful! Yoko Ishida's Takaramono is just as memorable as Towa no Hana.

I'm a legend in the Otaku world, and I recommend this anime! Whoever doesn't thinks so, well too bad! Cliches are cliches, and Ai Yori Aoshi Enishi lives up to it's 24 episode original."

1801,5.0,"The movie itself is very unique and original. I absolutely loved it. The switch from 16mm grainy footage to moments of 35mm beauty was just spectacualr, and the narrative the film tells was very intriguing. Most people that I have talk to that have seen this were put down by the red watermark in the upper right hand corner of the film, but I found that it added a whole new level to the film. The watermark appears when the word ""Epidemic"" is being typed on the cover page of a script that Lars and Neils are working on, and stays mostly visible throughout the film to signify that what you are viewing is the screenplay (or is it? :D) It works for me. The plot takes enough meaningful sharp lefts that it stayed very interesting and kept me asking ""Where is this going?"" but in a good way.
And that ending...just so freaking awesome. To me, it makes the film worth watching (setting aside the relatively slow pacing at times).

The only thing I have against the film is the song that plays for the end credits...it is so terrible. I mean, if Trier's purpose for the song was to bring the audience out of the experience that the film throws you into, then he achieved his goal. Right after that amazing finale, I was letting the movie sink in, and wating for the credits, and this horrible pop theme song for the film begins playing. I almost shed tears of disappointment. That set aside, the movie, as a whole, is just awesome.

Word to the wise: Take the movie out after it is over, and don't wait for the credits to role..."
1802,4.0,"I never had a chance to watch this back in the 80's. I saw like one episode back then and that was that. So watching the pilot episode, I realized how the 80's clothes and people's attitude were back then; freaking dreadful!!! Omg the bell bottom pants!! And the cars....and oh wow, the land line phones! Remember the rotary phones?! They still had those back then too. The story didn't make sense. Wish they were a bit more descriptive about who the aliens were and did he really have to lose the instruction manual too? This is so 80's...glad I don't remember it as much. It was a decent show...but I liked Knight Rider and the A Team a whole lot better. And Yes, they were cheesy too! LOL"
1803,4.0,"This is a cartoon about panties.  That's pretty much it.  The whole thing is a series of short episodes that have guys acting in perverted an amusing ways to try to sneak a peak up a skirt or down a blouse.  The stories of the various characters carry through from episode to episode and sometimes intertwine.  If you're expecting depth of story here, forget it.  If you're expecting debauchery and perverted humor then you've come to the right place.

The bad, well it's the filler.  A large amount of the run time, maybe as much as 20% is taken up with fairly pointless intro and credits for each one as well as a number of segways in the same episode.  It's rather annoying and made me feel slightly cheated as to the actual play length of the disk.

There is also a making of video which was freaking hilarious.  I normally don't watch special features on any disk, but I've watched that one a couple of times.  It's not the normal making of you'd expect and has some pretty amusing caste interactions.  If you can get this disk cheap then I'd recommend it.  Just to be clear though, while there's nothing actually pornographic, it's not for the little kids."
1804,1.0,"WOW!  I am so uneducated that ""EYE"" do not know that to fake a moon landing ""EYE"" need the flag to be extremely stiff, and in my lack of knowledge ""EYE"" do not know to go to a professional cleaners and tell them to ""starch"" the flag stiff in order to fool people in a moon landing.  ""EYE"" cannot begin to imagine how much money this film cost in that it could have helped the poor and/or science, and if Amazon Prime becomes the bottom feeder of cable television they will lose me as a customer has cable television did in the late 1990's.  I expect intelligence when ""EYE"" want knowledge, and for GOD's sake learn that ""STARCH"" is common knowledge before the moon landing in that starch can make fabrics stiff; freaking idiocracy roman pigs in their stupidity believing everybody wants to be this crap.  Make up your mind Amazon PRIME!  Grow Up and keep a customer, or hold me back and become extinct in my life like cable television!  EYE 5"
1805,1.0,"Not to mention the worst plot ever regarding prostitution.

I admit ""Bad Guy"" was a bit out there but that was a brilliant film regarding the life of a prostitute. The woman hated what she was being forced to do and she hated herself for having to do it. In the end the life she is forced to live turns her into what she never thought she would be.

This film on the other hand is ridiculous. Two girls decide to start a prostitution business because they want to go on a trip to Europe? Are you freaking kidding me? Deuce Bigalow had a better reason to sell his body than this. The main thing to hate about this movie is that the characters aren't realistic. They treat their little business like it's selling girlscout cookies and in the end reality is brought in when one of the girls takes a turn for the worse.

That's when the movie just detaches itself completely from logic. The girl who pimped her friend had a good home. A loving home where her father did all he could for her. Made her breakfast in the morning, drove her to school, kept up with her school affairs. ETC. She wasn't rich and she wasn't poor either. She had no reason or any real motive to sell her body herself other than the silly one the film provides.

Most women prostitute themselves because they run away from a bad home and they have no where to turn to they get swept up in the street life. This movie isn't stimulating at all. It makes prostitution look like a bake sale then tries to be serious and philosophical about it all. This movie is great to watch for anyone that doesn't know anything about real prostitution. To them it probably seems like a realistic story. To those that do it's like watching a fairytale. A movie about a girl that wants to become a prostitute because she wants a dream vacation or she wants to cure her grief. GIVE ME A BREAK!

1 Star because this film couldn't be further from reality. There's other films based around good girl gone bad ideas like this that are far worth your time if you want something that's more realistic. Otherwise this is another made for the movies film that takes real life issues and strings them into fantasy.

It's not so much that I think this movie is trash. As a drama it's fine...it's just that I don't like when a drama movie takes reality and turns it into fantasy."
1806,5.0,"this anime is so freaking kool you will love it, it has action draMA COMEDY & ROMANCE JUST GET IT!"
1807,1.0,"For $1,200?!  Liked the anime a lot, but not THAT much.  That's a freaking month's rent on an apartment,  not a price for a thirteen episode anime."
1808,3.0,"This is about a mysterious infectious agent, that of course escapes - in Alaska, through which it was being transported on its way to a bio-facility.  There is a group quarantined, so it is a kind of character study.  Left to themselves, they interact in strange ways, waiting and hoping for a cure, freaking out to put it mildly.  It is really scary, at least for me, as I always feared this kind of alien contamination in scifi when I was growing up.

Very much like Andromeda Strain, but much much darker.  The actors are a bit amateurish, but not so bad.

Recommended."

1811,2.0,"A group of young adults go to an isolated home, cue spinner...slasher film.

This is a slasher film that involved a group of young teens away to party for the weekend. Luckily grandma owned a pool table. The one kid who wasn't invited was the weird looking guy with the eye make up and black lipstick (Ryan Carty). Seems he was put away for allegedly killing his parents, but now he is out and following the gang.

The characters were rather dry. The conversations were boring as secrets are revealed... My goodness they are high school students. How many freaking secrets can they have?  Anyway the killer may not be who you expect, which is a plus, but the cast of characters were a bore unless maybe you are in high school and a discussion of PMS vs testosterone is entertaining.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity."
1812,3.0,"This was a sad ppv to be in the pretty exciting year of 2006, but had some nice matches.

Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero
This was a nice opener to a dissapointing ppv. This was practically a cruiserweight match and did have some nice highflying action. These two always have pretty good matches, and this feud continued all the way to no mercy where these two met up in a falls count anywhere, but these two put on a nice match. 3/5

Extreme Rules match for the ECW championship
Big Show vs. Sabu
Well, that tuesday before the ppv, Sabu defeated RVD in a ladder match for the number one contendership to the title. These two, minus the height advantage, these two made a pretty good match. This was the time of ECW becoming a part of the WWE, and they pushed them nicely. This match had chairs, broken tables, and pretty nice action. There were three huge table spots in this match that i enjoyed very well. But Show did pull off a good win. 3.5/5

Hulk Hogan vs. Randy Orton
What i have to say about this match is that it is ten freaking minuets of slow, boring, out of place action. This had a nice build up leading to the match but was just a load of crap once these two faced here. Im sorry to all Hogan fans, but he sucks here. 1/5

I Quit match
Ric Flair vs. Mick Foley
This was the most hardcore match on the card. Because of the stipulation, i had a nice feeling how this would turn out. These men practically beatthe living crap out of each other and was just bloodied at the end. There was barbed wire boards, barbed wire bats, tacs, and much more. This match was slow at times, but lived up to expectations. 3.75/5

World Heavyweight championship
Booker T vs. Batista
This match was another cluncker. This match really stunk easpecially at the end when Booker got himself disqualified. This match had no spark, and was just a waste of 13 minuets. This match had some moments, but they just wern't good enough to save this match. This was the down side of the two last matches of the ppv. 2/5

WWE championship
Edge vs. John Cena
This was the worst encounter between these two superstars. This match didn't even exceed the sixteen minuet mark. This was sthe longest match of the night and it was only fifteen minuets. But the action was pretty good, its just this match could have been a whole lot better. this match was a waste after the shot to the back of the head from Edge with brass knucks. The crowd was really dissapointed, but this was a perfect storyline to put up fot the unforgiven TLC match between these two. Watchable, but very screwy. 3.5/5

Sadly, this ppv was a waste for the biggest event of the summer, and no match on my review made it to either four stars, or higher. So, i don't really recommend it. But thanks for reading and please rate!"
1813,5.0,"Pretty brilliant, this movie was fun as heck.  First of all you will want to know that the film is crude with a capital CRUDE.  Sometimes X-rated humor (although semen has made it's inroads into R-rated movies so maybe not X), the humor is also delightfully immature as in a farting scene (which frankly if you don't understand the absurdist humor of this scene you won't understand any of the movie).  However, if the immaturity of today's youth turns you off as it turns me off, don't worry as the whole film achieves a timeless vulgarity.  I think it would have been at home on the vaudeville stage of Mozart's time (at least according to Amadeus). Now technical stuff.  Acting was spot on and a joy to watch. These are real performers, not some nobody's relatives. I even developed a fondness for many of the characters!  It has a very low budget, but a level of professionalism was attained in every shot.  It is shot like an old Dracula movie, practically back in Nosferatu times, with characters you would recognize from the same. Because the budget is ultra low and this is supposed to take place in a gothic-y mansion, extreme close-ups were successfully utilized to minimize suspension of disbelief. The film comes together remarkably well all things considered, and I loved every freaking minute of it!"
1814,5.0,"I first watched this series when G4 was known as G4 Tech Tv, and had an anime section, and wasn't lame.  The show seemed pretty cool, even though I didn't understand everything.

I watch the whole series again a 2nd time through a couple years later.  Pretty much had the same reaction, except that I understood it a little more.

Recently, I decided to give the Boogiepop Phantom DVD Thinpak Collection (2000) a purchase.  I chose that version of the DVD collection for 2 reasons.  1, it has a live action movie that is a prequel to the series, so I figured it would fill me in on details that are tough or impossible to catch in the anime.  2, English commentary on the episodes.

But then I decided to go a step further.  I purchased 2 of the light novels.  Boogiepop and Others (the first light novel written I believe, and is the novel that the movie is based on [obviously, since it has the same title]), and Boogiepop at Dawn.  I read both of those novels first before re-watching the series (starting with Boogiepop and Others), and I have to say, both of them are mandatory.  They give you background on so much stuff in the anime.  In fact, while watching the series again, I realized that the anime kind of assumes the viewer has already read these novels.  They're worth a read, and they won't take long to finish.  They are ""light"" novels after all.

So after all that, I first tried to watch the live action adaptation of Boogiepop and Others.  In a nutshell, it's bad.  I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole thing after seeing how much they butcher the novel (okay, they didn't exactly butcher it, but they could've done a hell of a lot better, even with the low budget).

There were only 2 things I liked about what I managed to watch from the movie.  1, the Warning label that comes up at the beginning of every movie, that says you will be sued up the @$$ and imprisoned if you make copies of the video and put it online.  What they do with this is so freaking brilliant and hilarious, I wonder why no slasher movies have done the same thing.  They have the warning copyright notice as usual, but instead of a blank background screen, they show 3 dead students in the background.  It took me a moment to consider the implications of this [don't make bootlegs, or this will be your fate], and once that moment passed, I was laughing for 5 minutes straight .  Anyway, the 2nd thing I liked was the Manticore (or just a regular schoolgirl since they couldn't afford make-up effects, not that they would need much for this) at the beginning of the film.  She is sitting over a dead(?) girl, and licks her eyeball while her eyelids are open.  Since this movie is low budget to the point of being unable to afford decent makeup effects or costumes (the Boogiepop outfit is a joke; seriously, it made me laugh), I'm pretty sure this wasn't a prop.  These were two real actresses in the scene, one of them having nerves of steel to keep her eye open, and the other not managing to gag while licking her eyeball.  That sequence is gag-worthy, unsettling, a little creepy, and great.  Props to the one who got her eye licked.  I don't know how she was able to keep her eye open and not flinch during that whole sequence, but she did it.

And that's it, those are the only 2 reasons to watch the first 10-15 minutes of the live action film.  It gets too boring to bear watching the rest, so I fast-forwarded to the finale sequence, and it's just as irritating as the rest of the film, seeing what they changed.  They didn't exactly change anything that affects the plot in a major way, but if you see it after reading the light novel, you will be asking ""Why?"" the whole time you're watching the movie.

As for the anime, it got a whole lot better having knowledge gained from the 2 light novels.  This show doesn't hold your hand.  It expects the viewers to be of decent intelligence, and expects their full attention and focus while watching each episode, like Serial Experiments Lain except that this show rewards your dedication and gets better with each viewing.

The first two episodes let you know exactly what you're getting into, and will immediately let you know if this is the show for you, or not.  The strange blurred style, the unique music, the mystery, the fact that you will come to know other characters that you only catch a glimpse of in previous episodes, and the supernatural things that happen.  I would recommend watching the first 2 episodes, and if it seems interesting to you at all in anyway, and you want to watch the rest of the series, read the 2 light novels first, then watch the series.  Trust me, you will be glad you did.  That said, so long as you really pay attention, you can enjoy the series for what it is without reading the novels.

People have compared this show to Lain.  I'll admit, the comparisons aren't without warrant.  Both are weird in their own way, and both demand your attention and thinking caps.  But I would also compare this show to The Wire.  I only make that comparison with the knowledge gained from the 2 novels.  Here's why.  By the end of the series, in the final moments of the final episode, it gets pretty emotional.  Why?  Because it's like the last page of a big novel has just been turned, and it's over.  It's the end of it all.  It's bittersweet, not everyone gets what they wanted, some turn out better than others.  But in the end, it's goodbye.  It's the end of an important time in the lives of the characters we come to know from the novels and at points in the anime.  They all know this is the end of their youth, and they have to say goodbye to each other, and to the lives they had.  It's a feeling you can only get if you've come to know the characters through the novels, which increases the emotional impact of the final moments of the last episode by ten-fold.  Let me put it this way, without reading the novels, it's like watching Kingdom of Heaven.  With the novels, it's Kingdom of Heaven The Director's Cut.

Oh yeah, and the commentary.  Man, these English guys who worked on getting this anime stateside, we couldn't have gotten it from a better group.  These guys are passionate about this anime.  Just listening to the commentary on some of the episodes, seeing their notes on the Bonus Feature on the final dvd disc.  Whichever version of the anime set you get, make sure it has the English Producers commentary on it.  The only thing that would make the set any more perfect is if it came with the 2 light novels (especially if they replace the live-action movie).

I recommend this series, big time."
1815,5.0,this anime is so freaking cute you gotta see its a great chick flick us girls would totally enjoy it.
1816,4.0,"This was the right way to start off a nice year in 2007, and was definatly a great ppv.

Steel Cage match for the Intercontinental championship
Jeff Hardy vs. Johnny Nitro(John Morrison)
This was a great way to start off a exciting event. These two put everything in there skills into this match. These guys had some huge moments like a sunset flip powerbomb off the top rope, Melina gettign involved, and a brutal moment where nitro was escaping, and hardy opened the door and nitro slipped, landed on the door, and injured his crotch(which was also the funniest moment in the match)and getting a huge laughing reaction from Jerry Lawler. 4.5/5

Tag Team Turmoil for a shot at the World Tag Team championship
This match included Cryme Tyme, The Highlanders, The worlds greatest tag team(the worlds lamest tag team), jim duggan and super crazy, lance cade and trevor murdoch. This was actually a pretty nice turn out to this match, having the few highflying moments, and the most surprising moment, with Cryme Tyme actually winning a match that would be big to there career. But i enjoyed this, and thought that it was surprising, especially with the tag team of jim duggan and SUPER CRAZY! 3.75/5

Kenny Dykstra vs. Ric Flair
Well, this match ruined two good matches in a row, this match ruined the streak. All this was, was just Kenny being a freaking jackass and beating a legend who can bearly talk anymore without spitting in someones face, so really big whoop, because this match should have never even been on the card. 2/5

Womans championship
Mickie James vs. Victoria
This was another waste of time, these two woman are great fighters, but here they just didn't put on a good match at all, this isn't even worth watching and is boring. A usual thing in the Diva division. 1/5

World Tag-Team championship
DX vs. Rated RKO
This of course was the best match on the card. These guys put on a freakin show. This match was never boring at any point and was match of the night. This was brutal and had some huge moments like. Triple H injuring his knee, which is one part of how this match was a no contest. Another was when chairs came into affect, and the pedigree on edge on the announce table and a elbow drop on Orton through the announce table. So, if you had any word to describe this match, it would be this, classic. These guys just went out there and did everything they could. Great match. 5/5

Chris Masters vs. Carlito
Why would WWE schedual this match to be after a classic like Rated RKO vs. DX. This match was only domination from Chris Masters and was a waste of time, this was also another match that shouldn't have been on the card. 2/5

WWE championship
John Cena vs. Umaga
Another good match for the night. This wasn't a classic, but the last man standing match a month later sure was. But these men went out there, and did everything they could like DX and Rated RKO. But in this match, this was Umagas first loss in the WWE, Cena again was put in the main event and over came the odds. But, i gotta give him props, he beat Umaga(R.I.P)twice in a row. But this almost deserved to be the main event. 4.5/5

Overall, this ppv was really good, sure it had some crapy matches, but had some great matches. I would recommend picking this one up."

1818,3.0,"CHRISTMAS LILIES OF THE FIELD

So theres this film called Lilies Of The Field you may have heard of. It wasn't a very big deal, except for the fact that it explored old themes of pride and isolation with a fresh story-telling innovation, wrapped in a plot that for a drama is all but enthralling, adapted from a novel of the rarest literary value written about a legendary but [purportedly] true story... and oh, its star won an Academy Award, and that star just happened to be Sidney Poitier, the first African American ever to take home the prestigious Best Actor award for his leading role, and all this happened while Dr. Martin Luther King was alive and fighting tooth and nail for black rights.

So yeah, its kind of a big deal. Lilies of the Field broke ground on every aspect and facet.

And then theres Christmas Lilies Of The Field, its made-for-TV Christmas special sequel.

Im not saying that it couldn't be done. That it was impossible to craft a followup which would ever be anything more than an amazing films sorta-dumb tagalong little-brother.

But as moving and groundbreaking a film and story as the original was, they probably shouldnt have tried.

If you haven't seen the original, stop. Stop right now. Abandon ship. Go and watch the original Lilies, STAT, before I call you uncultured swine. I try not to reveal any more than the inciting event in any review, but considering this ones a sequel, I cant be held responsible for spoiling anything in the original.

If you read any further, and I happen to ruin an American classic that youve never seen before, thats on you, buddy.

The OG Lilies introduces Homer Smith, a vagrant laborer who dreams of becoming an architect. Its a tale of a self-generating destiny overtaking the man. In the middle of the desert he encounters a group of German nuns who, we learn in due time, have hurdled monstrous adversity to escape Soviet-controlled parts of Europe and immigrate to Arizona, where they manage a meager living pulling the proverbial water from the rock and farming the barren desert. Smith stops to help them mend a fence on the hopes hell be paid, only to meet his match in the iron-willed Mother Superior: they quote a few scriptures, Smiths scripture hinting that he ought to be paid and Mother Superiors suggesting the opposite. Mother Superior gets the upper hand and manages to convince Smith to stay on for another odd-job the next day.

Thus shanghaied, Smith finds himself all but obligated to continue his work helping the nuns. They continue to not pay him, and its a case of worlds colliding when Smith (a Baptist) is immersed in their Catholic world, but an undeniable bond is building. Smiths growing friendship with the nuns culminates in admitting his dream of being an architect and agreeing to construct a chapel so that they and their parishioners don't have to walk miles to the next towns chapel, and despite Smiths obstinate insistence that he alone build it, the nuns and community band together to assist in the mammoth project. Eventually  here comes in the self-generating destiny  they come to believe Smith was sent by God on a mission to help them.

Well, hey, Id find it hard to argue with a bunch of nice nuns too. What are you going to do; tell them Screw you, God didn't send me, Im out?

The bittersweet ending revolves around these two indomitable wills, Mother Superior and Smith, whove butted heads throughout the film. Smith completes the chapel, and Mother Superior finally gives thanks to him directly (whereas before shes been careful to thank only God). They and the nuns sing one last Baptist riff together, and Smith quietly departs onto fates unknown, supposedly forever. Mother Superior, knowing hes leaving, makes no further efforts to twist his arm or dominate his choice with any quoted scripture.

Youre satisfied with this ending. It isn't 100% happily-ever-after, but its good enough. After a long struggle these two have finally come to understand each other.

Which brings me at last to why this sequel should not have been made: its a freaking Christmas special.

Lando Calrissian/Apollo Creed (known as Billy Dee Williams to some people) takes over the leading role in Christmas Lilies Of The Field, and I have no complaints there. Hes a versatile enough actor to work with what hes given. But let me give you the (somewhat mocking) rundown of exactly what they gave him to work with.

Homer Smith is back! Hes been reunited with the nuns after coming to reinspect his work on the chapel and ensure its still up to spec. But wait; whats this?

A busload of adorable children? Not just children- orphans. Thanks for the chapel, Lando, but we need an orphanage now, and its got to be done before Christmas or the Big Bad State is going to send them all to foster homes.

Oh, and one of the orphans is pregnant. Will the baby be born healthy, and on Christmas Eve? I have a feeling I know the answer to that!

Basically, its a But-The-Children! plot, and its totally lame.

OG Lilies is a like a five-course meal engineered by a nutritional scientist. Its everything you want out of this sort of drama. Its the porterhouse steak; its the salad; its expert wine-pairings; its a delicious desert you don't feel guilty about.

Christmas Lilies? Christmas Lilies demands a happily-ever-after by its very nature. Christmas Lilies is rock-candy dipped in chocolate, drizzled with caramel, and liberally coated with sugar.

I enjoyed the movie for what it was. I had no delusions going into it. This was a light-hearted sequel which never aimed to break new ground.

But after OG Lilies, that just wasn't enough. OG Lilies deserves better.

My message to filmmakers? If a sequel cant at least match its original, don't bother.

My message to viewers? If you're the kind of person who likes Christmas Specials, have at it. If you're here for that same fulfillment you found in OG Lilies, though, you're barking up the wrong tree."
1819,4.0,"Since there are so few reviews about that movie, maybe you don't know what to expect from it. I tell you what to expect : a lot of bloody freaking fun !! If you can stand micro budget movie making that is. Some people are turned off by the lack of production values ? Too bad for them, they are definitely missing something here.
To me that flick has everything it needs : a forest, a camp, a lake, a bunch of demonic zombies and A LOT of gore ( I'm talking about entrails and body parts all over the place ). Plus it really is funny and even mannages to be sort of scary at times.
It has a basic effective EVIL DEAD like plot : some partying teens go to some cabin in the woods... some of them get possessed by the forest's  evil spirits and start to attack and eat their friends. It is well shot : the photography and angles beautifully exploit the landscape and the action. By the way, it moves fast, hand in hand with the top notch editing. That movie delivers the goods and then some and I think most gorehounds will agree. Don't pay attention to the fools who fast forward through the movies they review and hate( ain't that a shame ? ).
If you crave for laughs, gore and scares, if you love movies like DEMONS, EVIL DEAD or SAVAGE HARVEST and can stand no budget flicks ( I'm talking about video shooting and amateurish acting here ): then what the hell are you doing reading this review ? Just buy the damn thing !! Thanks to BRIAN SINGLETON and his friends for the crazy ride, I sure will keep an eye on these folks."
1820,3.0,"The Big Cube came out at the height of the counter-culture movement in 1969. Its a groovy, sometimes campy melodrama about a teenager (Karin Mossberg) who is negatively influenced by the wicked medical student shes dating (George Chakiris). They implement gaslighting techniques on her sweet stepmother (Lana Turner) to acquire inheritance. Dan O'Herlihy plays the husband of Lanas character and Richard Egan her good friend. Carlos East plays a right on artist and Pamela Rodgers the teens swinging best friend.

Despite some roll-your-eyes campiness, mainly by Pamela Rodgers, the first half is entertaining as it tries to depict the hip late 60s scene, at least as far as Hollywood producers imagined it. Speaking of Rodgers, shes absolutely perky and likable and has a cute face, but her topless dance routine shows that she really wasn't very sexy, unless you're into thin, non-curvy women. In any case, the movies amusing in a far out kind of way. Unfortunately, it takes a decidedly dull turn as soon as the youths start freaking out the stepmother with LSD. Its so bad its tempting to tune-out. However, I like the comeuppance and redemption of the conclusion.

Lana was 47 during filming and looked good.

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Acapulco and Mexico City, Mexico.

GRADE: C"
1821,3.0,"This is a likely made for TV movie.  If you're finding this in physical stores these days you're only paying a couple of dollars for it, it's amongst a wide range of budget DVDs with a big name to get you to pick it up. In fact you can also get this one with three other movies based on Nora Roberts books for the same couple of dollars price the other single movies go for. So I base my rating on the fact you're likely only paying a dollar or two for this or watching it on TV. Of course if you're buying this in a few years time and having to pay a regular movie DVD price or even more, well you might be a bit more critical. But for me, for a cheap budget movie, Blue Smoke, although not as good as Angels Falls and Montana Sky, two of the other three 4 pack movies I've watched so far, is a lot better most of the other movies you'll get for the same price.

Following the formula the cast including the lead are pretty much unknown actors, with the big pay cheque obviously going to Scott Bakula (NCIS New Orleans, although he was obviously famous from other TV shows as Blue Smoke was released in 2007), to have some sort of guaranteed return from fans of the shows he was in.  He's not the main character though, he's the fire investigator chief, the main character is Reena (played by Alicia Witt).  Reena as a girl watched her parent's pizza restaurant burn to the ground and was fascinated by the flames.  She met Bakula when sneaking under the caution tape who told her she was very observant and now as an adult is one of his employees.  However she's also constantly freaking out when seeing flames, since a guy she slept with when at a teen party burnt to death in the bed that she helped light ridiculously over sized candles nearby to set the mood, and because as we said they both knew she loved flames.  Now in her adult life any guy who seems interested in her also meets a crispy demise.  The point of the film is we the viewer are supposed to work out who of the men in her life is the one who is murdering these guys.  Or perhaps it's even her as we've seen in many similar telemovies, sometimes the victim is just crazy.  I found this premise really didn't hold up long into the movie, I also found the lead character to be too ditzy to really care much about her survival or happiness either.  When her kid was a character she was really intelligent and strong willed, but the adult version was almost a bimbo.  The second murder also was very cheaply shot, it was obvious video game like computer graphics on top of the shot footage.

I kind of can't really talk more about why this was only really an average movie, even for a made for TV film without giving away spoilers, so if you haven't seen it yet but likely still will, I'd stop reading this review here.

I actually thought two characters were the same one as the two actors looked so similar, until the florist shop bombing victim was killed, and we see the party love at first sight guy again running to her car in the snow when she's stopped at an intersection.  Surely they could found two slightly more different looking actors than these two.  At times Reena wasn't the only really dumb character, early in the film some other bimbo sits on a stove with high flames, now if it was just a regular hot plate that was left on for some reason and she didn't know that would be one thing, but these were high flames.  The end scenes were also ridiculous, what was with the pointy stick out ears and weird voice of her stalker. Would have blended in a bit more if he just talked and looked normal.  How did he know the fireman was going to buy flowers to set a bomb in that shop?  How did she not think the guy who tried to rape her as a kid was not the main suspect?  How did she not even mention this occurred to everyone else trying to find her stalker?

Does fire training in the US really involve a game of finding hidden doors and fake walls and crawling over the top of monkey bars with huge flames underneath while running out air where if you fail you will at least be severely burnt if not die.  And if so would you really let a woman you know freezes and goes into memory flashbacks where she isn't aware of the current world for long periods of time when she sees a particularly interesting flame wobble, do that course?"
1822,2.0,"As a collector of Asian horror movies I became excited as news of this movie reached me, so naturally I bought it to add to my collection. Well it moved a bit slow for my liking but I was sure It would pick up... oh it did pick up right into a freaking mess. The story/concept itself was really cool so I made myself finish it. When the ghost appears I wound up laughing really heard because it was just so silly and not frightening, my room mate rolled his eyes and got up. A weak entry into the asian haunting genre and especially the last part of the films laughable special effects. I'll keep it in my collection but deffinately not a favorite. If you're really curious check it out but for sure for die hard Asian horror fans."
1823,5.0,This movie is so freaking good I love it I can watch it over and over again lol
1824,5.0,I freaking love it. Perfect amount of horror and comedy. Some of the characters even have common sense. It's refreshing.
1825,5.0,"Compared to The Streak DVD which features only 5 more matches than this but it costs 15 dollars more, This DVD is a freaking steal. Don't see why people hate it so much."
1826,2.0,"Man, somebody should review the reviewers of this movie.  Mr. ""Pericles"", you know way too much about a no name director, therefore you are plugging what would have otherwise been a very forgettable exercise in the genre.  Also, that scene you mentioned about the zombie experimentation?  That was a whopping minute and a half in movie that clocked in at over 90 minutes.  And as for Mr. ""Bill"" from Georgia, I saw both Count Yorga and I Eat Your Flesh and I have no freaking clue how you can draw a line of comparison between the two.  Yorga and Flesh were B movies, but not amateur.  This barely qualifies as a college thesis.  Not to slam Ms. Parker's movie entirely, it does deserve respect for the indie film that it is.  It is certainly no crime to make an extremely low budget film.  Good ideas and semi-plausible acting go a long way.  Where Parker's film falls short is in the story itself.  There are scenes of discontinuity that will make you smack your head in disbelief at how a director could let that go by:  one minute the rabbit is putting the chomp on someone and beginning the chain of events, then a real estate agent is getting mauled by a zombie that had obviously been shambling around the real estate dig for quite some time; there is a huge, revelatory flashback that does nothing to either move the story along or resolve it; another scientist, who had only one purpose of hunting for the rabbit and finding it, escapes a zombie mauling and falls unconscious for almost a day (???); the principal leads are all left hanging--I mean, one minute someone is spraying aerosol and then they are barricading the door and . . . . cut to that scientist's scene and roll the credits--you are guaranteed to say WTF.  Oh, and by the way Mr. Atragon, the choice of music sucked!  Who plays happy grunge music to build tension during a zombie mauling?  Think that's bad?  Listen to what's playing when one of the leads has to bury his cheating wife.  Here's a summary breakdown:
Acting--decent
Story--looked good on paper, but poorly executed
Rabbits--HOLY CRAP!!!!!!  That rabbit was the absolute best part of the movie!  It totally channeled Monty Python and the Caddyshack gopher.
Gore--respectable
Zombies--yet another indie movie that can't make up its mind whether to have the zombies run balls out, or take half a day to shamble somewhere; the redneck zombies at the beginning are annoying at first, but they'll grow on you!
Shooting/lighting--annoying at times, passable at most
Tension/story movement--the first 30 minutes were pretty good,
  but then the film bottoms out miserably."
1827,4.0,"If you'd ever been fooled by simply looking at the likes of B J Penn, and assuming he's a chump, that's a bad assumption you just made! Before I watched the fight with Matt Hughes in UFC 46, I'd picked up UFC 58, and I laughed when I saw that some dude named B J Penn was taking on Georges St. Pierre. Well, St. Pierre won, but by split decision. B J Penn is one tough dude, and don't you doubt that for one second! When you can do things with your legs without the help of your arms, that's impressive. Then you have Joe Stevenson, winner of TUF #2, not to mention he's won over a ton of people! After he defeated Luke Cummo to win the contract, he fought Yves Edwards in UFC 61. No fight with a man like Yves Edwards is an easy fight, but due to cuts on the top of his head, the fight was stopped after the 2nd round, and Stevenson was awarded the win by TKO. His latest fight was an impressive unanimous decision over Kurt Pellegrino, and ""Joe Daddy"" was given this opportunity. The opportunity to win the Lightweight title. You just have to get past B J Penn! But the title is an interim title since Sean Sherk was stripped of the title after being found guilty by the California State Athletic Commission. We've got a title fight!!
Now the other fight featured the the gladiator introduction is a strange but interesting match-up. Fabricio Werdum is taking on Gabriel Gonzaga. Well, WHOOP-TEE-DOO, right? Maybe, but why? What makes this such a co-main event over the other fights on the card? Well, before his title shot loss to Randy Couture, Werdum was the only man to defeat Gonzaga. It was in 2003, and it was in the 3rd round by TKO. And having a pretty crappy performance in his UFC debut when he fought Andre Arlovski, this might be a chance for redemption. It is also a chance for Gonzaga to get back on track, as well as avenge his very first loss.

This was a UFC where some of the preliminary fights simply needed to stay preliminary, but not all of them. And it was a decent card altogether. There are 9 fights total, and I'll list them below.

Sam Stout vs. Per Eklund: Stout wants to come out swinging and finish his Swedish opponent. It gets interesting at times, but nothing too impressive. Goes to a unanimous decision.

Alessio Sakara vs. James Lee: This ended pretty quickly, but was it stopped TOO quickly? TKO victory.

Paul Kelly vs. Paul Taylor: This was a brawl! This was a war!! Scraps like this keep the fans coming back! Unanimous decision.

Antoni Hardonk vs. Colin Robinson: Another quick one, quicker than the Sakara/Lee fight. TKO.

Jorge Rivera vs. Kendall Grove: Both of these guys are coming off of KO losses, looking to get back on track. This finishes with a KO in under a minute and a half.

Wilson Gouveia vs. Jason Lambert: Both of these guys have shown some tough stuff in the past. You wanna talk highlight knock outs? THIS IS A HIGHLIGHT REEL KO in round 2!

Jess Liaudin vs. Marcus Davis: Hey! Another KO!! 1st round.

Gabriel Gonzaga vs. Fabricio Werdum: Well, one of these guys gets back on track with a TKO near the end of round 2.

B J Penn vs. Joe Stevenson: Ok, in the dictionary under BLOODBATH, it says, SEE THIS FIGHT!!! I mean, that freaking octagon floor could've been painted with blood in this. But it ends with a submission near the end of round 2.

What else can be said? Oh yeah!

SEAN SHERK...YOU'RE DEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1828,1.0,"Frightworld begins showing a news reporter interviewing people about a murderer going around.  A guy won't respond to his wife being murdered.  We see a woman hanging in a basement while cops run around outside.  The killer grabs the hanging woman's stomach as the cops break in.  The killer sneaks up from behind and slashes the cops with an ax.  One cop has barbed wire lowered into his face and eyes.  Another cop gets an ax to the stomach.  The next cop sneaks around quietly and has a pole shoot up through the floor which pokes through his body.  The final cop says ""Shut up, drop your weapon and get to your knees!""  The killer walks up to the cop and sticks a sharp object in his stomach.  Another cop sees a ghost of a woman he knows say ""It's been so long, I love you real bad"".  He points a gun to her head and shoots.  The hanging woman says ""Get me out of here!""  The cop dies before he can untie her.  It's now the next day.  The killer crawls across the ground under a building.  He sees images of ghost children.  He's injured but barely makes it in the door.  What a long introduction!

The movie relies heavily on quick images immediately shifting into more quick images, and it's really awful.  We have horrible music to hear while this happens too.  This means it's hard to see what's going on and *especially* hard to follow the story.  The whole movie's like this, but for now some of these images include a man hiding in the corner of a building, a spider crawling on a dead guy's face, and Steven Tyler standing around with blood dripping from his mouth.

We see a black and white video of a man who opened up the Frightworld amusement park back in the 50's.  The factory of fear himself Dr. Solomon fled the revolution of bloody Sunday in Russia.  He says the horrific images he saw there influenced the horror we see in this amusement park.  But he loses money and staff, and eventually has to shut it down.  He puts away his amusement park equipment in an underground storage facility, goes home and hangs himself.

In present time we hear generic action music as these young men and women party to celebrate the grand opening of this amusement park.  These teens have no personality at all.  I mean *none*.  The generic action music is causing more harm than anything because this movie feels like a soap opera.  A man announces in 2 weeks we'll reopen the doors to Frightworld.  The picture switches to black and white as we see these men and women drink and smoke.  One of them lights a joint.  Even the way these characters converse is boring.  One man invites the group of young men and women inside Frightworld.  The man says the amusement park is complete with clowns and colors.  Never before has so much been put under one roof.

He continues.  The dead hate being dead.  Death is not the end of pain- it's the beginning.  The fences that surround the graveyard are there to keep in the dead.  Solomon brought in real grave soil for his amusement park.  Historians have observed the amusement park and throughout time evil forces have always been present here taking the lives of unsuspected passersby and adding their spirit to their very power.  The spirits still exist and roam in this amusement park.  They say the spirits can be seen sometimes.  Your phobia's are realized, and fears you thought you never had are exposed here in this amusement park.  Your mind begins to slip as you know you'll never get out.  After the instructor finishes he says this was his first draft and he has time to tweak it.  Well done, something constructive actually said!  They say ""Let's party!""  That's not constructive.

The women of the group smoke and pretend they're in a strip club taking their tops off.  At least one woman does.  The other women pretend they're guys sitting around enjoying it. A man and woman make out... somewhere in the darkness.  It's the most boring make out/sex scene ever too.  The woman says she's a virgin.  He says she doesn't look like one.  She says ""What does a virgin look like? What am I supposed to look like?  Would you prefer I wear a sun dress!"" The boring sex continues.  It's so boring I don't even know if this man and woman are the same ones from the previous make out scene.  When they fall asleep the spirit of the murderer appears.  Blood drips on the floor as bad heavy rock music plays.  Terrible screaming vocals.  We see hands swimming through silky blood.

After this the movie shoots back to the man and woman making out.  The drunk stripper girl staggers around as an actual song plays.  With a melody!  And piano and cool drumming!  And a cool lead singer who reminds me of the guy from the Monkees!  The lyrics are pretty extreme about killing and fornacating though.  The song even uses some weird effects with the carnival-like piano.  While the woman squats and pees she calls the clown on the wall a pervert and talks to him, comparing his big shoes to a small weiner.  She now sits there and gets off with her hands down her pants.  We go back to the man and woman having sex.  Suddenly he screams and covers in blood.  I guess his girlfriend bit his weinee off but it's hard to say for sure.

Another woman tells his boyfriend to keep a secret.  We can't make out the words but she's been traumatized by it and the boyfriend becomes sympathetic.  They stumble into an area covered in blood.  After her boyfriend says something silly she sarcastically says ""Do you think all this blood came from a nosebleed!""  They try to round up the rest of the group but the girls have a hangover and aren't exactly quick to leave.  The woman who was traumatized by something freaks out.  The men and women struggle to find a way out.  They get nervous and antsy.  They argue over who calls the shots pertaining to how to get out.  The woman sarcastically says ""I didn't mean to disrespect you master, yes master!""

The men find a dead body or blood (or both).  The men say they have to keep this private from the women.  The one man disagrees.  The men head back to the women and say they'll be out of here in a half hour.  A half hour from now the movie ends.  Can't wait!  The men find a puddle of blood, and then one of them gets poked in the back by a metal stick.  The one woman freaks out and threatens to kill someone in the group because she believes one of her friends is secretly the killer.  Nobody knows what she's talking about.  Makes me wonder why someone so freaked out over a traumatic event she experienced at this very place at an earlier time would return.  She tells everyone to stay away from her or she'll stick a pole in their brain.

The nerves remain tense as the group finds a way out.  They climb a ladder and try to break a metal gate.  They look through the metal gate and see it's black even though it's supposed to be morning.  Not darkness, but totally black.  Maybe, I dunno, there's something blocking the back of the wall?  That's how we usually see black in the day.  Just saying.  The guys finally reveal the dead body they saw, and when the one woman freaks out and pushes her boyfriend into a wall a claw comes out and rips him apart.  In another room a woman freaks out and punches a man.  She and her friend tie his knocked out body with rope.  The women think they've figured out who the killer is.  The one girl recommends barricading the door.  The other one disagrees and calls her a cow.  She says ""You don't go in the attic, you don't go in the basement and you darn sure don't go in creepy places!""  When persuaded to go into the creepy place given the life or death predicament they're in she freaks out and says if she dies she'll kick the girls butt sideways.  She'll also turn her butt sideways and turd cut her throat, lol.

The girls slowly calms down and think their friend will come back for both of them and get them out.  Suddenly the one girl gets her insides ripped out when she leans against the wall.  The blood splashes all over her friend's face.  Traumatized, she runs away when a monster appears.  Really terrible hard rock music plays.  It's excruciatingly bad and ruins the horrific moment.  She runs up to another woman who's a demon.  She turns around and somebody else grabs her face.  She screams and dies.  The demon girl apologizes.  I guess she's one of those on again/off again demons.  The horrible music plays again.  The camera is all over the place so we can't see what's going on.  It appears a monster is getting a metal pole shoved into him given the squirting blood though!  Wow, the camera moves so fast I can't see who's doing the killing *or* the person being killed!  This movie is so bad.

The woman who was freaking out over her traumatic ordeal from an earlier time stabs someone.  We see blood squirting on her face but the room's too dark to see who it is.  The killer appears and talks to this woman.  He says when you die your insignificant life becomes as insignificant as this movie...  I mean becomes universal awareness.  He says if she actually was able to grasp what he's saying her head would explode.  He says nothing matters in this world.  The world turns a blind eye when major catastrophes carry out.  He says God isn't here and nothing in the amusement park matters.  The woman says he's insane.

The killer says there are dark forces, and she can call them Elvis as far as he cares, lol.  He says he kills for the dark forces.  He's like Hitler or Jack the Ripper.  He says all these people have something in common- they kill for these dark forces.  The killer says he's actually dead and not used to the skin he's in.  He made sure if he died he had a back up plan.  He needs virgin blood.  The killer says he could hear this woman's voice and saw her face on the surface of some woman's eyes.  He says he didn't follow the rules so people who were supposed to live had to die.  He has to kill someone named Poptart.  He says he can relax when this virgin woman he's talking to can die.  She's the only one left.  He says he'll visit Canada for a change of scenery. ""I dunno, they seem bored!""

He goes over all the victims he killed.  In a fit of rage the killer says he can kill anyone he wants.  The woman reminds him that she was supposed to be his first victim but he saved her for last for his sick needs.  He then strangles the girl, but the appearance of a blinding light stops him.  The bad music is consuming him!  ""Stay away from me"" too!  He lights up in a ball of fire.  The girl  has visions of something evil.  She says ""I understand now"" and stands up with claws on her hands.  ""Stay away!"" plays again.

This movie has nothing but big problems.  The camera jerks around like crazy so you can't catch up to the events happening on screen.  The surroundings are dark almost the entire time.  Nothing related to the amusement park rides ever kills these characters or plays a part in any way.  Really bad hard rock music plays often.  The male characters are all completely bland but a couple of the female are decent at least (the one who had the traumatic event as well as the one who punches that guy out and ties him up).  I don't like anything about this movie."
1829,5.0,"Any of you supposed gorehounds hungry for a ridiculous serving of mayhem, filth, chaos, destruction, and insurmountable violence and human suffering? Do you crave an abundance of horrific flesh rippage and eviscerations and decapitations spiked with non stop brutality? Well you sickos better grab a bib and pull up a chair. This is some underground German gourmet! Thrown down your vulnerable little throats, low-budget horror at its absolute most vile. You better have a strong stomach to handle this non-stop barrage of nastiness. This is just flatout awesome. Dig in!

Okay, fair warning...the story here barely serves as a tablecloth. The characters barely make for an appetizer. No pretty cinematography to set the mood, no CGI to amuse the children, no clever writing to stimulate your mind...heck the budget is so low it can't come close to covering the tab. BUT!...I just don't give a darn. This is seriously one of the GREATEST FLICKS EVER MADE. Yep, I said it. I totally love this flick. Watched it three times this Halloween season.

It's a revenge flick like you've never seen. The Eightlets Mafia have a vendetta and will seriously jack some people up. Pain and misery will be dished out in spades. Only problem is...the victims won't freaking stay dead!?!?!?!? They are invincible? WTH!?!? Chainsaw to the face, skull fractureage, bullets buried in the temple...their victims just keep coming back! No clever explanation here, that's just the way it is. Deal with it.

Some people will understandably hate the cheap effects. Some of the deaths look horribly fake, I admit. When one head gets chopped off, I honestly thought the effort could have easily been better to make it look more authentic. But some of the murder shots look very good imo. Plus they are all super bloody!!! Granted sometimes the blood looks like coffee for some strange reason. But it's flowing heavy and frequently. Plus seriously, the best thing about this movie is THE ACTION NEVER STOPS!!! Fighting fighting fighting yes yes yes!! The blood flows constantly. Its crazy stupid brutal, I love it.

One example of the awesomeness--A guy gets both legs shot but can still stand up and fight. Then he gets a chainsaw to his neck with blood flying everywhere--but strangely he can grab the razor sharp vibrating blade as it shreds him apart and his hands don't even get a scratch?!? Go figure.

Need more details? We get a severed arm reattached with a nailgun. Bowling ball sized holes blown in peoples faces. Twin babies ripped from the womb and stomped on. A bucket of blood brought out to the battlefield so the wounded can get a homemade transfusion. Slicing, dicing, hacking, punching, blasting...plenty of gooey bloody insanity, just so freaking amazing it should be illegal. In fact, is is. Banned in Germany, deemed unfit for domestic viewing. Can you handle it?

Seriously, I'd rather watch this than SPLICE or H2 remake or plenty of other Hollywood ""hits"". I found this more entertaining than the Vomit Gore trilogy as well, although I did like those also. That's just me though, obviously this isn't for everyone. Bravo to Heiko Fipper, the writer, director, producer, and actor plus eveyone involved. I watched the special features, and they all had alot of fun making this movie.

If Death was a sport, this flick is batting a thousand! Step up and take a swing."

The mixer seems to have attempted to alter the audio to reflect the perspective of the camera they were on in each shot, so each instrument slides around on the sonic stage and just sounds freaking weird. Ugh. Great visuals but the awful mix ruins it."

the plot

Hollywood screenwriter, Hudson Milbank is a pretty normal guy up until one day while hanging out with his friends, he smokes a marijuana joint by himself because of peer pressure, and when he finishes he runs out of the bar freaking out from the bad trip he finds himself on as a result of said joint.  His problems begin when it is the next day and he still cannot shake this awful trip he's on.  The days and weeks go by, and he still cannot shake it.  He goes to psychiatrists and psychologists and after therapy and drug therapy he still is in this altered state, which is diagnosed as depersonalization.  This is a mental condition that causes Hudson to feel as if he is uncomfortable in his own skin, detached from feeling real emotions, or stable inside his own head.

He meets a girl named Sara on one his very few days outside of his apartment, and she is drawn to him despite his condition.  Her ex-boyfriend had committed suicide and so Hudson theorizes that Sara is just drawn to screwed up men.  When he is with Sara, he doesn't feel better, yet he finds that he is able to deal remarkably better with his condition and he is able to function almost normally in social situations.  How long will Sara put up with this condition?  Will Hudson ever be cured?  Find out when you rent or buy Numb on DVD.

the breakdown

Writer/Director Harris Goldberg does an astounding job translating his vision of what he imagines the depersonalization condition to look like.  He makes it easy to empathize with Hudson played vividly by Matthew Perry.  The unsteady camera, the echo-filled audio and some camera trickery will probably serve up one of those acid-flashbacks to the days when you were doing those nasty illegal narcotics.  If you have never done any of those silly things, well you're going to get a taste of what it's like now.  I was very impressed with the effect and it easily drew me into the movie.

Matthew Perry was very funny, and it was nice to see him in a movie as the star.  He hasn't done too much since Friends ended in 2004, and recently the biggest movie he was in was 17 Again, where he is only seen in the very beginning and end of the film.  I noted above that I found Perry funny, and it made me think about how to classify this film, I suppose it is a dark romantic comedy, although there were scenes where you would believe this was a stark drama.  His romantic interest was Sara played by Lynn Collins, a beautiful actress from such films like X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Lake House and The Number 23.  Her deep dimples are the perfect eye candy and her comedic timing is enough to keep you laughing whenever she delivers a delicious line (see top of review).

There were some aspects of the story that went unanswered, like why Hudson's mother had always lost patience with him, even since he was a small boy.  They touched upon the subject, but nothing got too deep, and that was OK by me, as I was more enamored with Hudson and Sara anyway.  Kevin Pollack, who has been in a few movies with Perry in the past, had a limited role, but this is what he excels at anyway, so it's a good thing.  Mary Steenburgen was hilarious in this film as one of Hudson's doctors, she was only in the movie for about 20 minutes at the most of the 93 minutes, but it was a very memorable performance.

The movie is rated R, and for good reason.  There is a plentitude of the F-bomb being dropped every few seconds it seems, and there is some nudity as well (not from Lynn Collins though, sorry fellas).  So how good is it?  Should you purchase this?  Well, it's pretty cheap, although it's only available on DVD to buy as of now.  I viewed this as part of my Netflix subscription,  and it was definitely worth the fee.  I can easily recommend this film for those of you into the darker side of comedies and romantic films, but for the rest of you - you may not get it.

1832,1.0,"Wow, are my eyes deceiving me?? Who in their right mind would give this HORRIBLE film more than 2 stars? Apparently a few people out there have. How they could do that is absurd! I suppose they wanted to like the movie so much they convinced themselves into doing so and ended up writing very misleading reviews about it. OK. After watching the trailer I expected this movie to be entertaining and gory, it was neither. The story is so ridiculously cliche and overdone that I can't believe any film maker in this day and age would still try to pull it off. This film brings nothing new to the table. It's not scary in any sense, the zombies look so bad I could have done a better make-up job. Gore is seldom seen in this slow paced film. Common sense is thrown out the window and the villain runs while swinging a mace around her head, do you know how heavy a freaking mace is? The kill count is so low and the deaths are not worth sitting through the movie to get to. This was one of the most over-hyped horror films in recent memory. Save your money, there are much better foreign horror films than this one. Anyone with good video equipment could have done a better job than this. The promotion and packaging for Hell's Ground fooled me, don't let it fool you."
1833,5.0,"There are just no words in the English language to describe how awesome and satisfying Gurren Laggan's ending is. After it's over you look back to the start of the series, realizing the amazing adventure they had, how they started out so small and weak below the ground and how they fought their way up until they challenged the freaking Moon and after that they killed a god, basically. The feelings, the emotions and the realization of it all leaves you mind-blown for the rest of your life. It's really the perfect synthesis and love letter to the old mechas of the 70's and 80's, superbly well-handled. So much fun, manly, actiony, cartoony, hilarious and epic. After you're done you will remember it for the rest of your life."
1834,5.0,"This show is freaking amazing I'm a late fan to tracy i only knew of her because the simpsons came from her show on FOX. I Then fell in love with Tracy Takes On. Then I saw this show in target when i was buying Takes On Seasons 3 & 4. This show is great the DVD's Are fine I have seasons 1 & 2 BUT I wish they would release SEASON 3  I found this show when it was in it's 2nd season so I figured I would catch up when season 3 came out on dvd and then i would watch season 4 but there was no season 4 and now there is no season 3 dvd which sucks because I love this show and now i can't see how it ended

PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 3"
1835,2.0,"This series might have been OK, but the character Kicker is so freaking annoying that I want to slap him everytime he opens his mouth. What's worse is that everyone in the series tolerates his near constant tantrum-like behavior. The only character that comes close to his level of annoyance is his dad, especially that idiotic laugh of his.

With the exception of Megatron (and perhaps Shockblast and Starscream as well), the Transformers themselves are not very well portrayed either.

This series is so dull that I have yet to finish it, and I bought it nearly six months ago."
1836,5.0,"The final season of Malcolm in the Middle returns to the higher quality that was lacking for most episodes of the prior couple of seasons.  We still don't have Francis in most of these episodes and again he doesn't have his own separate storyline going on like he did with the initial seasons. For me the episodes on the first disc were some of the strongest ever.  The second disc episodes were around the quality of season 5 and 6 but the final disc episodes brought the quality of the show back to its heights again for the most part.

Season 7 starts off, as most first of the season episodes do, with a road trip.  This time Malcolm and Reese want to sneak off to Burning Man (an artsy festival in the desert), in the hopes of experiencing naked women.  They get caught but somehow in justifying how the trip there would have benefited their education and lives, the boys unwittingly convince Lois that the whole family should go. So Hal borrows an RV and the family drive there.  Of course Reese and Malcolm run off as soon as they arrive, but Dewey was too slow and is forced to help Hal set up.  Hal not really grasping what the festival is about has unbeknownst to him become an angry man performance exhibit. The crowds of gawkers cheering on his mistakes and outbursts, of course just make him madder. Lois embraces the hippy lifestyle, Malcolm falls in love with an older woman and Reese just wants to smash things but learns from a mentor that's not really what Burning Man is about.  It's a great episode both visually so and is very well written.

Other great moments on the first disc, include Hal realising he hasn't paid for health insurance and trying to avoid the family getting injured before the policy kicks in after the weekend, without Lois finding out of course.  Dewey gets caught smoking and Hal makes a deal, he'll give up coffee if Dewey gives up the smokes. Stevie becomes a candidate in a robotic walking frame program but Reese wants to beat him up.  The boys learn that their house was a murder scene before the family bought it, freaking out Hal.  Reese has an old army buddy come to visit who happens to be a hot female (even though we never saw her in season 5 or 6 when he was in the army). Even though Reese only sees her as his best friend, Malcolm convinces Reese she likes him and explains he'll never do any better so should hook up.  She has her own plans though for another family member. Hayden Panettiere also returns as Jessica for two episodes where in one episode she explains to Malcolm how she manipulates Lois to give her whatever she wants and of course Malcolm tries her method, meanwhile Reese asks Dewey to mail himself to China so he can beat up his pen pal who refuses to apologise for Pearl Harbour. This is one of Reese's finest episodes. In the other episode Jessica convinces Malcolm that his dream hottest girl of the school girlfriend who won't acknowledge their relationship to anyone else, isn't good for him.

Disc two episodes were a bit weaker but the highlights include Ida (Lois' mother) bringing over Raduca, a hot girl from her home country and telling Reese if he beats the weaker brother (Malcolm) at a number of challenges, as is the custom of their people, he'll get to marry the girl.  Malcolm of course morally objects to this so tries to win just to stop it from happening.  In the next episode the rest of the family learn that Reese has married her and the two live in the garage where  Raduca seems to have changed Reese into a better person.  Meanwhile Hal is being seduced by college recruiters who want Malcolm to attend their schools.

Hal makes friends with the neighbours when they learn Lois is confined to her room (with Malcolm) and won't possibly be joining them.  They try and set Hal up with a neighbour with Hal being oblivious to what is going on.

Disc three starts off with a great episode with Lois becoming a psychopath, going after four girls who humiliated Reese who thought had he had a hot date, which turned out to be a pig.  Even though Reese has done much worse to other kids up to this point, this is still fun to see Lois get revenge.  One of the high school girls is played by Emma Stone.

A mattress falls from the sky and Dewey and Malcolm realise they've never gotten a great nights sleep their whole lives.  Meanwhile Reese teaches Lois to ride a bike while Hal goes to war with his poker buddy dentist who offered to fix his tooth, then billed him for it.  In other episodes Hal goes to war with a young boy in a park who sinks his remote control boat because he was sitting on his bench.  Lois enters a keep your hand on a ute and win the thing if your the last to take it off contest leaving Hal to complete a list of chores but Reese and Dewey lock him in an bomb shelter they dug up while trying to bury something they broke.  Malcolm forms an anti prom committee while Reese is hired by a nerdy girl to be her prom date but must have a makeover.

Of course we have the final episode where Malcolm must give his graduation speech and learns that his mother has his whole life planned out for him when she turns down a six figure job offer from a tycoon who wanted to hire Malcolm and Stevie.  Meanwhile Reese who has moved in with Craig, wants to make the biggest mess ever at the school graduation to ensure he can become the school janitor.  Final episodes of successful shows never really meet expectations and it's fair to see this one didn't.  But you can always watch the alternative ending to Breaking Bad on that DVD and have that as the final episode."
1837,2.0,"Even with my wealth of experience suffering through many of the worst films ever made, I came pretty close to walking away from Retardead during the first half hour.  I bit the bullet and watched the whole lousy thing, but that that doesn't mean you have to.  I'm just going to come right out and say it, PC police be damned: Retardead is a freaking retarded movie.  Were it not for the antics and sarcasm of two incompetent deputies, this low-budget trash would have been all but unwatchable.  Even a gorehound like me gets tired of watching the same old low-budget, body-ripping, zombie cannibal shots of fake intestines being slurped up by the walking dead time after time after time.  And that whole thing of throwing tons of fake blood on the faces of the living -- yeah, that gets old, too, after about the twentieth time.

So, apparently, Retardead is the sequel to a film called Monsturd, which featured a mad scientist unleashing a ""poopman"" monster on the folks of Butte County.  Since that movie sounds even dumber than this one, don't look for a Monsturd review from me any time soon.  Anyway, Dr. Stein is back, more eager than ever to unleash his mad scientist skills on the dumb and the innocent.  The cops, sidetracked by the crimes of a serial sex pervert, don't even know the crazy doctor survived the first movie.  Stein soon lands a job at the local mental health clinic, which gives him the perfect place to continue developing his intelligence serum.  Alack and alas, he just can't eliminate those nasty side effects, and before you can say ""It's alive!  It's aliiiive!"" Butte County is suffering from a mass epidemic of zombie freaks.

Retardead is a zombie comedy; more precisely, it's a really dumb zombie movie.  The zombie makeup isn't all that bad, but the filmmakers' attempts to gross the audience out with tons of blood and gore become tiresome, especially since the special effects aren't convincingly realistic.  This film may well hold the record for the most splashes of blood to characters' faces.  As for the comedy, it falls flat much of the time because a lot of it just isn't funny and these aren't the greatest actors in the world.  Only the two deputies made me laugh consistently.  They're a great comedic duo - one is continually losing his cool, while the other is a master of sarcasm.  Those two alone almost make the movie worth watching -- almost."
1838,5.0,"There are just no words in the English language to describe how awesome and satisfying Gurren Laggan's ending is.

1839,4.0,"My daughter (who first saw this movie around age 2, she's now 3) loves Frances. I really wish this DVD were available for less than nearly $40. I have seen it going for around $72 at the most, which is ridiculous. We first discovered Frances when this movie was available on our Netflix streaming account. But they took it down, so we looked all over for a DVD we could purchase. Unfortunately this is expensive and way beyond our budget for something like a kid's DVD. They don't carry it at our library either, so we just rent the dvd from Netflix.

The DVD has autoplay (stick it in the dvd player and walk away, the feature plays without you making menu selections) and there's only one or two previews before the feature. After the feature there's a bonus episode of a show called Fifi and the Flowertots (I think it's somewhat popular in the UK) which I personally dislike but it's not inappropriate for children and some kids might enjoy it.

The movie is made up of three short stories, ""A Whiny Sister for Frances"", ""A Cupcake for Frances"", and ""Bedtime for Frances"". The stories are based on a series of books about Frances by Russell Hoban. Each episode has a lot of songs (to the tune of classical pieces, mostly) and dancing. They're pretty upbeat and teach some kind of lesson. Frances is a member of a family of badgers (a mom, dad, and toddler sister) and she is very much like a typical kid. She's a little whiney, but all kids whine at some point. While it may grate on your own nerves, kids do respond better to other kids who are like them and who they identify with. The animation is computer generated with lots of bright colors and movement, but the quality isn't so great at times.

In ""A Whiny Sister for Frances"", her sister Gloria gets the flu so the family can't go to 'Lizard Land' as they had planned. Frances is disappointed that her parents won't leave Gloria at home and just take Frances, but learns that it wouldn't be fun to go on a trip without Gloria.

In ""A Cupcake for Frances"", Frances' mother is giving a piano recital and making cupcakes for all the students in the recital. Frances wants two cupcakes, and while her mother isn't around she steals on belonging to her friend Albert. She also eats a ton of cupcake toppings when she's supposed to be decorating them. Frances justifies the theft in her own mind by being jealous of Albert spending time with Frances' mom, his piano teacher. Her parents find out that she stole a cupcake, but instead of flat out accusing her of stealing it and then punishing her, they leave it to her to work it out on her own. I guess to see if she will confess later after thinking about it. (Probably something I, as a parent, would only do after my child reached a certain age)

So Frances eventually realizes that what she did was wrong (she gets stomach-ache from all the sugar and I suppose it triggers her inner guilt, along with what her parents told her, plus she speaks with Albert and he is really friendly and sweet to her) and makes things right by giving her own cupcake to Albert. Instead of punishing her, her mom tells her that she's proud she did the right thing. Frances confesses to her mom that she had lied and in the end everything is okay.

I really disagree with the reviewer who said that Frances gets away with it. She felt guilt and made things right with Albert on her own, with little guidance from her parents. At a certain age, all kids should be able to do this. She confessed to her mom which would be humbling for any child, and I think it's good to praise a child for fixing their own mistakes after they do something wrong. Why should she be punished if she fixed things on her own? What would be the point? If she had just eaten the cupcake and and continued to lie, then that would be a reason for punishment and to teach her that lying and stealing is wrong, etc.

In ""Bedtime for Frances"", Frances doesn't want to go to bed. She ends up freaking herself out in a number of ways about things in the dark in her room (a tiger in the closet, a giant which is really a pile of dirty clothes, a crack in the ceiling, the wind blowing the curtains) and she's genuinely afraid. With the patience of sainthood, her parents gently help her get past her fears while reminding her that she needs to go to sleep. Finally her dad is just about on the edge of losing his patience with her, so he tells her that its her 'job' to go to bed so she'll be ready for school. He also says he'll be angry with her if she doesn't go to bed. In order to please her parents, Frances makes an effort to get over her fears and just go to sleep. When she wakes up in the morning she has a ton of energy and is happy.

I really feel like the lessons in each story are meant more for an elementary school child, maybe ages 6-8. Old enough to know the difference between right and wrong, concepts of honesty/truth and family love, and to independently brush their own teeth, go to their beds, lay down, and sleep. Most kids can't be expected to do these things or understand these concepts until they are at least in kindergarten or some short time after. However, the way the show is set up, the animation style, etc makes it seem like it's meant for a younger child like a toddler or preschooler. I somewhat doubt that the target audience would be interested in the show because of its production. Maybe they did this to make it more friendly for older and younger siblings to watch together? I don't know.

My daughter is entertained by this show so I allow her to watch it, but at her age I doubt she is actually learning anything from it because she is not developmentally ready to understand many of the concepts the creators were attempting to teach in these short stories."
1840,5.0,"What a freaking roller coaster ride!!! Love this movie, lots of action & twists & turns."
1841,3.0,"Championship Scramble ECW Championship Match: Tommy Dreamer (Champion) vs. Christian vs. Finlay vs. Jack Swagger vs. Mark Henry (with Tony Atlas)
I enjoy this kind of match, though Christian and Swagger started out kind of slow since we've seen them wrestle against one another three straight pay-per-views in a row. Finlay and Tommy Dreamer added a lot to the match and made it the most exciting, though Mark Henry didn't do too bad of a job. Towards the end of the match, Dreamer managed to pin Christian following a Dreamer DDT, and then everything just got a bit sloppy, and the lack of any weapon usage was a bit disappointing considering it is technically a No Disqualification Match, but overall, it serves as a good opener and a fairly entertaining and interesting match. Winner: Tommy Dreamer. Match Rating: 4/5

Mask vs. Title Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho (Champion) vs. Rey Mysterio
Another classic match-up from these two. There was a ton of back-and-forth action, though things started out kind of slow. Jericho whipped Mysterio head-first into the security barricade and then the action went into Jericho's favor as he kept countering all of Mysterio's moves. Mysterio regained the advantage soon enough though, but missed a 619 attempt. Mysterio hit a series of high-impact moves like a tornado DDT though Jericho continuously kicked out. At one point, they both kept rolling each other up, and then Mysterio kicked out of a Lionsault by Jericho. Mysterio powered out of the Walls of Jericho twice, which Jericho applied after countering a hurracanrana, though Jericho countered a springboard crossbody into a Codebreaker. Mysterio STILL kicked out, though when Jericho tried for a Super Codebreaker, Mysterio pushed him off the top turnbuckle and jumped at him. Jericho ripped off his mask, but Mysterio had another mask on underneath! Mysterio hit a running insiguri on Jericho, followed by the 619, and capped off with the Swan Dive to get the victory and the IC title. Winner: Rey Mysterio Match Rating: 5/5

No Disqualification Match: Dolph Ziggler vs. The Great Khali (with Ranjin Singh)
Ziggler's pay-per-view debut is a No DQ Match against Khali. Not the best odds I'd say. Regardless, Khali was relentless in his attacks, chopping Ziggler so hard that it made the poor guy fall to the ground. When the fight spilled to the outside when Khali dumped Ziggler over the top turnbuckle, Ziggler dodged a chop that sent Khali's hand SMASHING into the steel ring post. This gave Ziggler the advantage, who hit some pretty unique offensive maneuvers, including a Fameasser, before Khali started getting the advantage again. Ziggler brought a steel chair into the ring and went to attack Khali, but Khali punched it away. Khali chopped Ziggler down and called for the Chokeslam, but then Kane suddenly entered the arena! Kane grabbed a chair and beat Khali down with it, capping off his assault with a chairshot to the skull. This gave Ziggler the opportunity to pin Khali. Not very exciting or amazing, but it was still entertaining with some nice chair shots to see. Winner: Dolph Ziggler. Match Rating: 4/5

Triple Threat Unified WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Carlito and Primo (Champions) vs. Chris Jericho and Edge vs. Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase)
Edge was pissed that he wasn't on the pay-per-view card and Chris Jericho was pissed about losing to Mysterio yet again, so Theodore Long made this match triple threat. While it was hardly a triple threat match, with Jericho and Edge being in the match for mere seconds, it was still a good showing by Carlito, Primo, and Legacy. Primo was grounded for most of the match though, which was a shame and a bad move by the competitors in my opinion. The match got a bit confusing during the end, but what happened was Edge got the pin on Cody Rhodes while Jericho brawled with Primo and DiBiase on the outside. Carlito didn't know that Edge was the legal man and hit the Backstabber, followed by a cover. When Carlito turned around, he ate a Spear from Edge, who then pinned Carlito to win the titles. The ending was confusing and the match wasn't really what it was advertised to have been, but it was still quite entertaining. Winners: Chris Jericho and Edge. Match Rating: 4/5

Women's Championship Match: Michelle McCool (Champion) vs. Melina
This match was okay. There wasn't really anything of note that happened, just some basic women's offense from both competitors, and nothing we haven't seen before. Michelle McCool managed to pick up the win without much of a battle after hitting the Faithbreaker (or whatever it's called nowadays) on Melina to end the ""eh"" match in a particular sweet fashion. Winner: Michelle McCool. Match Rating: 3/5

World Heavyweight Championship Match: CM Punk (Champion) vs. Jeff Hardy
This match was actually very well done. Both men hit their usual offense, with Jeff being grounded for part of the match thanks to Punk's submission holds. Punk even pulled out some pretty interesting submissions, including a Figure Four Head Lock (no joke). Hardy hit the Twist of Fate and even the Swanton Bomb, after powering out of the Go To Sleep attempts by CM Punk, but Punk's foot was under the rope, which is a technical rope break. A frustrated Hardy tried to attack Punk some more, but Punk hid behind the referee after a short struggle and then kicked the referee in the side, prompting the ref to call for the disqualification and end the match in a very poor manner. Winner: Jeff Hardy. Match Rating: 4/5

John Cena vs. The Miz
Another bad match from John Cena. Go figure. Anyway, Cena was actually dominated for the majority of the match, with Miz hitting some nice offense moves as well as some high-flying stuff. The match did drag on like crazy during this portion though, with Miz applying very boring submission holds and hitting Cena with basic strikes. In the end, Cena hit the ""Attitude Adjustment"" (yes, they changed the freaking name of the only thing Cena was really good for), and then applied the STF, forcing Miz to submit. Lame match with a lame ending. Winner: John Cena Match Rating: 2/5

Three Stages of Hell WWE Championship Match: Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Triple H
The only real problem with this match is that Triple H and Orton have wrestled a ridiculous amount of times over the last few years and that the match ends up not being what was advertised. Regardless, the match starts out as a regular wrestling match, with some nice offense and signature stuff from both men. However, Triple H nailed Orton in the head with a steel chair out of nowhere to give Orton the win via disqualification for the first fall. This gave Triple H the advantage though during the Falls Count Anywhere Match that followed. Triple H beat up on Orton with the steel chair and then hit a Pedigree on the outside to get the pinfall! The stretcher match was a little more exciting, with brawling all over the arena and some wicked shots into the security barricade and such. Towards the end of the match, Triple H hit the Pedigree to Orton on the steel and nearly had him rolled over the line, but Cody Rhodes ran out! Rhodes prevented Triple H from making it across, but Triple H quickly eliminated Rhodes from the competition. Just when Triple H was about to win again, Ted DiBiase ran out, prevented Triple H from winning, and then he and Rhodes beat up on Triple H. However, Triple H pulled a steel grating off the stage floor and pulled out his sledgehammer! Triple H went to town on Legacy, hitting them with his sledgehammer multiple times, but Orton smacked the steel grating Triple H took off the floor right onto The Game's head. This knocked Triple H unconscious and gave Orton the chance to roll him over the line and retain his title. An angry Triple H then nailed Orton in the face with the sledgehammer after the match. This is a greatly entertaining match with the perfect pace, but there is a serious problem with the lack of brutality here. Winner: Randy Orton Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
The Bash was okay. It wasn't as good as a pay-per-view should be, but it wasn't really disappointing either. The Cena/Miz match was a big letdown, though the main event did deliver, and the rest of the card was pretty good, save for the average women's match. It's not going to win any awards, but it was still an interesting pay-per-view that just fell short of being something you would want to spend your money on without blinking an eye."
1842,4.0,"Even though this film was made in 2009 (under the shooting title ""The Birthday Party""), it got very spotty distribution besides a few film festivals, even though those who have seen it have given it great reviews. Hell, you still can only buy it on a Made-on-Demand DVD-R (No big deal for me, but I know it's a turn-off by ""purists"", even though the anamorphic widescreen print looks amazing. Try Amazon to get a MOD copy. They are the exclusive distributors.). I think it's a wonderful film to add to your library, no matter which format it is released on. The film begins with Aaron (Henry Thomas; E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL - 1982; DEAD BIRDS - 2004) trying to do some work in his apartment, but every night he has to put up with the screaming arguments and throwing objects tantrums of his next-door neighbors, Linda (Kelli Garner; HORNS - 2013) and Kyle (Jordan Hagan). The walls are thin, so Aaron can hear everything and it's impossible for him to get things done. Aaron meets Linda at the local laundromat, where their conversation about what he hears through his walls gets contentious at times (Aaron tells her, ""PlayStations don't cry, Linda!""). They both seem to get a thrill putting each other down (Aaron is sporting a black eye, but he refuses to tell Linda how he got it.).
They decide to have lunch together at the local Thai restaurant, where they continue their adversarial conversation, until Aaron tells her that he is a storyteller. As we watch the Thai cook squish a cockroach on the cooking grill as she flicks it away with her cooking utensils (which is why I don't eat Thai food!), Aaron tells Linda a story. It is about a family of four, the father (S.A. Griffin; NEAR DARK - 1987), daughter (Carli Westerman; KING OF THE ANTS - 2003) and son (Austin Whitlock) sitting around a dinner table, while they hear their crazy wife/mother (Carol Ann Susi; best known for her portrayal of the voice of recurring unseen character Mrs. Wolowitz on the television series THE BIG BANG THEORY; she passed away on November 11, 2014), who Dad say is off her meds, complaining about how her family doesn't appreciate her. She comes out of the kitchen with a spaghetti dinner and serves it to them with her hands, still complaining that her family takes advantage of her (she's quite scary, actually). She threatens her son with bodily harm, but Dad warns her not to touch him. She stares at her son and says, ""They won't be around forever. Just you wait. Just you wait!"" That night, Dad, aided by his son and daughter, suffocate her with a pillow while she is sleeping in bed and then just stand there, looking at the twisted face on her corpse. Linda is not impressed with Aaron's story because it is not ""horrific"" enough, so he tells her another story about a ninja that cuts off the female Thai's cook's head and cooks it, the severed head saying while it is cooking in the wok, ""It needs a little more fish salt!"" (There's an ingenious little moment where, when the cook's head is cut off, the blood splatters on a photo of a Thai pop star. We see the photo come to life as he looks at all the blood on his clothes! This film is full of those little moments.). When the ninja takes off the face covering, it turns out to be Linda, but even that story doesn't cheer her up because she wants to go to a party in a secluded cabin in the woods with her friends to celebrate a birthday, but Kyle won't let her borrow the car to drive there.
Aaron says he will make a ""custom"" story for Linda about the party she is going to miss, but he needs some background information first, including where the secluded cabin is located, the names of her friends who will be there (including birthday boy Frank [Bret Roberts; THE VIOLENT KIND - 2010] and Linda's sister Pat [Cristen Coppen; STAUNTON HILL - 2009]). With that information, Aaron begins to tell her his story, but the story keeps on changing due to Linda's constant interruptions of descriptions of her friends' looks and what type of cars they drive. Aaron continues telling his story, where Frank enters the cabin with Pat and everyone begins to party, but he is interrupted again, this time by the female Thai waitress, who says that she has seen Linda before. Aaron gets back to his story, but now Frank and the gang are heading to the local lake to do some swimming and rafting. Frank stops the story and says a story like this needs a maniac to crash the party, so he asks Linda to help him create the perfect maniac for the story. They come up with some weird ideas, like a maniac totally in blackface and another maniac with a toaster on his head (we see these maniacs on-screen and they are quite funny). They almost come up with a perfect maniac with a guy with a stocking over his head wrapped with barb wire, but they finally settle on a maniac wearing a black a ski mask with bunny ears, a Polaroid camera attached to the top of his head (so he can take photos of his dead victims), dressed in a one-piece white uniform (the kind that has a long zipper in the front) with a pink tool belt (that last one was Linda's idea).
While Frank and his friends are having fun at the lake, Jon (Kevin Wheatley; RISE: BLOOD HUNTER - 2006) returns to the cabin to pick up a CD player so they can listen to some tunes. The maniac wraps a thick wire around Jon's neck and strangles him until the CD player is pressed up against his ear. Linda is not too pleased that her friends are getting killed in the story, but Aaron convinces her that it will improve his story and Linda says, ""Death is too good for them!"", so Aaron continues his story. But before he can tell any more, the waitress brings the check and Linda heads back to the laundromat to fold her laundry (Aaron yells out, ""Kyle's a hobby. I'm for real!""). Aaron meets Linda back at the laundromat (where she teaches him how to properly fold clothes) and he tells Linda that if she really wants to be at the party, she would find a way to get there. Aaron tells Linda that he has a vision of Kyle, where he almost chokes to death on popcorn while watching sports on TV, almost gets stabbed by a butcher knife when he falls to the floor and the knife drops off the counter and then electrocutes himself by sticking a fork in a toaster. Linda laughs at Kyle's death in the story, but says he hasn't suffered enough, so Aaron embellishes on the story where Kyle falls down and a 5 gallon water bottle full of loose change gets lodged in his mouth, him swallowing all the coins (Believe me when I say that everything I have so far described will make sense. Just be patient.).
Linda makes Aaron finish the story about the maniac loose at the party, where we see nerd Roy (Eric Jungmann; Director Robert Englund's KILLER PAD - 2008) spying on a totally nude Frank and equally nude Jenny (Michele Nordin; ANCIENT EVIL: SCREAM OF THE MUMMY - 1999) having sex in the woods. The maniac stabs Roy over and over on his back, while Frank heads back to the lake. Jenny, who knew Roy was watching them, stays behind to give Roy a treat, but when she discovers his bloody body wedged between a fork in a tree, the maniac beheads her with an axe and her head goes flying through the air.
Linda thinks it's a clich that people in horror films and stories always get killed for having sex (it is) and she tells Aaron that Frank is actually gay, so he has to make a change to his story. This time, Roy and Jenny are stuck in a hole in the ground when someone throws them a rope. The only problem is that the other end the rope is tied around the neck of an alligator and, as they try to climb the rope, the alligator inches closer and closer to the hole, finally falling in and killing Roy and Jenny. The rest of the friends are back at the cabin when Franks decides to go looking for Jon (not knowing that he is already dead) and runs into Ken (Ryan Doom; CIRCLE - 2010), who is also gay. Frank ties himself up to a hook in the shed so he and Ken can participate in some S&M action. They engage in some kissing and foreplay when the maniac shows up and plays ""Happy Birthday"" on a huge tree saw (the kind it takes two people to use). The maniac then plants the saw in the top of Ken's head and cuts him vertically in half (the film's most graphic death). The blood sprays all over a tied-up Frank's body, but the maniac just takes a Polaroid of Ken's cleaved-in-two corpse and leaves Frank hanging. The last two people in the cabin, Pat and Amy (Natalia Baron) are dancing when Linda cuts off the story, carrying her folded laundry to to her apartment building, where she and Aaron share an elevator to their apartments.
Kyle has left their apartment a mess and is not there, so Linda goes to Aaron's apartment to complain that even though Kyle won't let her go to the party, he has bailed on her for the night. Aaron says the best revenge is that he drives her to the party to p**s-off Kyle. Linda races back to her apartment to get all dolled-up (something tells me it's more for Aaron than for her friends) and Aaron then begins to drive to the cabin, where the two discuss the real meaning of ""rub it in"" and that when a vegetarian takes a s**t, it's smellier than one who eats meat (that, too, is true). On the drive, Aaron finishes the party story, where Amy is freaking out about their missing friends (she says that maybe they all fell down a well and alligators ate them!). Pat and Amy leave the cabin to go look for their friends and end up on a fog-filled dock, where they hear someone whistling a catcall. Thinking it is their friends playing a prank on them, they soon realize their mistake, as they run into the maniac and their friends' dead bodies. They try to escape in a tinkered-with car, while the maniac takes a Polaroid of them (every time the maniac takes a photo, the background twirls around like a panel in a comic book). They leave the car, but the maniac bashes in Amy's head to a bloody pulp with two hammers, one in each hand (it's another really gory scene).
Linda once again interrupts and warns Aaron that he better not kill off his sister in the story, so we see Pat slug the maniac and tackle him into the lake and pulls off his ski mask. The maniac is Aaron and he drowns because of the weight of the pink toolbelt. When Aaron and Linda actually make it to the cabin, they notice that it is very quiet and then hear a woman scream in the cabin. Aaron goes to investigate, but when he doesn't come back, Linda goes into the cabin and discovers that the maniac holding a knife to Aaron's throat, so she kills the maniac with a claw hammer, only to find out it is her sister Pat. It seems Aaron was already at the cabin (remember, the walls that separates his and Linda's apartment are thin) and killed everyone there except Pat, who he left tied-up as a patsy (Remember Aaron's black eye? Pat gave it to him when she punched him into the lake.), but Kyle is now there as a surprise for Linda and beats up Aaron to a bloody pulp. But when Kyle and Linda go to leave the cabin, they open the door to find the ground covered in loose change and coins come pouring out of Kyle's mouth (think back), killing him. The film ends with Aaron burying all the bodies (including Linda alive) and returning to his apartment, where he thinks he will finally have peace and quiet at last. But one final surprise is in store as we discover that Aaron was the son that helped his family suffocate his mother and her ghost appears in his apartment to torment him forever.
This filmed-in-Los Angeles horror film has the same kind of structure as the cult hit TRICK 'R TREAT (2007), where we think every story is not related, but, in the end, we discover that they are all interconnected. This is the first fictional feature film by director Bruce Dickson, who also photographed and co-produced the horror film STITCH in 2014 and, for a first feature, it is damn good. The idea of making up stories on the fly is as old as storytelling itself, but this film infuses new blood into the concept, as they are not made-up stories at all, but actually the truth and Dickson fills the story with great dialogue between Aaron and Linda (supplied by screenwriters Anthony Burns and Joe Moe [who is also a producer]), some very graphic bloodshed and copious nudity. Henry Thomas is superb here, as we get the feeling that there is something seriously wrong with him, but we just can't put our finger on it. I generally don't like anthologies, but this really isn't one, as the stories change on a whim and end with quite a surprise (the only thing I'm not sure of is how the beheading of the Thai cook connects with anything, but I'm going to watch it again because there is a lot going on in this film that I may have missed). This is also final cameo appearance of Forrest J. Ackerman, but you'll have to be quick in spotting him early in the film (He gets a ""Thanks"" in the final credits, too). Recommended to people who like their films on the weird and slightly perverted side. Also starring Dina Lynne Morishita as the Thai waitress/cook and Steven Skyler as the Thai Pop Idol who gets blood spilled on his photograph. Also featuring Earl Roesel, Lateef Crowder and Lewis Tan as the various incarnations of the maniacs we are shown on screen. The DVD-R also contains a lot of extras and is well worth owning for $14.99. Most people think this is a 2008 production, but it has a 2009 copyright date at the end credits. A 3 Mac Studios DVD-R Release. Not Rated and for good reason."
1843,4.0,"I was amazed by Slammiversary, horridly disappointed by Victory Road, and as a result, I don't know what to expect coming into Hard Justice 2009. Since all the matches are under hardcore rules, the X-Division is represented, and D'Angelo Dinero (a.k.a Elijah Burke from WWE) is making his TNA debut in the Steel Asylum Match, I have a good feeling about this...

Steel Asylum #1 Contender's TNA X-Division Championship Match: Alex Shelley vs. Chris Sabin vs. Consequences Creed vs. Daniels vs. D'Angelo Dinero vs. Jay Lethal vs. Suicide vs. The Amazing Red
This match was freaking amazing, and so far, the match of the night (yes, hilarious joke since it is the first match). There wasn't even a second in the match where it wasn't absolutely exciting. Everyone did their part, with plenty of high action and unique double-team moves that prove that The Motor City Machineguns and Lethal Consequences need to get into the tag team picture soon. Amazing Red also proved his worth by falling off the top of the asylum and also hitting a hurracanrana...INTO A DDT WITH HIS FRIGGIN' LEGS! There were a few spots where a bunch of wrestlers would be up on the top turnbuckle and then they'd hit a giant move on each other all at the same time. A particularly impressive moment came when Suicide was super German suplexed off of the top turnbuckle and right into a bunch of other contestants! Alex Shelley got his face SMASHED into the asylum, and D'Angelo Dinero, formerly known as Elijah Burke in WWE, was also pretty impressive in his TNA debut match. He hit a Spear off the top ropes onto Daniels that came out of nowhere, and he also took a super STO from Daniels. Phenomenal match with a strange ending. Dinero, or ""The Pope"" as they're calling him, could've won the match, but he decided to attack Suicide, and he threw Suicide into the steel asylum in a sickening manner, giving Daniels the opportunity to climb out and win. PHENOMENAL match that should be seen by any TNA and any wrestling fan in general. Thank God they improved from last month and had the X-Division! Daniels is the #1 contender now. Winner: Daniels. Match Rating: 5/5

Hardcore Bounty Match: Abyss vs. Jethro Holliday (with Dr. Stevie)
Jethro Holliday, previously known as Trevor Murdoch in the WWE, has taken up on Dr. Stevie's offer to pay $50,000 to anyone who can beat Abyss. The match actually started out as a straight-wrestling contest, which was actually quite exciting. There was some psychology carried over from Victory Road with Holliday using the stick thing that Stevie used last month. When chairs got involved though, Holliday countered a move by Abyss to send the chair RIGHT into Abyss's crotch! Holliday would later get his head smashed into a chair set up in the turnbuckles, similarly to the fate that Stevie had last month as well. Got to love that kind of psychology in a hardcore match. Amazingly, Holliday kicked out of the Chokeslam, and using Stevie's distraction, got the advantage on Abyss. Holliday got ready with a pair of brass knuckles, only to have Abyss, predictably, counter it with the Black Hole Slam for the win. Pretty good match I suppose, but it was too short. After the match, Stevie got pissed off at Holliday, to which Holliday responded to by beating up on Stevie. Winner: Abyss. Match Rating: 4/5

Hardcore TNA World Heavyweight Championship Feast or Fired Briefcase Match: Big Rob (with The British Invasion) vs. Hernandez
What the hell? Instead of actually giving us a match, they gave us...eh, I'll get to it later. The British Invasion stole the briefcase from Hernandez, which guarantees a title shot at the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at any time, similarly to the Money in the Bank deal in WWE. Regardless, the match started out with Hernandez tricking Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams into hitting Big Rob after powering out of a full-nelson applied by Rob (by the way, last month, ""Big Rob"" was known as Rob Terry...don't ask me what happened). Hernandez then hit a running shoulder block to...get the FREAKING pin. A joke match, but at least it wasn't a bad match that ran on forever. Winner: Hernandez. Match Rating: 2/5

IWGP Tag Team Championship Match: The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams) (Champions) vs. Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm)
Apparently, TNA management changed their mind about the ""every match is a hardcore match"" stipulation, because there were a ton of moments in this match that clearly contradicted that previous statement. Disappointing, but the match was still actually quite good. Beer Money was the highlight, obviously, with plenty of exciting tag team offense. Magnus and Williams still botched a few moves here and there, unfortunately, but there was still some good moments with them. One particular spot was where either Magnus or Williams was in the tree of woe, and then Roode and Storm dragged his partner's crotch RIGHT into his face, which then caused him to fall out of the tree of woe, onto his partner (I have a hard time telling Williams and Magnus apart...hehe) in a 69 position! Beer Money was about to hit the DWI, but Eric Young, who was doing commentary, slid a title belt in and distracted the referee. This gave Williams and Magnus the opportunity to hit Roode with the title belt and retain the titles as Storm chased off Young. Good match, but they completely ignored the stipulation of the night. Winners: The British Invasion. Match Rating: 4/5

Special Stipulations Tag Team TNA Women's Knockout Championship Match: Angelina Love (Champion) and Velvet Sky (with Madison Rayne) vs. ODB and Cody Deaner
Yet another match that completely ignores the ""hardcore"" rules. It's a shame though, considering we know that women can actually put on good hardcore matches, especially in TNA with Taylor Wilde and Daffney. It'd be interesting to see more of that. Anyway, the special stipulation here was that if ODB or Deaner get the pin, ODB becomes champion. If Love or Sky get the pin, then Love retains the title. Love and ODB put on a decent match for a little while, with some basic offense, but when Sky and Deaner got in, Deaner started spanking Sky so hard her entire ass was a dark red. As the match progressed, Deaner kissed Love, Sky, AND Rayne, but when Sky countered a...hump attempt by holding onto Deaner so Rayne could spray him in the face with the hairspray (the referee was distracted by ODB and Love brawling), Deaner ducked, and Sky got it in the face! Deaner then rolled Sky up for the victory! It was ""eh"" really, with just enough spunk that I'm not going to take it down a notch. Honestly, ODB vs. Love would have been better, but oh well. After the match, Deaner ran off with the title, thinking he deserved it, and Sky and Love almost attacked Rayne, but the referee held them back. Winners: ODB and Cody Deaner. Match Rating: 4/5

TNA X-Division Championship Match: Homicide (Champion) vs. Samoa Joe (with Taz)
A fast-paced and exciting match that was actually quite good and ANOTHER great match. There was a ton of high-flying action and plenty of exciting spots, with Joe hitting suplexes on Homicide and Homicide hitting some impressive offense on Joe that included a sick neckbreaker and a cutter. Joe, at one point, applied a bunch of different submissions on Homicide in succession, including the Crossface, but Homicide later powered out of the Coquina Clutch. Joe hit his signature suicide dive and Homicide flipped THROUGH the middle rope and onto Joe at another point, but Taz distracted Homicide long enough for Joe to recover. Back in the ring, Joe locked in the Coquina Clutch and countered a takedown pin attempt by Homicide to add a body scissors, forcing Homicide to tap out. It was short, fast, and exciting as hell. This is what TNA is all about. Winner: Samoa Joe. Match Rating: 5/5

Hardcore TNA World Tag Team Championship Match: The Main Event Mafia (Booker T and Scott Steiner) (Champions) vs. Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon)
ANOTHER phenomenal match. The match started off as a brawl, and then spilled into the crowd. Scott Steiner nailed a flying clothesline OFF a cement barricade down quite a bit onto Brother Ray on the cement floor. There were plenty of chair shots on Brother Ray as well, while Devon dominated Booker T for most of the match, and even slammed him on the outside. When the fight went back into the ring, Team 3D had the advantage, though Booker saved Steiner from getting a Doomsday Device through a table! Ray then received a Book End through the table, and MEM had the advantage from there on. Booker missed the Axe Kick, which allowed Devon and Ray to hit the 3D!!! However, Steiner rolled Ray up just as Devon pinned Booker, and the two referees involved in the contest made simultaneous counts! Per referee decision, MEM was declared the winner!!! An awesome hardcore brawl that was just as exciting psychologically wise as it was hardcore wise. Winners: The Main Event Mafia. Match Rating: 5/5

Hardcore TNA Legends Championship Match: Mick Foley (Champion) vs. Kevin Nash
Could it be? Yet ANOTHER perfect match? Well, not quite. It was almost there, though. This was a straight brawl, with action on the outside, chair shots, and a unique counter at one point when Foley went for his elbow drop off the apron, only to have a chair thrown at his elbow, causing his fist to jab into his eye and bust him open EVERYWHERE. Nash got busted open when his face was slammed onto the steel steps. Foley pulled out the barbed wire baseball bat, but then Traci ran down to the ring and jumped on the apron. Nash hit the Big Boot on Foley, causing Foley to knock Traci off the apron (Traci used to manage Beer Money, Inc. and she's in The Main Event Mafia nowadays), and then Nash got the pinfall. Too short with a weak ending, but it was still highly entertaining. Afterwards, Abyss ran out with a barbed wire baseball bat to protect Foley from Nash. Winner: Kevin Nash. Match Rating: 4/5

Three Way TNA World Heavyweight Championship Match: Kurt Angle (Champion) vs. Matt Morgan vs. Sting
I used to hate Matt Morgan before this match. After this match, I respect him as a performer and a wrestler and I hope to see him in more main events after this. Everyone did their signature stuff, and Sting actually dominated both men for quite a while in the early portion of the match. Morgan and Angle were on the same side and double-teamed Sting for a while, but then when Sting threw Morgan into the ropes, Angle pulled the ropes down and Morgan fell to the concrete! A pissed off Morgan then started fighting Angle, and he hit the Carbon Footprint on Angle! In the ring, Sting kicked out of an Angle Slam and a Carbon Footprint!!! Sting then hit the Scorpion Death Drop on Morgan, but MORGAN KICKED OUT!!! I'm not even kidding. Angle tried to lock on the Ankle Lock on Sting, but Sting locked on the Scorpion Death Lock on Morgan. Sting countered the Angle Slam into an arm drag that was done beautifully. Morgan hit another Carbon Footprint on Sting, but as he was about to win, Angle pulled the referee out of the ring! Carrying a steel chair into the ring, Angle SMASHED it on Morgan's head, tossed Sting out of the ring, and then pinned Morgan!!! Awesome match!!! Matt Morgan has really proved himself. Please, please, please Angle vs. Morgan at No Surrender! Winner: Kurt Angle. Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
Hard Justice, to put it simply, was AWESOME. There was only one weak match, that being the ""match"" with Hernandez and Big Rob. The rest of the card was phenomenal, and I can't wait for their next pay-per-view. I hope it doesn't disappoint like Victory Road did."
1844,5.0,"Ultimate X TNA X-Division Championship Match: The Amazing Red (Champion) vs. Alex Shelley vs. Chris Sabin vs. Daniels vs. Homicide vs. Suicide
A phenomenal opener. The match was fast-paced and intense throughout the entire thing, with so many spots that it was mind boggling. There were suicide dives and people being sent outside of the ring a lot at the beginning, until the only two remaining competitors were The Amazing Red and Daniels. Red took Daniels to the outside with a hurracanrana on top of everyone else! Everyone hit their signature offense throughout the match and their finishing moves, and Homicide hit a Gringo Cutter on Suicide from off the freaking Ultimate X ropes! There was one spot where a bunch of the guys were on the top ropes and there was a German suplex/superplex/powerbomb/Pele Kick combination that has to bee seen to be believed. Towards the end of the match, Red, Daniels, and Suicide were all on the Ultimate X ropes, and Suicide hit a freaking Suicide Solution OFF the ropes and onto the mat below on Daniels! Red took this opportunity to ward off Sabin and Shelley, who had just taken out Homicide, and grab the Championship to retain! Winner: The Amazing Red. Match Rating: 5/5

TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship Match: Sarita and Taylor Wilde (Champions) vs. The Beautiful People (Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky)
Short and not so sweet. Lacey Von Erich was ejected from the match early on after a bunch of making out occured between her and a couple of referees. The match was rather short, with Sarita and Taylor dominating Sky at first. Sky fought back and got Rayne mixed into the action, which worked out well until Sarita hit some high impact offense and got Taylor in the ring. There was a bit of confusion with both of The Beautiful People in the ring at the same time, which allowed Sarita to hit an awesome missile dropkick on Sky to send her out of the ring. Taylor then set up Rayne, and they hit their tag team maneuver to pin Rayne to retain their titles. Winners: Sarita and Taylor Wilde. Match Rating: 3/5

Three Way Legends Championship Match: Kevin Nash (Champion) vs. Eric Young vs. Hernandez
Pretty good match, and a pretty big improvement over the previous match. Nash and Young double-teamed Hernandez pretty much the whole time. Young even managed to counter a suplex attempt by Hernandez thanks to Nash attacking Hernandez. Young then followed it up with a suplex of his OWN! Hernandez had bursts of offense that included his basic stuff. Nash started to become weary of Young when he went for a pinfall, but Young was sent to the outside by Hernandez shortly after. Nash threw Hernandez towards the ropes, but Hernandez hit a freaking suicide dive OVER the top rope and onto Young! As the match continued, Hernandez hit a sit-out powerbomb on Young that almost won him the match, but Nash broke up the pin at the last second. Young and Nash started beating down Hernandez again, and when Nash went for a Jackknife Powerbomb, Young knocked Hernandez into Nash's crotch! This allowed Young to pin Nash and win the title. Winner: Eric Young. Match Rating: 4/5

Full Metal Mayhem TNA World Tag Team and IWGP Tag Team Championships Match: The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams) (IWGP Tag Team Champions) vs. The Main Event Mafia (Booker T and Scott Steiner) (TNA World Tag Team Champions) vs. Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) vs. Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray)
BRUTAL as HELL. There were still some weak chair shots, but there were also some extremely strong chair shots that made you cringe. Everyone hit their signature moves, and the entire thing was a technical tag team clinic. Tables were broken everywhere, with Team 3D Chokeslamming people through tables and Scott Steiner was even double powerbombed through a table off a ladder by Team 3D. Team 3D managed to pull down the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but their victory was short-lived as Rhino ran out and attacked them with a steel chair! Booker T was taken away on a stretcher, leaving the only teams being British Invasion and Beer Money left! Beer Money were about to win, but then Big Rob came out and MILITARY PRESS SLAMMED ROBERT ROODE OUT OF THE RING AND THROUGH A TABLE AT RINGSIDE!!! Rob then carried Magnus on his shoulders to grab the title while Williams kept James Storm down. Winners: Team 3D and The British Invasion. Match Rating: 5/5

Three Way TNA Women's Knockout Championship Match: ODB (Champion) vs. Awesome Kong vs. Tara
An epic women's encounter! ODB and Tara double-teamed Kong at first, hitting a double suplex on her and continuously hitting her with power moves. ODB and Tara started fighting though, which led to some stiff shots and Tara debuting a new move that she borrowed from Tajiri...the Tarantula! Kong broke up the submission hold by splashing ODB, which sent Tara to the outside. As Kong dominated ODB, Tara was distracted by something and then went backstage. Kong and ODB continued their match. ODB managed to hit a Samoan drop on Kong (no joke), but Kong managed to recover and get ODB on the mat. Tara returned to the ring and tried to get involved, but Kong knocked her off the apron. Kong then hit a splash off the second rope on ODB, and Tara just barely broke the count. Kong tossed Tara back to the outside again and then hit the Implant Buster on ODB!!! ODB KICKED OUT OF THE IMPLANT BUSTER! Raisha Saeed, Kong's handler, ran out to the ring and tossed a steel chair into the ring. Kong kicked the chair out of the ring, but Saeed threw it back into the ring just as Kong was about to do a powerbomb on ODB. ODB countered in mid-air and hit a Cutter on Kong on the steel chair to retain her title! Winner: ODB. Match Rating: 5/5

Submission Match: Bobby Lashley vs. Samoa Joe
Surprisingly, this match was awesome as hell. Joe and Lashley started out applying a bunch of different submission holds to each other, and then they started with some straight wrestling. Joe then LEAP FROGGED over Lashley went he went for a Spear! Joe took advantage and started focusing on Lashley's injured ribs. They went to the outside, where Joe utilized the ring and the security barricade to hurt Lashley. Back in the ring, Joe hit a series of suplexes and not one, but TWO Rock Bottom moves on Lashley. Joe applied some submission holds, but Lashley fought out of them. Joe coreographed more leap frog attempts by Lashley by jabbing him in the thumb and hitting some more power moves. Joe went for a third Rock Bottom, but Lashley tripped him and applied...THE COQUINA CLUTCH!!! Samoa Joe passed out, and Lashley won! Winner: Bobby Lashley. Match Rating: 5/5

Special Stipulations Special Guest Referee Monster's Ball Match: Abyss vs. Mick Foley (with Special Guest Referee Dr. Stevie)
They screwed up majorly in the middle of the match, but it was still amazing. This match will be a match to remember forever. A pure classic. It started out with Foley ambushing Abyss during his entrance. Foley hit Abyss with a neckbreaker and then tried to climb the scaffolding on the stage, but Abyss followed! Foley punched Abyss off the scaffolding, who FELL THROUGH THE STAGE!!! Foley followed this up with a flying elbow drop off the normal part of the stage onto the broken part with the barbed wire baseball bat!!! Stevie helped Foley back to the ring, but Abyss suddenly broke out...OF THE MIDDLE OF THE RAMP!!! Abyss headed to the ring, and then it turned into madness. Abyss tried to Chokeslam Foley onto a board with barbed wire, but Foley countered into his Double-Arm DDT onto the barbed wire!!! Meanwhile, Dr. Stevie set up another barbed wire board bridge-style between the security barricade and the ring. In the ring though, Foley started to work over Abyss by SWINGING the barbed wire bat at his arm! Foley then tried to throw Abyss into the a barbed wire board set in the corner, but Abyss countered and Foley was sent into the board! Abyss went for a splash, but Foley moved out of the way and Abyss smashed into the barbed wire! Foley and Dr. Stevie then sandwiched Abyss between the two barbed wire boards! Foley then brought out the thumbtacks that he banned Abyss from using, but before he could slam Abyss on them, Abyss recovered and went for a Chokeslam! Dr. Stevie reminded him that if he used the thumbtacks, he would be disqualified. Abyss responded by hitting the Electric Shock Treatment on Stevie! Daffney ran down to ringside and slid Foley a taser, which Foley subsequently used on Abyss! A new referee ran to the ring and Foley technically got the three count, but the referee decided not to count it for whatever dumb reason. Foley then got the sock and put it on his hand. He ran at Abyss, but Abyss tripped him face-first into the barbed wire board! Daffney climbed to the top ropes, but Abyss Chokeslammed her...THROUGH THE FREAKING BARBED WIRE BOARD HE SET UP EARLIER!!! Dr. Stevie started attacking Abyss, but Abyss hit a Black Hole Slam on him onto the thumbtacks!!! Abyss then Chokeslammed Foley onto the barbed wire board, and he dragged Stevie over and forced him to make the three count! Winner: Abyss. Match Rating: 5/5

Kurt Angle vs. Matt Morgan
Awesome, awesome match. It started with Angle fleeing from Morgan, but Morgan kept pursuing him. Morgan manhandled Angle in the ring, and then started focusing on his previously injured neck. Morgan did a reverse Chokeslam to Angle and made his face land on the top turnbuckle, and then continued with the violence. Angle fought back by focusing on Morgan's leg, and he applied a couple of unique submission holds and even chopblocked it. Matt fought back and went for a Chokeslam, but Angle countered into a roll-up! Morgan barely kicked out and then managed to hit Angle with the Chokeslam, but Angle kicked out! Morgan then hit his signature offense and went for the Hellevator, but Angle fought back and got Matt on the ground again. Focusing on the leg, Angle applied a Figure Four Leg Lock, but Morgan finally reversed it, forcing Angle to grab the ropes to break the hold. Morgan countered the Angle Slam, but Angle hit it with his second attempt after a series of German suplexes, and but Morgan kicked out! Angle then tried to apply the Ankle Lock, but Morgan pushed him away. Angle kept reapplying the hold, and Morgan tried to push him away again, but Angle jumped WITH Morgan's foot and kept the pressure on!!! Morgan managed to get Angle away finally, missed the Carbon Footprint, but then connected with the move when Angle charged him! This only earned another two count, but then Morgan hit the Hellevator...BUT ANGLE KICKED OUT!!! A visibly frustrated Morgan went to the top rope and hit a flying forearm smash, but Angle still kicked out. Morgan went for another Hellevator, but Angle rolled through and applied the Ankle Lock! Matt got to his feet and broke the hold, only to end up eating an Angle Slam! Angle didn't just leave it at that though. He went to the top ropes and hit a Frog Splash, ala Eddie Guerrero, but Morgan STILL KICKED OUT!!! Angle went to the top ropes again for a moonsault, but Matt got up and then went for a Tombstone Piledriver!!! Angle rolled through and applied another Ankle Lock, but Matt fought out yet AGAIN and hit the Discus Clothesline! ANGLE KICKED FREAKING OUT! Morgan went to the top ropes again, but Angle suddenly sprang to his feet and hit a super belly-to-belly suplex! Morgan STILL freaking kicked out and then went for a powerbomb, but Angle rolled him up. Morgan then went for another Hellevator, but Angle rolled him up for the final time and won the match!!! After the match, Angle shook Morgan's hand. Winner: Kurt Angle. Match Rating: 5/5

TNA World Heavyweight Championship Match: AJ Styles (Champion) vs. Sting
Great, great match. It started with a lot of psychology and submission holds, and Sting and AJ dodging each other's moves. Then Sting went on the sick offensive, throwing AJ hard into the corners and hitting some power moves. Sting clotheslined AJ to the outside, but then let him back into the ring. The fight spilled to the outside again after AJ hit a nice missile dropkick, but Sting moved out of the way before AJ could hit a Suicide Dive. AJ then went for a Suicide Dive off the ring apron, but Sting moved out of the way and AJ hit the security railing. Sting then went for a Stinger Splash on AJ while he was leaning against the security barricade, but AJ moved out of the way and Sting hit the barricade. AJ stopped Earl Hebner from counting Sting out, and he demanded Sting came back into the ring, thus returning the favor from earlier. AJ went for a Tombstone Piledriver, but Sting countered...INTO HIS OWN TOMBSTONE PILEDRIVER!!! AJ kicked, amazingly, and Sting then continued on the offensive. Sting went for a Scorpion Death Drop, but AJ countered into a Scorpion Death Drop attempt of his own. Sting countered again, and then AJ countered again, and then Sting countered again, finally hitting the move! Sting's injury from earlier by running into the barricade kept him from capitalizing on the move, and AJ got up first and rested in the corner. Sting then got up and while AJ was resting, with his face away from Sting, Sting hit a reverse Stinger Splash and then ANOTHER Scorpion Death Drop!!! AJ kicked out, but Sting wasn't derailed. He applied the Scorpion Deathlock next, but AJ managed to power out of the hold. AJ went to the top, but Sting followed. AJ headbutted Sting to the mat, but his legs were injured so he fell off the top ropes and onto the apron. Sting went to capitalized, but AJ came out of nowhere with a Pele Kick on the apron! AJ then hit a springboard splash on Sting to win the match and retain his title! Winner: AJ Styles. Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
This show was the best TNA show of the entire year. There was only one average match, and besides that, almost every single match was a perfect match, with the exception of one really good, but not amazing, match. The main event delivered, but we were left on the edge about if Sting will retire or not. Angle's possible face turn was interesting, and all the title changes added suspense to everything. There were amazing, never before seen things in many of the matches, and it felt like TNA has finally discovered the magic that goes into doing a WrestleMania-esque show. Bound for Glory though now stands away from WrestleMania. People will no longer say, ""Bound for Glory is TNA's WrestleMania."" No, they will just say, ""Bound for Glory is TNA's biggest show of the year."" This is how you do a wrestling show, and this is what about professional wrestling is all about. There was high-flying action, hardcore action, technical wrestling, women's wrestling, and even some of the crazy and silly shenanigans that goes along with any good wrestling show. This is TNA's pay-per-view of the year, no doubt."
1845,5.0,"This is a freaking great series.  I watched it on a Korean cable channel originally with my wife and we got seriously hooked.  It is not an accident that I have seen Korean dramas on airport TVs all over the world.  And this is the best of the best.  Trust me - you will be up all night, cause you can't watch just one episode.
There was one scene where the to-be queen as a kid is framed with Fort Jiayuguan in China, where the Great Wall begins in the west, in the background.  This impressed me so much I included this destination on my next trip to China and got a picture from the same spot.  The production values of this series are outstanding as is the acting."
1846,1.0,"One of the freaking stupedist movies I have ever seen.  The acting isn't bad, but the plot is total garbage.  A woman is pushed out of a car and told to meet back at the hotel and then walks through about 50 miles of desert at high noon????? Don't wast your time on this movie.  Wish I hadn't."
1847,5.0,"The great film with the silly title, Power Kids (original Thai title: 5 Heart Heroes, but also known as Force of Five) is a terrific, action-packed martial arts film produced by the director of Ong-bak and Chocolate - which, if you've seen either of these films means you know what a rollercoaster ride the action sequences in this will be. Kids are the heroes here, as the film opens with a little shrimp of a kid named Wun, who lives with his brother Wut at a Muy Thai school where they have grown close to a few other students, forming a close bond of friendship between all five. Adorable and precocious, all Wun wants to do is be a normal kid - but born with a severe heart condition, the little boy has always had to take things slow, always under the protective eye of his older brother.

When circumstances occur that make Wun even more ill, to the point where a transplant is the only solution or Wun will die, the local hospital seeks frantically around Bangkok for a compatible heart donor - finally locating one at another hospital nearby. But with only four hours to spare, the heart is held up at the hospital - literally - when a band of violent terrorists take over the hospital, taking hostages and threatening to kill any and every person who stands in their way until their demands are met. With Wun so close to death, young Wut and his three friends band together to sneak past the terrorists, retrieve the heart for Wun, and get it back to the hospital before it's too late.

Yeah, the film is pretty obvious in trying to tug at the heartstrings ... but it's also an entertaining, action-packed roller coaster ride that has, at its center, a story of bravery, dedication, and friendship. The kids, while decent actors, are freaking amazing martial artists; there are no ""little people"" stunt doubles here, and these kids can both give and take a hit with real conviction on-screen; you'll be rooting and cheering for Wut and his friends from the very beginning, fairly yelling at the screen for them to kick the total ass of the bad-guy terrorist leader (Johnny Nguyen, coolly evil here).

Sure, the film can be overly sentimental; the plot even a bit far-fetched. But Power Kids is one of those films you'll be completely, emotionally caught up in, that also happens to have a positive message about love and friendship (though definitely not for young children, due to the violence and fight/action sequences). A worthy addition to your DVD library, and also worth repeat viewings just for those way-freaking-cool fight sequences alone!"
1848,2.0,"The monster was good. The women in the movie were worse than pathetic, what with all the screaming, panicking, freaking out and refusing to listen to common sense.. Seriously. Ugh. Always nice to see Ed Quinn though."
1849,1.0,"I'm not prone to superlatives--check my other reviews  if you doubt it--but this is the worst move that I've ever seen, and I feel ripped off by other reviewers who have suggested that it even is watchable, much less a positive entertainment experience.

I watched an hour of it in standard time before I simply had had enough and started fast forwarding. Anybody who watches this thing start to finish without doing that deserves a freaking medal. The script must have been written by an 11th-grade emo girl. I never actually even figured out the storyline; I felt no more recognition for the characters, setting, plot or themes by the end that I had before I put this piece of crap into the DVD player.

Therefore it would be pretty pointless for me to summarize this movie; best I can tell it's got something to do with an emaciated goth girl and her (actually very upper-middle-class) house, and a party, and a lot of weird stuff, and that's about all that I can tell you. Oh, I also can tell you that there isn't nearly as much nudity in this as some would have you believe. In fact there are only two true nude scenes and even one of them is ruined with FX and dumb cropping.

That's a natural lead-in for the criticism of this movie's production values. The audio is as bad  as anything I've ever experienced in a newly-produced film. The whole thing had to have been shot with one on-board microphone; part of the reason why I never could figure out what was going on is because I couldn't HEAR THE LINES. And the director must  have gotten a Johnny Editor Do-It-Yourself Home Kit for Christmas that year or something--there was so many nonsense technical effects like  running scenes in reverse, or in slow-motion, or making the characters simply instantly not be there in one scene then reappear later in another part of the frame. Even had the audio been of significant volume, it was so muddled up with garbage like reverb and other stupid effects that I  doubt that anybody could interpret it correctly anyway; to top it off, the score blasts you away with death metal. What a wonderful experience.

I'm not sure what else I need to say to keep you away from this one. I'll never be fooled by this production company again."
1850,5.0,"It's Tuesday night over here, and I was in the mood to watch some good old school horror, so I watched Stevan Mena's Bereavement, which is the prequel to Mena's Malevolence (2003). It's a really good psychological horror/slasher film and it's something like The Shining meets Friday The 13th, starring Brett Rickaby, Alexandra Daddario, and Spencer List as Martin Bristol. It also stars legendary actors Michael Biehn and John Savage. For those who have not heard about this film series, I highly recommend that you to start off with this prequel, Bereavement, and witness the rise of pure evil before you watch its 2003 slasher follow-up, Malevolence. Also, this film is not for the faint of heart; it's eerie, it's disturbing and it's freaking intense. It's 2018 now, eight years since 2010's Bereavement and hopefully, one day in the near future, we fans will get a third chapter from mastermind and horror filmmaker Stevan Mena."
1851,3.0,"his is the seventh ""Cross The Line"" set from TNA but continuing to follow the pattern of the previous sets in that this is a double pack of two PPV's. These events happened after the Lockdown PPV with the biggest changes coming in TNA repacking themselves under the name of ""Impact Wrestling: Where Wrestling Matters.""

Sacrifice '11
Ink Inc. vs. Mexican America - Ink Inc. had issues with some of the anti-American statements made by Mexican America in the past few weeks leading to this match there. The main story continuing to be the issues between Moore & Neal as Rosita & Serena kept distracting the referee throughout the match to give M.A. an advantage but when they got involved one time too many, they argued over how to handle the situation. This was a solid encounter that had non-stop action but look out for the finish as Jesse Neal lands directly on his face.

Brian Kendrick vs. Robbie E - Kendrick gave a ""Ultimate Warrior"" style promo before the match & kept freaking out Robbie in the beginning with him showcasing his ""yoga/zen"" attitude down to wrestling in his robe to the point where Robbie kept calling him a ""freak"" & Cookie was freaked out when Kendrick preached how ""God Has A Plan For You!"" Robbie tried to use Kendrick's robe to choke him & even caused his mouth to bleed in what turned out to be another solid contest but the ending was just comedic as the beginning with Kendrick trying to show sportsmanship only for Robbie to be so confused saying ""What Is Wrong With You Bro!?! Your A Freak!""

Knockouts Champion Mickie James vs. Madison Rayne - This was the final encounter against each other with the special stipulation that Tara would be free of her contractual obligations to Madison if Mickie won the match & knowing that, Tara came to ringside despite being told by Madison to stay backstage. This was a nice match between the two but this was all about ""What Is Tara Going To Do"" as Madison kept ordering Tara to help her only for her to be conflicted as she held back from hitting Mickie, taking the knockout glove away from Madison, and Tara being the deciding factor in the victory.

X Division Champion Kazarain vs. Max Buck - They started out trying to ground each other before starting to pick up the pace with both men starting to pull out all the stops. Max performed such moves as a running powerbomb into the corner & a twisting diamond cutter from the top rope & 450 splash while Kaz pulled off such moves as a springboard twisting legdrop & a leaping sunset flip onto the floor that resulted in Max's head hitting the concrete floor. This got the crowd really hot & screaming ""This Is Wrestling"" which was the truth, this was a excellent wrestling match.

Crimson vs. Abyss - Before the match, Abyss gave one of the best promos I've ever seen from him. This was your average ""big man"" match that was very slow & really nothing of note as Abyss is limited in non-hardcore matches while Crimson is still ""green"" but able to showcase his strength with moves like a strong spear & D'Lo Brown's old ""Sky High"" powerbomb.

Tag Team Champions Beer Money vs. Matt Hardy & Chris Harris - For those TNA fans who weren't around back then, Chris Harris is James Storm's old tag team partner in America's Most Wanted who were the dominate team in TNA during the first four & half years of the company which Harris showcased on the way to the ring as he came out with the old AMW ring gear & theme song. Knowing the history between these two, Harris kept avoiding Storm whenever possible only to come in whenever he had an advantage with even Taz mentioning how Harris is out of shape & the strategy of the team being for Hardy to be the workhorse of the team which included working over Roode's back with various bearhugs & elbow drops. Storm eventually got his hands on Harris & beat him down including executing the hanging DDT before finishing him off with a move that was the trademark of AMW. This was a nice match as Beer Money were good as they naturally were while Hardy carried his team as Harris was very limited here.

No Disqualification Match: A.J. Styles vs. Tommy Dreamer - Tommy was conflicted for weeks in regards to what he had to do for his career leading into this match with A.J. & it was shown in the early moments that Dreamer was heavily conflicted as he went to the ropes telling the referee to have A.J. break the hold only for the referee to remind him that it's a ""No DQ"" match so A.J. didn't have to break causing Styles to yell at Dreamer ""You Made This Match Famous Now Wrestle!"" Dreamer eventually got on his game with moves like a boot in the corner that dropped A.J. hard while hitting A.J.'s head on the ringside steps. Styles retaliated by dumping soda on Dreamer's head before executing a springboard clothesline from the guardrail when Dreamer was crotched on it. The fight ended up in the crowd with both men turning up the intensity such as Styles chopping Dreamer over a wall before he rammed A.J. into another wall. Weapons came into play once they got back in the ring such as trash cans & tables (which was used in a creative way by Styles) before a weapon was reintroduced to A.J. by Dreamer that played an important factor in their last PPV encounter. Bully Ray made an appearance along with Daniels but it was a very impactful piledriver that made the difference here. Tommy Dreamer is known as the ""Innovator Of Violence"" for a reason as he's at his best when it comes to these brawling types of matches which A.J. showed that he's no stranger to it either as this was a great brutal brawl from start to finish.

Kurt Angle & Chyna vs. Jeff & Karen Jarrett - Due to Karen's constant involvement in Kurt's matches against Jeff, Kurt hired a woman to take care of Karen for him in what was revealed to be Jarrett's old nemesis in Chyna. This was under mixed-tag rules meaning only the same sex can wrestle each other. This was a different match than the previous ones we've seen from both men as this revolved around Chyna getting her hands on Karen with the in-ring action coming secondary. Kurt & Jeff mixed it up for a bit before Kurt tagged in Chyna before revealing a loophole in the rules that allowed Karen to remain safe by Chyna only for Kurt to later try to carry Karen to Chyna before being cut off again before Chyna did eventually get her hands on Karen. Kurt & Jeff did alright in the ring but this was a match that was setup to revolve around the women & that's exactly what it did but I'll give it credit in that it was still entertaining.

TNA Champion Sting vs. Rob Van Dam - Mr. Anderson won the battle royal on the previous Impact to receive the title shot at Slammiversary so he came out & did commentary on this match. Both men started off slow in the ring but started to pick up the pace when they went to the floor after Sting ducked RVD's attempted running leg lariat in the corner that went him over the top the floor. Both men attempted moves on using the railing only to miss before taking the match into the crowd. Sting & RVD took some punishment as both men went into the wall at one point while RVD also delivered a standing forward dropkick to Sting that had him land hard on the floor himself. As both men were very exhausted & beat up by the time they got back to the ring, they still were able to counter & block each other's signature moves to the point where it took two back to back Scorpion Deathdrops to make sure RVD stayed down for Sting to retain his championship. This was a very solid main event as it really picked up with the brawl in the crowd & didn't stop from there.

Slammiversary IX
TNA Tag Team Champions James Storm & Alex Shelley vs. British Invasion - With Bobby Roode having a shoulder injury, Shelley stepped up to defend his championship for him in this match while Roode did commentary. Storm & Shelley showed very good chemistry with each other as a team doing some good double team moves including one comedic eye poke (just watch to see how they set that up). The Brits decided to single out Shelley & work over him for a bit building up to making the hot tag to Storm. Their was a moment of miscommunication between Storm & Shelley but all four men worked together to deliver a solid opening match that had good action from bell to bell.

Matt Morgan vs. Scott Steiner - ""The D.N.A. Of TNA"" vs. ""The Generic Freak"" had Morgan in control early on to the point where Steiner had to cheat in order to get an advantage before he worked over Morgan on the ground to take away his height advantage. Both men relied on power moves such as various slams & suplexes with both men pulling out moves that were unexpected such as how Morgan was able to power out of the Steiner Recliner only for Steiner to counter that into a victory roll. I'll give both guys credit in that both worked a style to put this over as a grudge match but it wasn't anything more than a nice watchable match.

X Division Champion Abyss vs. Brian Kendrick vs. Kazarian - With Abyss making it clear that he was out to destroy the X division, Brian Kendrick came out more focused than we've ever seen him in TNA as he wasn't in his robe wardrobe nor had his peaceful ""zen"" attitude. Kaz & Kendrick tried to take Abyss on individually only for both men to fail causing both men to work together causing both men to get some offense in such as Kendrick pulling off a tornado DDT while Kaz almost got a win with a victory roll. Abyss stuck to the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" as he would take one guy out of the ring & work over the other in the ring such as Kaz's back with his plan working as eventually Kaz & Kendrick did turn on each other leading to Abyss being able to pick up the pieces. This match told a good story between all three men & did it's job in having Abyss come off as a dominate monster for the first time in a long time.

Crimson vs. Samoa Joe - The man with a current month long winning steak in TNA against the man who has the most memorable winning streak in TNA history with this PPV making the 6 year anniversary of Joe's debut in TNA that started that streak. Joe targeted Crimson's leg with various moves such as the dragon screw legwhip, a knee buster, legbars & kicks, and even Terry Funk's spinning toe hold. Crimson was able to showcase some offense of his own such as getting an armbar with his legs & tossing Joe with a t-bone suplex before Joe retailed with a suplex of his own & again going to the legs with a single leg crab with Crimson coming back with his skyhigh powerbomb. Joe was on his game here as he was in control for a majority of the match & carried Crimson to the best match of his career so far along with us seeing signs of the old ""Samoan Submission Machine"" that we haven't seen in recent memory.

Knockouts Champion Mickie James vs. Angelina Love - I'll be blunt here in that these girls had an off night (including the botched finish) as nothing was really special here past putting over the story of Winter constantly being a distraction for Mickie by getting involved many times throughout the match.

Last Man Standing Match: A.J. Styles vs. Bully Ray - Both men started off exchanging fist before the fight was taken to the outside where weapons got involved as Ray dropped Styles across the steps that were setup on it's side. Back in the ring, Ray kept chopping Styles chest with A.J. getting up each time & daring Ray to hit him again leaving visible welts on his chest each time. Both men kept fighting to the point where Ray took out his infamous chain only for Styles to use it & bust Ray open followed by a springboard 450 splash into the ring & fight back outside the ring to the stage area. A.J. delivered one hell of a visual with his running flying forearm smash off the stage onto Ray who was on the floor at the time & then climbed up the stage truss to drop an elbow off the top of that onto Ray who was laid out on a table before Styles took one hell of an impactful hit into the stage wall. This was without a doubt the match of the night as it was physically brutal with telling the story of A.J. Styles being a fighting man by taking Ray's best shot & demanding more while dishing out just as much punishment himself.

TNA Champion Sting vs. Mr. Anderson - After Anderson's constant showing of disrespect towards Sting for weeks & losing his match on Impact earlier in the week, Sting completely snapped & even wore a new variation of his face paint which continued here as he jumped Anderson early & beat him up towards the ring. They went into the crowd brawling & throwing each other into walls to the point where a cameraman tripped & fell when they were fighting back to the ring. Anderson tried to work over Sting's wrist by slamming it into the steps & wrapping it around the ringpost before using moves such as a hammerlock & various armbars. Sting was able to fight back & had Anderson beat before Eric Bischoff made his presence known & screwed Sting in a way that looked good on paper but just didn't come off well when executed. This was a good match putting over the various stories coming in (Sting's snapping while Bischoff trying to take away the power Sting has a TNA Champion while also screwing ""The Network"" in the process) with the only real bad thing being how the ending came off.

Kurt Angle vs. Jeff Jarrett - This was setup to be their final battle with the bonus stipulations of this being to determine the #1 contender for the TNA Championship with Angle's Olympic Gold Medals while Karen Angle wasn't at ringside allowing Kurt to finally get his one on one match. Both men started off early with some wrestling before Kurt got tossed over the top rope & landed on his shoulder which Jeff took advantage off by throwing him into steps shoulder first. Both men went back & forth as they knew each other so well that they were able to keep reversing & countering each other's holds such as Jarrett constantly escaping the anklelock while Kurt turned Jarrett over from a powerbomb into that hold. Jeff got desperate & used his trademark guitar (and removed the evidence for the first time ever that I can recall) to no avail before he applied his own anklelock before it was reversed for the final tapout. This was very good as both men worked a different match than their previous ones in that this was a straight up wrestling match that had both men having some well performed back & forth sequences that stands strong on it's own but didn't top their previous performances.

Sacrifice was a very solid show from top to bottom as it did it's job in giving you matches that were entertaining for what it was (mixed tag & Kendrick/Robbie) & filled with good wrestling. Slammiversary started off slow with some people having a bad night (Knockouts) & the first half of the PPV having matches that were nice & average but didn't really get out of first gear before picking up the pace with the second half of the PPV. In the end, both events had their share of good entertaining wrestling & it's two shows for the price of one so this is something worth a viewing."
1852,5.0,freaking love this show.  dry humor.
1853,1.0,"Absolutely one of the worst, dumbest, stupidest, nonsensical films ever made in the entire galaxy (Milky Way). Full of annoying characters, nonsensical scenes, totally meaningless and absurd ""plot,"" and an COMPLETE waste of time. With 31 minutes left, I could not take it anymore and dumped it.

See it if you want. If you were born after 1965 you will totally freaking LOVE it !
.

."
1854,4.0,"I haven't had this for long, but these are my first impressions.

First of all I've been a Tracy Anderson fan for the past 2 years or so. I actually got this as part of the 2-DVD pack (a steal!). So I thought I could handle this. But let me tell, you this lady kicks your butt in the gentlest way possible.

After a few days I can only get 3/4 through the Arms section, and I can only make it 3/4 of the way on each leg for Part 1 of the Butt section. I'm not even going to try Part 2 for now. These exercises leave me shaky and exhausted (and I can't even do them all!), but I feel like if you're a trooper you'll get fast results.

The Arms are sort of a more refined version of Tracy Anderson's arm exercises, and they freaking KILL! As for the Butt exercises, I am not going to lie--I have been cursing at the poor women while she smiles.

I left one star off because I feel like there's a lot of strain on my arms and wrists for some of these exercises, and I have to modify with some other exercises so as not to re-injure old injuries."
1855,1.0,"Oh no, another found footage movie!  Ay caramba!  It's about 6 reality show contestants who have to spend the night in a haunted asylum.  They act like typical ghost investigators with their EMF meter technology.  These ""contestants"" are just typical loud-mouthed teens who freak out at the slightest sights and sounds such as bats flying in a dark basement and a bucket suddenly appearing in the middle of a hallway without explanation.  They also freak out when their flashlights stop working.  I like the spaghetti sauce cabinet though.  That stuff's scary good!

The movie loses me early on when the teens go to sleep and one girl sits up meditating, and soon after when the one guy with a camera spies on a fellow contestant female taking a shower.  Really bland.  As is typical of found footage films, these characters have no personality whatsoever.  While being interviewed some of them don't believe in ghosts, others admit they freak out over the slightest sound, and others just aren't interested in spending 7 nights here.  And yet, here they are with their lack of personality ruining the movie.

7 Nights of Darkness has a couple interesting moments at least.  The segment where they stumble upon a doll standing up behind a door is pretty good with unexplainable scratches on the nearby wall.  The seance 25 minutes in has no scariness whatsoever because the one girl is *way* too talkative and bratty to be a contestant.  This same girl appears to be faking the silent treatment after the seance is over as a way to make the others feel sorry for her since she claims to care deeply about the ghosts of this house whereas none of the other contestants give a crap, but she's not faking it.  She's ice cold and just sitting there on the floor.  The other contestants take her to her room.

One of the teens complains when he has to spend time in the same room with the girl.  It should be noted when the story shifts to the next day or night, it does so in the lamest way ever with no atmosphere to speak of.  When the ""investigators"" hear a baby crying, an investigator in another room sneaks around the corner of the hallway and says ""Hey guys!"" freaking the rest of group out, proving that *all* of them are really timid!

They stumble upon a pizza box with worms all over it, and the one girl freaks out big time over this.  They find a note that says lobotomies were often performed here.  A long sharp instrument was inserted under the eyelid of the patient with a hammer through their skull and brain.  The other girl of the group is encouraged to be locked into the chair.  The ice cold silent treatment girl wakes up just in time for the contestants to find something unusual in one of the pictures they took... and she RUNS down the hallway towards the group and attacks them resulting in a LOT of screaming.

The contestants get into an argument when the one guy doesn't want to be in the same room as the woman who just ran down the hallway and attacked the group.  Yeah, I wouldn't want to be alone with her either.  I can understand his complaint.  This storyline is a total mess up to this point.  Being alone with the girl, he tries to talk to her but she doesn't move a muscle.  He questions who she is- perhaps a local actress.  But she still won't move.  He thinks she's faking it.  He mentions how he'd like to take her clothes off and that he bets she'd like that.  He knows plenty of websites who'd pay good money for a pretty girl like her tied up in a chair showing everything she has.  She opens her eyes and gives the guy a mean look.  He wants to know who hired her, what her game is and what her reason is for being here.  He mentions something I was wondering- how can she be so talkative before the seance then become so silent!  WHOA!  An actual scary scene!  She takes exception to being criticized for her talkative ways.  Her face turns green and she lunges towards the guy.

In the next scene, the other girl of the group gets a major surprise- she walks into a room with a camera and nobody's there.  Suddenly she turns back around and three guys are playing cards at a table.  A moment ago nobody was sitting there, AHHHHH!!  Actually that is kind of scary.  They all start fighting again when the girl says nobody was sitting at the table a moment ago.

One of the guys says he was sent here by one of the producers which upsets the rest of the group.  He says he's here to make sure everyone leaves, and to do everything in his power to make sure that happens.  The maggots in the food, the baby crying... it was all him.  But the one thing that is NOT set up is the silent girl upstairs with the green lunging face.  That wasn't in the script!  They get into another argument when unexplainable images appear on the cell phone.  They all accuse the guy sent here by the producers of staging it.  They decide to check on the silent treatment girl and determine they're all going to split up the money when the 7th night is over.

Of course when they get there the girl is gone.  Her green face must've angered a demon, forcing the demon to let the girl roam free.  The guy tries to explain the girl's green face but nobody listens because he's the same guy who was sent here by the producers, so nobody believes him.  The group talks sensibly for a while which is hard to believe.

The one guy takes a pee, turns the faucet on and hears lots of wall pounding behind him from the bathroom stall.  He freaks out like a baby.  Wow just open the door already!  Don't be scared!  It takes a couple minutes for him to get the courage to open that door.  When he does nothing's there... at first.  When he opens the door again now a girl's there.  The camera goes out.

The group finds a note that says a little girl is known to roam these hallways so the group does another seance to try and summon her.  They ask if she's lonely here.  No reply means she's too lonely to speak... I suppose. A little girl skips past the doorway.  Suddenly they all see her.  For some reason a second or two later everyone relaxes and talks about what they saw in the camera which is lame.  Talk about the scary girl you just saw!

The one guy being interviewed says it's not fun being the guy who's always scared and picked on.  He's right, that's not fun at all.  He implies he wants to be a leader for the rest of the group.  While the group is sleeping the green-faced girl who escaped from the chair earlier appears in front of them giggling and touching them.  She lacks confidence all of a sudden.  She was the most talkative person of the group early on- now she can only communicate with the group while they're asleep.

When they all wake up one of the guys is gone.  He says he went to the bathroom when questioned.  ""I have to wake you up when I drop a turd?""  haha.  The groups tries to tell themselves it'll be safe since they only have 2 nights left.  I just want those 2 nights to hurry up already!  This movie's horrible!  The guy won't leave the bathroom.  He's too scared.  They say he has to leave or the producers won't give him any money, but he says he'll go to a jury if he has to.  Yes that'll work.

From here the contestants quietly discuss that they're going to wait it out and just stand around panicking.  They're panicking but the viewers aren't.  The little girl doll standing up turns into a regular little girl who walks forward strangely.  The guy in the same room tries to leave but someone drags him from behind.  This movie has a way of returning to normal conversational talk among the contestants after a scare happens.  It's probably the lamest thing about 7 Nights of Darkness.  A good horror keeps the horror flowing and won't drop the scares suddenly giving the feeling these contestants have short term memory loss.

Maybe the contestants forget what just happened a moment earlier, but I think they just like to hear themselves speak.  More door banging when a man and female contestant are in the room together.  One guy says something just touched him.  The camera gets jerky when a woman in a black dress runs down the hallway towards the two contestants.  When they slam the door the noise stops and she goes away.  When they look through the door hole... wasted opportunity here.  Nothing happens.  That would have been a GREAT moment for something scary too.

The girl contestant refuses to stick around and screams when a demon girl crawls awkwardly up the stairs.  Okay I admit this part is very scary!  The guy tries to leave the asylum but the door won't open.  Bad door!  Meanwhile a demon swarms around the room.  The movie ends.  Horrible, just horrible."
1856,2.0,"As an aside to the whole venture, anyone who has ever seriously considered ""where are they"" has to have considered Fermi's Paradox several times over. So the physicist ""expert"" shoots himself in the foot with his very introduction and how ""very likely"" it is we'll ever see an alien race. Ever. As to the film:

I'm going to give this an extra star because it did hold my attention for most of the mockumentary. My problem is that it tried so hard to take itself seriously. There are so many contradictions to the premise for the invasion as it moves forward and our attacks become (spoilers) more successful culminating in a balloon assault on a ship that had shielding that would block a nuke from penetrating it. That's, of course, operating under the very large assumption that any non-interstellar craft would have or be capable of generating the same defenses that the larger interstellar craft would need for such travel.

My real problem is with ""Why they came"". They're here to harvest plant and animal life? First for food, which--come on--who wants to eat a pinecone? Then as we ""discover"" they're robot drones and we decide they're using plants and animals for biofuels--fuel being conveniently left out of the reasons why they wouldn't attack earth as they would not attack for other resources like water and minerals because there are easier ways to get them than attacking a populated planet. We're launching nukes and they're blowing up our power plants in the first hours of invasion but they came here for chlorophyll as an energy source?  An energy source reliant on the freaking sun (as in the plants use sunlight for food and protein EATS said plants for food/fuel)? They can have the solar panels off my house and cut out the middle man. War averted. Just--good luck using any solar reliant system in the very dark interstellar reaches between planets or getting it to provide enough power for a Faster Than Light drive. A potato might run a light bulb but its not efficient enough to power my refrigerator, forget FTL.

So the question remains unanswered as to why an alien race would attack a planet populated by crazy two-legged psychopaths who will--WILL--nuke not just one but every city twice over whether it works or not on their ships but in the weak hope that it would irradiate the area and make these little green guys decide we're too crazy to eat. There are only two reasons why any race would ever visit this planet with violent intent: to make sure our crazy species never leaves it or to live on it themselves. If its the former, there wouldn't be any brave defense and resistance fighting over years and generations. They'd just glass the planet and be done ah la Halo Reach. If its the later then the historical research they should be doing shouldn't be into insurgent tactics but into what European colonists did to Native Americans.

If I can figure this out, why can't these experts?"
1857,1.0,"Solid acting but my lord is the pace slow in this film. Nothing happens for the first 45 minutes or so and by that time, I just couldn't wait to be done with the freaking thing. The cast tries but the story just isn't there."
1858,1.0,"I know... just because a movie gets a bad review doesn't mean that *you* aren't going to like. I think the same way. Let me just stop you right there. I'm going to tell you just how bad this movie really is - I have NEVER written a review on a movie before. An exception had to be made for this... ""movie.""

This is by far, THE stupidest waste of film I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through - and I am a fan of low-budget B-movies. The ""stars"" couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag if a gun was held to their head. Not that that would matter in this movie [SPOILER ALERT] because the one time that the good guys actually do have a gun, all of the idiots use it - not as a gun - but as a freaking HAMMER. Not one character has the intelligence to pull the freaking trigger - they just hit the bad guy with it!

By the end of the movie, I was hoping that the bad guy would come out of the screen and put ME out of my misery! If you are looking to kill a few brain cells, you've got three options - drink a beer; get stoned; or watch this garbage..."
1859,3.0,"The opening credits part of the film makes you expect that this is a great movie. Some clips on the early part of the film is a waste and pretty much does not have any significance to it other than a filler. The reason of the 3 star rating is due to the middle of the film where you will really get some chills. SPOILER ALERT!!! While they were looking for  a way out, it was freaking morning and bright, they did not even notice that the air conditioner in the window can be removed or dismantled. Only if they did not show that air conditioner unit then it would have made more sense.

You'll pretty much enjoy the film until the end. The ending is jaw dropping. You'll forget that you have been watching a ""horror"" themed movie. The ending to me was like ""Say what?!?!?"". It was good until it became government experiment conspiracy kind of thing.

An OK movie if you don't have anything to watch like I did. Amazon does not have a 2.5 stars so I chose 3 stars. My rating for this movie is really between ""I DON'T LIKE IT"" AND ""IT'S OK"".

The Good: No background music much and even without that bgm in the background, it delivered a chill at some point.

The Bad: The ending! The jaw dropping transition from a soft porn to horror theme and to a government experiment kind of thing."
1860,5.0,So freaking funny and different from anything else.
1861,5.0,"I went into the viewing of this movie with preconceived notions thinking it was going to be the typical Steve Carell comedy. Instead what I got was heartfelt, somewhat sad, comedic love story. Steve Carell and Kiera Knightly were absolutely perfect in these roles. My suggestion is to either watch the trailer and then watch the movie or go into it having an open mind without watching the trailer. No spoilers below, just opinions.

The reality is 95% of the movie coasts along with some pretty funny moments and some moments that may even have you reflecting on your own personal life.
Then the last 10 minutes of the movie hits and I believe that's where I came to absolutely love it and was even actually blown away.

After the movie was over we were still discussing it an hour later because it had us thinking so much. Steve Carell and Kiera Knightly were so freaking good and were so believable in their roles. In closing, this movie has a little bit of everything and that's why I gave it 5 stars! Loved it!"
1862,4.0,"Our son happens to really like Barney, so we bought this one a while back to help start a dialogue with him about his medical visits.  Since he is a child with pretty specialized needs, he has a great many of those that have happened, and will continue to happen.

He likes this video, especially the songs.  He would rate this a 5.  I would rate this a 3, because I think it, like many such products on the market, definitely has a target audience that is a normal functioning and developing child.  This movie does a great job of highlighting the positives about these situations, which of course, you want a child to know, but it is the negatives that a special needs child is going to react strongest to, and will need by far the most preparation for.

In general, I would have to say that writers for movies and children's books don't exactly understand the special circle in hell that is reserved for a parent of a child with special needs trying to prepare them for doctor's offices, dentists, or surgical procedures.  First, you often get to wait months longer then a normal developing child for things like dental procedures because they need to be done in the hospital.  Then you have things like blood pressure cuffs, pulse ox monitors, IVs, good golly it's a never ending list of things you have to try and prepare and desensitize them for.  And then you have a joyful moment where your procedure gets moved up, which is great because you don't have to watch your kiddo suffer with mouth pain for an extra 3 months, only to have to then prepare him/her for what it will be like with much less time.

 And try explaining why you can't eat or drink for half a day to a child with the nature of challenges my child has.  He's going to be hysterical to the point I may end up holding him for a few hours to keep him from harming himself.  Because if restraint is required, I do it myself so he never doubts that love is involved in protecting him from harm.  My son's last ER visit, it took 5 people to hold him down to get done what was needed.  And that was without skipping food for half the day.  So all of those sensory things and people anxieties are going to be amplified like most people can't even imagine.

I could go on.  So for us and our family, this is a starting place to talk, and he loves Barney, but it doesn't address or help him understand the things that are going to be freaking him out the most.  And because he prefers to look at something visually interesting rather then listen to mama talk on and on about what's going to be happening, it would definitely be an advantage to have a product that addresses the things that are going to matter to him most."
1863,2.0,"I don't quite know what to say about this film.

I don't read other reviews and have no desire to dissect the film. I review these things to let you know whether you might like the film m,or not, not to be erudite.

Maybe a Korean audience would know what this was about, but I have no freaking idea. It didn't know what it wanted to be: adventure, man against the odds, ghost film or what. It was surreal and over the top as six men try to march to some fictitious point called the P.O.I. I mean---they could have just choppered there, so it's a phony expedition to begin with. And when they start dying one by one, I mean, like, it's time to use the sat-link to call in the rescue party, like Bear and Les' do on TV.

But the ""captain"" keeps driving his men onward into death, and they follow, against all reason and intelligence. Maybe this fictitious point at the Antarctic requires some special ""bushido"" from men, not just flying down to it, I don't know. But something special is supposed to happen when they get there.

I did not get the plot; I did not get the ending; I was not interested or entertained. I feel I wasted my time and could have been watching a good Bollywood comedy or a Jap/Chinese period piece.

Korean film is not good at this sort of story. It was more Jap/Chinese. Koreans are great at comedy, period pieces, and mobster stuff, but this was just too philosophical and obscure for me to enjoy or be innerested in---I mean, I don't want to work THAT hard to get the point.

Also, the cgi (men plodding across trackless wasteland) and green screen (dark skies, caverns, etc.) stuff didn't work for me and was just irritating.

Give it a miss, is what I advise :)

Sorry.

1864,3.0,"This was the first official pay-per-view for the UFC of 2013.  Given the rocky year that the UFC went through in 2012 they set up a big pay-per-view to start off the year with.  Interestingly, given the biggest fight of the night was a title shot but two of the other big fights also had title implications.  So, a very important night in planning the months' coming events.

Joseph Benavidez and Ian McCall are both fresh off the tournament to crown the first Flyweight Champion in UFC history.  If you've been following, you should know that Demetrious Johnson won that tournament and then successfully defended said title last month.  So, both fighters were looking to use a victory in order to get a title shot at a man they had both fought in the past year.  Both fighters are wrestlers with decent striking but the main difference lies in Benavidez's power, a factor which most people thought would have played a part in his title losing effort against Johnson.  Now, given the 125 weight class most fights at this level tend to go to decision and are more about points than finishes.  But don't confuse that with a lack of excitement as the fighters at this weight division move so much fast than you're probably accustomed to.  As originally guessed this fight goes to the judges decision but I for one was pleasantly surprised at how strong both fighters looked in this fight.  Although each fighter's performance may not be awe inspiring I think it should be noted that these guys cancelled each other out as opposed to a straight boring fight.

Next up was a fight with a lot of interesting points going on.  Jon Fitch has a been a perennial top contender ever since he first challenged GSP for the Welterweight title back in 2008.  He's one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world and known for grinding out decisions with scary efficiency.  Now, this doesn't always make for the most exciting fight but there's not denying Fitch's talent as he has done this to top talent for years.  His opponent, Demian Maia, on the other hand is known more for being a Jiu-Jitsu fighter, with an evolving standup game.  As a multiple time world champion he is known for being absolutely devastating on the ground and it goes to show if you watch his early fights in the UFC where he's submitting people left and right.  Since then he's dropped a weight class and has since been undefeated.  Coming into this match it was revealed that Fitch held the best submission defense in UFC history, successfully guarding or escaping every submission he has ever been put in.  So, as a fan of good ground fights I kinda wanted to see how Fitch would handle someone on the level of Maia.  The fight I got was something of a double-edged sword.  There was a crap ton of technical prowess on display but as many fans will note it made for one heck of a grinding match.  Both fighters were going at a heavy pace and it may be hard to see if you don't know what's going on but it was a heck of a ground fight, if only predominantly one-sided.  The winner certainly makes a heck of an impression.

This is the second fight of the night with some interesting title implications.  Rashed Evans hasn't fought since he was defeated in his title losing effort against Jon Jones last April.  He has had a lot of time to decide where his career will go from there since and he's gone on to say that he wants a rematch against Jones.  Strangely enough, UFC management has some other idea of Evans.  Following the fallout of the Bisping/Belfort fight (If you don't know what happens, look it up and watch) Anderson Silva has been left without a clear contender for his title (Chris Weidman has been injured, and it sucks he can't fight sooner) so it was dependent on his performance on this night that he may get a title shot at ""The Spider"".  Unfortunately for Evans, Antnio Rogrio Nogueira stand in his way.  ""Lil' Nog"" was the national boxing champion of Brazil at one point and he's a Nogueira, so his Jiu-Jitsu is on a stupidly high level, so he was a legitimate threat on not only thwarting Evans's plans for a title shot but in getting a victory at all.  Given the importance of this fight I expected a much faster pace and I got what felt largely like a sparring match. There's just a lack of activity and what this boils down to is just straight out points, and not in the fun way where everything is lost in a maze of strikes and transitions.  Not a real fun match to watch, just simple as that.

In the co-main event, Alistair Overeem makes his return to the Octogan since defeating Brock Lesnar in his debut two Decembers ago.  Now, he was guaranteed a title shot after that victory until he tested positive for banned substances.  Most hardcore fans already know this since plans had to be changed up real fast with the results having been released little over a month before the actual pay-per-view. So he was unable to renew his license for over a full year and couldn't legally fight in that time.  In that time the Heavyweight division has changed quite a bit, which is a backwards step for thought but you should know what I mean, so Overeem has to earn his title shot again.  Interestingly enough, the man to last fight against current champion Cain Velasquez, before his title winning fight, was Antonio ""Big Foot"" Silva.  Given how well that fight went it's hard for people to understand just how dangerous he is since Velasquez made the fight largely a one-sided blood bath.  Look at his Strikeforce resume and look at the people he has beat or fought against and you'll come to understand real quick he's a legitimate threat in the UFC.  So, when Overeem started the talk of being flat out ""better"" I felt like Silva had a lot on his side in terms of motivation to go out and shut up the ""The Reem"".  Now, the fight plays out kind of how a typical heavyweight fight goes: not the fastest pace but plenty of leather thrown. Beyond that though there is a clear winner for a majority of the fight.  Then, something miraculous happened, a turn around.  I was jumping, rolling around, and just plain freaking out.  To put it simply, I love comebacks and this was a great one.  Trust me, this is the one fight of the night you will want to check out.

Here's the main selling point of the main card, the superfight between Jose Aldo and Frankie Edgar.  How often do we as fans talk about superfights between the pound-for-pound entrees?  Well, frankly too much with as little reward as I can imagine as a fan of the UFC.  It's so easy to talk about these things, hypothesize and strategize but it just doesn't happen, almost ever.  That's why when the announcement came that Aldo and Edgar were going to fight it seemed too good to be true.  This fight was originally supposed to happen this past October but Aldo was injured so it was postponed.  Before that his last title defense was January last year where he knocked out Chad Mendez in devastating fashion.  Edgar's 2012 was not as lucky.  He lost his title after three successful defenses to Benson Henderson and then was unsuccessful in getting it back (Or was he...?).  So, left in limbo Edgar was asked again, ""Are you going to drop down in weight?"" and he responded with a confirmation when he stepped in for Erik Koch who was injured in training.  So, here it was, the superfight between the current Featherweight champion and the former Lightweight champion.  That alone is a selling point.  To me, this fight felt a lot like Edgar's last fight with Henderson.  It's close.  I feel like it's closer than many people expected but with Edgar, you just can't count him out and that makes for a title fight full of close rounds and points to be judged with a fine comb.  If you're like me it's a hard fight to watch because while the speed is there for the lower weight classes the pace just feels a bit off but that's a personal preference for me.  Again, if you want to watch it be prepared for a fight that's not exactly a barn burner that's gonna knock your socks off but more of a technical fight for points.  Just didn't seem to bill the hype for me personally.

Now, the miraculous comment I made in regards to the Overeem/Silva fight is made simply because I hard time getting into most of this pay-per-view.  The comeback is the highlight to an otherwise underwhelming UFC card.  I wasn't blown away on a significant level by most of the fights and found most of the card, both main and under, was just alright.  For that reason I can't recommend buying this DVD."
1865,5.0,Babel is the only reason this gets 5 stars. Babel is a freaking masterpiece. Maybe not for everyone but a masterpiece. This gave me a chance to rewatch Se7en and it's kinda outdated. Troy is a waste of time.
1866,1.0,"Let's talk about what is going on in Darkest Night because it's honestly confusing.

A husband and wife visit a family in the Philippines.  The daughter of this family has a bad mouth and says the B word.  A bird eerily drops from the sky.  The husband introduces himself to the family and says he's into computer work.  Later the family and husband/wife have dinner and an earthquake/power outage occurs.  Nobody's freaked out.  A man and woman reconnect after a year of being apart, make out in a field, hear scary sounds and run back home.  A woman slaps another woman upstairs for... family reasons?  One woman didn't think she was loved enough I guess.  The husband and wife talk about their first date and how the wife didn't know what to think.  After this the mother almost faints in the kitchen.  A brother comes in screaming that his brother is dead.  Not sure how it happened but the one woman is distraught.

A pregnant woman tells her young son to behave and he disappears when she goes to hug him.  She falls to the floor and gives birth while a monster crawls by to help with the delivery.  The grandson appears in front of a grandmother then she dies.  Did she die from natural causes?  It would seem that way because the boy didn't do anything to make her die.  The two women who got into it earlier grab annd strangle each other.  Okay the one girl's screams are really good I admit.  A woman's hand glows on the TV screen.  After this a woman in bed just dies.  No suspense or anything.  Is this the story?  People just die suddenly? Oh geez!

The family hear sounds upstairs.  The picture on TV turns black and white as we see a woman with dark figures behind her.  A man lies on the floor and asks everyone to leave him alone so he can depart in peace.  The woman closes the cabinet door on the floor so he can rest.  The family suddenly sees words on a wall, hears loud roaring and runs downstairs.  Outside a crazy man walks strangely in the fog while the one woman shoots him.  By this point the killings improve and the movie gets better for sure, but the story?  Don't even try to make sense of this mess for real.

The husband and wife talk about a woman who asked the husband if he wants to see a magic trick.  We see a woman in a field sprinkling powder all over everything and reaching for the sky so it can rain dead black birds.  A gust of wind then blows all the blackbirds away.  This woman was satisfied and ecstatic.  It scared the husband to his bones.  We find out a temple that specializes in demon's was built where this house stands.  The wife bought this land because she was talked into it.  The temple burned down and the cult that used to occupy it is gone.  The husband says he slept with that magic woman (named Michelle).  The wife asks if it was a spell or his decision to sleep with her.  He says he doesn't know.  He says 2 months ago everything went bad.  The husband prayed for more business at his coffee shop.  This Michelle woman made sure every other coffee shop owner was dead.  With Michelle around they are screwed.

The wife freaks out when she hears a growl that turns into an earthquake.  We see a huge hunk of moving flesh just appear on the kitchen table and be slapped on.  The husband screams.  Michelle couldn't fight the demons in the house.  Others were sacrificed.  The husband asks about the mutations.  After intercourse the bravest would castrate their groom.  The wife insists there must be a way to end this madness occurring in the house.  To break these spells a marked one must summon a soul of a special sacrifice and a 4-time request to let us go.  They need to a do a seance and summon the virgin.

During the seance the wife stands up and talks to her one relative.  Her husband talks to Michelle and says she can't hurt him anymore.  The husband and wife hug and afterwards the wife finds herself knocked out in the kitchen with furniture knocked around.  The husband and wife realize everyone in the house is gone.  The wife says ""Don't you see?  We're next!"" after the husband questions what's going on.  The wife and husband sit around for a while until the husband finds himself cut up and lying on a bed.  The wife grabs a lamp and walks away.  She returns to talk about the TV being on despite the power being off.  She says she didn't mean to scare her husband.  The wife wants a hug.  She has sex with her husband until her relative screams in another room.  We now see the ritual taking place.  The wife was a member.  Suddenly a boy walks in.  We see all the girls who were part of the ritual.  The message we saw earlier on the wall appears on the floor, as the movie ends.

This is a bad movie.  For the most part the characters sit around mumbling in a dark hard to see room so you can't see them.  They even walk around holding lights so there's no excuse for the darkness.  You can't hear what's going on either, and even if you can hardly anything storyline-related or constructive is being said until the final 20 minutes.  By that point the storyline is just a mess of confusion.  For the most part we see people freaking out for unexplainable reasons or talking to each other like regular folks.  This movie doesn't even try to tell a story.  It's just characters having conversations with each other whenever they want.  Avoid."
1867,4.0,"""From the other side of the road, someone will come to get me"" - One of the initial lines of dialogue spoken by title character Hanna, also later on known as Hatchin, sometime in the middle of the first episode. She's contemplating running away, even though she knows it's a certain death.

In the very next scene, a dark somber mood hangs over our Hanna as she's forced to slave yet another day under grotesque and abusive foster parents. Suddenly, while at the dinner table, a raging green bike [Pictured on the cover of this Blu-Ray boxed set] slams through the window and lands right on top of the dinner table's occupants. A tan-skinned sex diva, clad in tight and seductive clothing, slams her foot on the table, bringing fear to the startled family's eyes. She takes a moment to lower her bulky sunglasses, and then analyzes every terrified occupant's face with piercing eyes; scanning each and every person- she looks for features that resemble a picture of a little baby girl she knows as Hannah. Her eyes settle on a timid girl with bushy white hair.

""Come on Hannah"" She says softly, and reaches out her hand. Hannah, looking at the hand, hesitates a moment. She feels scared. She doesn't even know who this person is. She fears her, and yet...admires her transient beauty and daring composure. Reaching out, she takes this stranger's hand. In a sudden and haphazard motion, this woman (whose name we later learn is Michiko) jerks Hatchin onto her bike. Gunshots start ringing out from police outside as well as, surprisingly, a money-hungry priest wielding a shotgun. Just as she had come in, this woman jerks her motorbike around in a 360 degree motion and explodes out into the world.

By taking this woman's hand, whose name Hatchin quickly learns is Michiko, she begins a personal and physical odyssey that will see them connect in ways unseen before in any anime. For those that want to witness the rest of their journey. This is it.

----------

Let's make something clear: this show is not for everyone, and that is this show's biggest problem because it advertises itself as a very accessible show complete with action, gunslinging hot babes, and underworld criminal activity.

I'm not a fan of highlighting a show's negative points first, but I want to make myself clear again. This show's biggest problem is that it advertises itself as a fun, action oriented Black Lagoon-type anime, even featuring a primary character that bares striking resemblance to Revy. However, this is simply not the case. It's...deeper then that. The true reality is that only those willing to undertake a slow and episodic story which focuses on its characters' inner conflicts, rather than external ones, will be the viewers who truly enjoy this anime the most. This fact is a shame considering the show's best characteristics lie within its presentation: graphics, animation, choreography, music. Very similar to most other high-caliber action series. Even so, let me be clear once more in saying that the interaction and story between the primary two characters takes massive precedent over everything else in this TV series. (That's three times I've stated that idea now.)

If the premise of this show doesn't click with you, you aren't going to like this series. Period. End of story. The product description gives the simple gist that this is an adventure show featuring a sex deva and an awkward young girl bound together in their struggle to locate a man important to both of their pasts. Take that gist at face value. If that storyline doesn't sound appealing than you should probably avoid this series, and will especially regret purchasing this expensive boxed set later on. Personally, having already witnessed masterpieces such as Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon, I thought this show seemed somewhat outclassed. Close. So very close. Equal in everything else except story, but no cigar. By itself the show could by all means can be considered great. I can hardly argue with people that think so...If you are one of those people by all means consider this series five stars. More power to ya, I say. I myself remain firm.

The bottom line is that this show's story can appeal to you or it can not. For me, it just didn't click. To me this show's story just seemed like an inferior version of the anime Samurai Champloo, which featured a near identical overarching storyline and similar-type characters. (Also made courtesy of studio Manglobe and director Shinichir' Watanabe) In both shows we see our primary characters scouring a country looking for a mysterious character relevant to all of their pasts. In Champloo it was the enigmatic Sunflower Samurai. In this show it ended up being what appeared to a random guy named Hiroshi Morenos. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why this man could be so significant to the main characters. Some may feel that what I'm about to say is (or saying) something of a spoiler, but I honestly do not feel this way. I'd argue it's important to state the facts about what the show is about so potential fans/customers know what it is about. Here's how I interpreted it. To me, this show felt constrained in that the story was about the relationship between Michiko and [I think?] her daughter Hatchin in what was almost like a slice-of-life show, but was overall trapped within the setting and presentation of a high-caliber action anime. If you are anything like myself, or otherwise follow the message I am trying to portray: you will understand that when I say that the overarching storyline ended up being completely mediocre and flat in it's conclusion, you will know I'm saying that to protect you from wasting your time, money, and most of all expectation (Which is worth more than money) that they are getting something different. In Champloo it culminated in an explosive and heart-pounding finale that elevated what had previously been a mostly episodic and strictly B story to near-Cowboy Bebop level (legendary) status.

This show? Not so much. The finale of Mitchiko to Hatchin isn't nearly as decisive as either Champloo or Bebop. There's action, sure. But the action in the final episodes of this series is no different or more suspenseful than anything the viewer sees throughout the previous to the final episodes. In fact, I'd argue the best action scenes featuring Mitchiko were actually in the beginning of the entire series (in the first few episodes) rather than the end. Besides that, I'd argue the best action scene of the last episodes of the series didn't even feature Mitchiko, but a side character...Who but one episode after [Slight spoilers] an amazing last stand goes on to be killed off and forgotten in the extended storyline, regardless. [/End Spoilers**] I don't know. To me, that seemed something of a waste. As for the title character Mitchiko, once she ""rescues"" Hatchin after her initial escape from a prison in the first couple episodes she holds on to a moral compass for the sake of Hatchin. Again, understandable for sure, but still nonetheless disappointing when compared to other action shows' main characters such as Revy from Black Lagoon, Spike from Cowboy Bebop, and/or Mugen from Samurai Champloo. Some would say that this fact makes this show distinctive, which is a perfectly fine opinion, but I feel compelled to state that I was disappointed.

If you want a summary than this is it: as an action-oriented fan that came expecting something that presented itself so different; it felt like that I had been shot through the heart when those expectations didn't follow through. I remembering feeling almost ripped off but not quite. Instead I felt...somber. I'm enough of an anime veteran and have seen enough series to no longer get so upset at situations such as these, especially considering that (unlike many other anime series these days) there is a definitive conclusion..But I can't say for sure how I really feel about it. I can say this, though. I didn't love it. I can also very easily see such a disappointment devastating another newer or unsuspecting fan. Do not be mistaken, there are small moments of glory scattered throughout the series, particularly in the episode I listed below, but it is not nearly enough so that one seeking Hellsing Ultimate/Black Lagoon level action leaves satisfied.

[*SPOILERS- LOOK AWAY!**] For those veteran fans that are wondering, I'm referring to the final standoff between Satoshi Batista and Shinsuke Saci Rodriguez in Episode 20: Rendezvous of Extermination [/End Spoilers]

The show gives many hints in the forms of flashbacks and lines of dialogue throughout the series as to just who the ""mysterious"" main character is. Lines of dialogue are dropped, some flashbacks are thrown in that do add some substance to him. However this character, named Hiroshi Morenos, to me felt very unsatisfying. As a writer and longtime connesiuer of written fiction I could have easily thrown in a couple plot devices that would have made this character much more interesting, but as it stands it is in vain. This show did very much feel like a spiritual successor of sorts to Champloo, but the show's story just didn't seem quite ambitious enough to escape Champloo's shadow. If you've already seen Samurai Champloo in particular, you are proabably going to be somewhat disappointed with this show. Based off story alone, I would have given this show a measly three stars. The conclusion and supposed climax, unlike Samurai Champloo which was explosive and its best part, turned out to be very anti-climatical except for a single sub-plot that involved Hiroshi Morenos' old criminal associates. [Which actually did end up being very reminiscent of Gungrave or Black Lagoon.] If only these subplots had been expanded...Alas, the lost potential.

Yes, therein lies a sort of contradiction this show fails to address. This show has got some /serious talent behind it. I mean really, Manglobe did a bloody fantastic job in the technical department; this is easily one of the best anime I've ever seen visually. Very rarely do I change a rating of a show based off its animation, choreography, or music. This show features all three exceptionally. For that reason and that reason alone, I felt compelled to add a star. Words can not overstate just how great many of those recently-stated characteristics are. The environments are drawn beautifully, the animation is so smooth, and it was an absolute pleasure to behold on my 42'' LG 1080P TV played through my PS3 and my 5.1 surround sound. In fact, for that reason alone I could see myself putting this show back on again. Speaking strictly about the show, it really was truly enchanting at times, but oh so underwhelming in others. It leaves one feeling a striking sense of lost potential which will leave you playing the ""What-If"" game in your mind for days after. I do not regret watching this show, nor do I regret buying it...but I do regret holding high expectations for it. Perhaps the biggest shocker was at how the trailer does not live up to the story. At least after the first couple episodes. Shame on me for believing a trailer and editorials, I guess.

Anyways, getting off such a somber rant. Let's talk about the audio for a moment; the sound of this story is backed by the famous Shinichir' Watanabe, who primarily served as a this series' music producer. It's freaking fantastic. This is rare for me, but numerous times I felt myself stopping and just...listening. To the opening song or end credits. The setting of this story is mostly contained to unnamed Latin American countrysides and cities, and the audio reflects that. I suspect it is meant to be in Mexico, because it (**Slight spoiler!**) references different characters ""crossing the border"" (**/End Spoiler**) a couple times throughout the anime, but it could just as well be set within Brazil or any other South American country. The precise location and whether the country/setting is fictional or not is never made clear. Personally, I thought this was a good thing. By keeping the setting primarily fictional it helps keep most viewers [including myself] more detached from reality and better helps each viewer submerse themselves into the plot of the show. Seeing as this show's story as a whole, which just barley hung in the balance in keeping my attention, attachable. This may have well been one of those ""small"" factors that allowed me to rate this series as highly as I did. Change one of these small factors and I might have given up on this series. (Let's just say it walked a thin line.) For other viewers it might be under the bar, those viewers will give up on this series and/or view it negatively; while other viewers still will see it set way above the bar, and hold it amongst the best anime ever made. Once again, for me it was right on that thin line- but in keep mind I'm one who tends to appreciate smaller details. For this reason I go back and forth.

I could probably go on and on rambling about this series, but let's leave it with a little game. Read the following quote.

""Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day, listening to the murmur of the water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is by no means a waste of time.""

' John Lubbock, The Use Of Life

Read that quote again. (Slowly this time.) Try to take in its deeper meaning. If you find yourself connecting with the quote and pondering it's inner meaning, chances are you are likely just the kind of person that will enjoy this series. If such is the case: waste not a second more. Order this series immediately. If instead you skimmed the quote, thought about it merely a moment, and skipped to this paragraph: go ahead and skip pass this anime. Instead, I would refer you to go watch a show called ""Lupin the Third: A Woman Called Fujiko Mine."" or ""Samurai Champloo""- if you haven't already seen them.

Thank you for reading this review. It's my first one in a while. I rate this series a rock solid 4 stars, or a score of 8 out of 10. Good luck to you, fellow fans, and always remember Funimation's motto. ""You should be watching"".

Remember there's always something out there for everyone.

1868,3.0,"A movie with a cast of unknowns, granted one has the same last name and a sort of resemblance to his more famous brother Alec, but for me I'd never seen any of these actors in anything before.  Which should make it a better movie, since you straight away can buy that they are the characters they are playing on the screen.  It's a movie that starts off all right, basically Emily an actress is kidnapped and hung up in a warehouse or something in a clear bodybag, where unspeakable things are done to her while hanging and worse when she's brought down.  Then the movie decides that sort of movie isn't what it wants to be anymore, the bad guy leaves (an anonymous call is given to the cops) and they turn up.  She returns to her normal life only you can't go through something like that and live like nothing has happened.  She turns down roles, and basically starts seeing people under the bed and at windows. She's freaking out so her husband a psychiatrist takes her to a remote mansion which belongs to a friend of a friend of a friend, so no one, especially the kidnapper will know where she is.  Emily tries to get on with her life again there, but her reputation in the industry has gone.  She tries to undo things by accepting parts she's turned down, or offering to do small supporting roles only to learn no one's interested in her at all now.  One night one of the people she sees/hears at the window outside turns out to be real.  A teenage girl has turned up seeking help as her boyfriend has just fallen off a cliff.  Emily doesn't want to be burdened with her.  She especially doesn't want Sarah living in the mansion getting help from her husband, who the girl has bonded with during the trauma and he sees it as his professional obligation to help the young girl in need. Emily becomes paranoid that her husband is having an affair with the younger much more attractive girl who doesn't seem to have a filter in asking questions or telling Emily how she things sings in relation to her life."
1869,3.0,"I have to tell you the truth: I don't remember the Fab Five all that much even though I saw the National Championship game when Chris Webber called the infamous time-out.

Since then, the Fab Five had disappeared. As Bobby Knight (3-1 then and now the record is nonexistent as the games were forfeited, against the Fab Five) stated, they were one of the most overrated teams in the history (never won a Big Ten title), and now, they never existed since their records had been wiped out clean due to the scandals surrounding the team in terms of money exchanges.

A lot of the documentary felt like an excuse for the Fab Five minus the most guilty party to condone their actions. Well, they cheated, plain and simple. And no, they weren't that good. I saw that Duke team with Laettner, Hurley, and Hill to demolish the Fab Five in the National Championship game the year prior to the North Carolina game, and it wasn't even that much of a game for Duke. And no, the Fab Five wasn't even that good.

Probably the worst aspect of the documentary was how the Fab Five minus the most guilty party trash talked Duke using one word names, never beating them once (didn't matter anymore since the games had resulted in forfeits). The players of the Fab Five had absolutely no right to call the black players who played for Duke as Uncle Toms.

The backward racism was the most ruinous aspect of the documentary. That's exactly how I remembered the Fab Five players: arrogant, self-absorbed, overrated, and absolutely spoiled. Again, they weren't that good. Duke had beaten them all of the three times they played each other. And look at how they sobbed and trashed their way to the locker room after each national championship loss.

The documentary was largely one sided: no perspectives from anyone else who went against the Fab Five. They probably couldn't handle the criticism like how they did back then.

All in all, the Fab Five never existed, and they remained forever the shame of University of Michigan Wolverines sport history as the school refused to acknowledge the squad. And the former Duke Blue Devils can laugh about that fact today. Instead, the time should have been spent in making a documentary about one of the greatest games ever played in the history of NCAA basketball: the 1992 East Regional Final between Duke and Kentucky. And pssssstt: Mitch Albom is a freaking liar."
1870,5.0,"Finally, a show about idiots, and 3 women in the lead roles! Jessica Knappett is a freaking GENIUS!!! Bill & Ted, Silicone Valley, That 70's Show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld, The Wayans Brothers, Martin, Bernie Mac--if anything in the list appeals to you at all, you will love this show! It may be a little uncomfortable for some at first, because we are conditioned to accept and expect women in such roles to be lampooned, for it to be no more than a cheap, misogynistic burlesque.

This hilarious show is no joke. Well, not at women's expense, anyway. Don't let anyone convince you that simply because a show was created, written, and directed by a woman that it was not at women's expense--including hers. ""Feminist"" porn comes to mind. (I say this as a psychologist.)

You have GOT to see this wonderful hot mess!!! Like the goddesses in Absolutely Fabulous, these losers remind me of myself and my friends."
1871,4.0,"I am a huge fan of the old NWA and WCW and was very excited when this set was scheduled to come out.  There are some hits and misses but mostly they are hits.  It should be noted that these are just PPV matches so you won't see any matches from older Great American Bashes or older Starrcade's because they weren't on PPV at that time.  Let's get started.

Up first is a match from the very first PPV that the NWA did in 1987.  It was the world title cage match between Ronnie Garvin and Ric Flair in Chicago at Starrcade.  First of all, I have never and will never understand how Garvin was put over as a world champion.  Next, I believe that the NWA made a huge mistake by having this event come from Chicago because Flair was over huge there and the NWA didn't want that.  They were trying to branch out like WWE but they should have stayed in the Greensboro area for this one.  Now the match is pretty good, not as good as the match they had in Detroit a few months earlier where Garvin beat him for the belt, but it was pretty good.  There was some good back and forth and some excellent cage work from the top rope but it just wasn't as good as you would think it would be.  The best part was seeing Flair win his 5th world title in this bloody affair, a title that he would hold for over a year and a half.

The next match is from Great American Bash 1988 and featured Barry Windham defending the US title against Dusty Rhodes.  I have often felt that Barry may have been one of the most underrated wrestlers of all time but you wouldn't know it if you watch this awesome contest.  This was a great match from start to finish and did feature Barry retaining the title in a 15 minute classic.  I have never been a huge Dusty fan so any time that I got to see him lose I was happy.  Needless to say, I was happy when he lost at this one.

The next match was a dream match of sorts and saw The Road Warriors defending the tag titles against Dusty Rhodes and Sting at Starrcade 1988.  This match was just fantastic and I remember loving it as a kid because 3 out of the 4 contestants involved were some of my favorites.  The build up to the match was just classic as The Warriors would turn on Dusty in violent fashion.  I remember them just destroying Dusty and then removing one of their spikes of of their shoulder pads and stabbing Dusty in the eye with it.  Sting would get involved and thus we have a match set.  The match had everything from speed to power moves to aerial moves but the DQ finish at the end kind of ruins it for me.  I would have loved to have seen a clear cut winner.  Still, it is a good contest.

The next match is an instant classic and features Ric Flair defending his world title against Ricky Steamboat at the Chi-Town Rumble in 1989.  Most people consider this one of the greatest matches of all time and of course this was the first match in their great 3 match trilogy in 1989.  I think this was the weakest of the 3 (now that's saying something) but it was still a fantastic contest.  It is short clocking in at  a mere 23 minutes but it was a back and forth classic that saw the highs and lows of a great wrestling contest.  It was a bit of a shock to see Ricky claim the world title but still, it was a great contest.

The next match was a US title showdown between champion Lex Luger and challenger Brian Pillman at Halloween Havoc 1989.  To me, this was a surprise choice to put on here.  I would have put on the Thunderdome match but this is still a great match.  Pillman was, to a degree, at the height of his career here.  He really pushed Luger to the limit and there were moments when I thought he was going to win the title but Luger proved to be just a little bit too much for him.  This is a great 16 minute contest.

The last match off of disc 1 is the world title match between Ric Flair and Sting from Great American Bash 1990.  This match should be retired because it is on so many other DVD sets.  I honestly think if I was choosing a match from 1990, I would have picked the title match between Luger and Flair from Wrestle War 1990.  Now that was a great 40 minute contest.  This match here is good with Sting picking up the big win but I have seen it too many times now that it has kind of lost its luster to me.  If you have never seen this match then I think you will enjoy it.

The first match on disc 2 was to crown a new WCW world champion.  It saw US champion Lex Luger battle Barry Windham in a cage match at Great American Bash 1991.  Ric Flair was supposed to take on Barry here and drop the world title to him but he left due to some disputes within the company and took the world title with him so they had a tournament and these were the final two to battle it out to become new world champion.  Honestly, this match is kind of boring.  There is really nothing to look forward to.  I was looking forward to a classic but just about every time that I watch it, I fall asleep.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that Barry hated Luger at the time and maybe he didn't want to make Luger look good, I don't know.

The next match is a great contest for the Light Heavyweight title as Jushin Liger battled Brian Pillman at Super Brawl II.  I remember when I saw this match as a young kid that I had never quite seen a match like this (if you watch it now, you wouldn't be as impressed).  However, place yourself back in 1992 and you have to be impressed.  Liger did things back then that no one really had ever seen before.  I mean it was such a great match that it was actually runner up for PWI's Match of the Year that year.  This is just a fun match.

The next match was a War Games match from Wrestle War 1992 and saw the Dangerous Alliance taking on Sting's Squadron.  I have to say that this War Games match may be the greatest of them it all.  It had everything from blood, to violence to ropes being taken down to people climbing on top of the cage and guys getting their heads shoved down in between the two rings.  This match was just awesome from start to finish.  As a side note this match does feature a young Steve Austin before his Stone Cold days and a young Dustin Rhodes before his Goldust days and it also featured the return of Nikita Koloff to his babyface days.

The next match was a unique contest as Vader battled Cactus Jack in a Spin the Wheel, Make the Deal match.  This was a non-title match and was unique because you had to spin a wheel to determine what type of match you would battle in.  Now, this match kind of failed at the previous Halloween Havoc as Sting spun the wheel against Jake Roberts and a Coal Miner's Glove was chosen.  What followed that year was one of the worst matches in Sting's career so it was surprising that they tried it again at Halloween Havoc in 1993.  Cactus would spin the wheel and he chose a Texas Death Match.  Basically in this match there are no rules.  You can pin an opponent but when you do the match is not over.  Once a pin occurs you have till a count of 10 to get back on your feet.  If you do, the match continues, if not it's over.  This was a fantastic contest and brutal.  Vader got busted open during the match and Cactus took a beating.  I remember there was one point when they battled down in this grave that had been set up and Vader got the winning end of it.  To see a bloody Vader walking out of the grave among the fog and lights was just great.  The match ended kind of dumb but it was still a great contest.

The next match was a US title match from Bash at the Beach 1994 between Steve Austin and Ricky Steamboat.  It should be noted that this match took place on my birthday and this was my favorite match on the card.  Austin has always said that Ricky was his favorite opponent and that this match may have been his favorite one with him.  I have seen most of their matches together and this is my favorite one they had.  It went for well over 20 minutes and was just a fantastic wrestling match.  I remember at one time my friends and I were talking and someone asked who I thought the next Ric Flair was going to be and I actually thought it would be Austin just because of how technical he was in the ring at this time.  This was just a fun match from start to finish.

The last match on disc 2 was from Halloween Havoc 1994 and it saw Hulk Hogan defend his world title against Ric Flair  The match was for the world title, in a cage, with Mr. T. as the special referee and both men's careers were on the line.  This match was pretty good but not near as good as their Bash at the Beach match they had a few months prior.  This match had too much going on.  For one thing, there was this side story as to who this masked man was that kept attacking Hogan in the months prior to this match.  For another thing, Mr. T. was just annoying during the match.  I mean there comes a point where T is knocked out and handcuffed to the ropes, then Sherri gets involved, then the masked man and Hogan still wins the freaking thing.  Now if I was booking this I would have had Hogan leave and Flair play it up like he was really retiring and give him a farewell but no, WCW just lets Flair leave so we can see that the masked man who has been attacking Hogan all these weeks was his friend Brutus Beefcake.  Big whoop!!  I think all of that just kind of took away from the match.

The first match from Disc 3 was the big hostile takeover match from Bash at the Beach 1996.  It saw Sting, Lex Luger and Randy Savage team up to take on the team of Hall and Nash, the Outsiders.  This was actually a great match with Luger down early to make it a two on two match.  I remember as a kid the whole time I was thinking who is the 3rd guy that the Outsiders had in their back pocket but that did not take away from the match.  It was a great contest with Hogan coming out at the end and showing that he was the 3rd man.  I have heard that had Hogan decided not to become a heel and do that turn then Sting would have been the 3rd man.  I think Hogan was the perfect choice and just think had Sting decided to do it, we may never have gotten to see the Crow Sting.

The next match was from Spring Stampeded 1997 and saw DDP take on Randy Savage in a no DQ match.  This was a great contest and to me this match really helped to solidify DDP as a main player in WCW as Savage actually took the fall for DDP.  I loved their feud this year and this match was a great way to get the feud off and running.  They fought everywhere including this little prop area that had set up to look like a picnic area.  It was just a great match.

The next match is one of my favorite matches of all time and features Eddie Guerrero defending his Cruiserweight title against the mask of Rey Mysterio at Halloween Havoc 1997.  This match has to be seen to be believed.  It is an unbelievable contest and features some of the wildest moves ever in a match.  It is a near flawless contest and came very close to winning the PWI match of the year award that year.  This match is my all time favorite Cruiserweight or Junior Heavyweight match that I have ever seen.  I have seen it more times than I can count but it never gets old to me.  To me, at this time in WCW, there were two things keeping the company afloat:  The NWO along with Sting and the Cruiserweights and after seeing this match you can tell these two were defiantly helpful into keeping the company afloat.

The next match was a contest from Slamboree 1998 between Randy Savage and Bret Hart with Roddy Piper as special referee.  I was looking forward to this one but it kind of disappointed.  They just didn't have the chemistry that I was hoping for.  Savage was starting to fade out at this time and Bret just wasn't what he was in the WWE.  The match wasn't a total stinker but it could have very easily been that.  Not a good match to put on here.

The next match was a good one as Chris Jericho defended his Cruiserweight title against Juventud Guerrera with Dean Malenko as the special referee.  This is a great contest that has the high flying, of course, but it also has a great story behind it.  See, a few months earlier, Jericho had actually taken Guerrea's mask and with it, Juvi's identity so he was out for revenge.  Jericho and Dean had no love lost for each other either so Dean was looking for revenge also.  The match was just great.  It had drama and action and no one gets under your skin more quickly than Jericho (that's why he is so freaking good).  To see him drop the belt here in a 16 minute classic was just fantastic.

The next match Goldberg defending his world title and streak against DDP at Halloween Havoc 1998.  This is, to me, perhaps Goldberg's best match of his career.  I remember some people didn't get to see this match because the PPV started to become an epic and ran over its allotted time so some cable providers shut it off before this main event match could be played.  For those who did get to see it, they got to see a pretty damn good 11 minute match.  I mean Goldberg was doing stuff in this match that people had never seen him do before and DDP was looking like he was going to walk out world champion at any moment.  This was just a stellar contest and I believe it actually won WCW's match of the year.  It was so ironic that this event featured their match of the year and also most people's worst match of the year as Warrior took on Hogan.  Thank God the WWE decided not to put that match on this set.

The next match is a world title match as Jeff Jarrett and Booker T. battle to see who will win the vacant world title at Bash at the Beach 2000.  Oh man, where to begin here.  The match was supposed to feature Jarrett defending his title against Hogan.  Hogan of course wanted the title and he had creative control to make that happen.  Vince Russo, who was booking, didn't want that to happen so he had Jarrett go out and lay down for Hogan.  Hogan pinned him and then him and Russo got into a verbal exchange the likes of which wrestling fans had never heard before.  It got a little too real.  So I guess they stripped Hogan of the belt and then a few matches later they had Jarrett and Booker go out and have a match to crown a new champion.  This was a very good contest and may have been one of Jarrett's best in the company.  Booker finally makes it to the big time and becomes world champion.  This was a great feel good moment for me.  I have always felt that Booker should go down as the greatest African American wrestler of all time (or so far) and one of the greatest of all time as well and I was so happy for him when he won the belt here.  This is a great match.

The next match is a ladder match from Starrcade 2000 and featured the Jung Dragons battling Shannon Moore and Shane Helms battling Jamie Knoble and Evan Karagias.  Honestly, I think this match is a little overrated.  I mean it's good but it's not that good.  People talk about it all time but it has nothing against some of the great ladder matches that you may have seen over the years.  I'm just not that big of a fan of the match, however, I will say that it was probably the best match from the Starrcade 2000 line up.

The last match on the set is from the last PPV in WCW existence.  It was an event called Greed and it was a Falls Count Anywhere match for the world title.  It saw Scott Steiner defend the title against DDP.  The match is just not that good.  Not even DDP could save it.  Steiner was just a terrible champion at this time and he just could not do a good job putting together a classic wrestling match.  DDP tried his hardest as he always does but he just could not save the match unfortunately.

The Blu Ray matches were not very good choices.  The first one is from Halloween Havoc 1989 and it was that Thunderdome cage match I mentioned earlier with Ric Flair and Sting teaming up to take on Great Muta and Terry Funk.  This was a killer match from start to finish.  Sting was kind of the MVP here.  He was doing things that just shouldn't be done in this type of cage match.  I want to say that the match ended when it appeared that Gary Hart threw in the towel for Muta and Funk, so that was kind of dumb but the rest of the match is just a fantastic contest.

The next BR match was Triple H, when he was wrestling as Jean-Paul Levesque took on Alex Wright in possibly his only WCW PPV match at Starrcade 1994.  The match was actually pretty good but not as good as you would think.

The next BR match was a match with basketball player Dennis Rodman taking on Randy Savage at Road Wild 1999.  Rodman had came onto the scene in 1997, I believe, and he turned out some truly good performances.  This match was different.  This match just wasn't all that good and honestly should never have been added to the disc set.  It was 11 minutes that was a waste of time.

The last BR match was a match between Hulk Hogan and Billy Kidman from Slamboree 2000.  It had Eric Bischoff as the guest referee.  I think at the time that this WCW's chance to do what WWE had done 3 years and start to pump some new blood into the organization.  However, I do not feel that Kidman was the way to go with Hogan.  I mean this Hogan for the love of God!  This was a guy who had battled some of the best on the some of the greatest cards of all time and you're gonna try to have Kidman of all people beat him.  It just wasn't a good move on their part and Hogan wasn't going to let it happen anyway so what was the point?  At this time, I don't know who they could have built up to beat someone like Hogan.  The match itself actually wasn't half bad with Kidman holding his own.  It was just kind of those all for naught type things though.

All in all this was a very good DVD set.  It does say that it is volume 1 so here's hoping that a volume 2 will be following sometime soon.  There are some great one's that could have been included in this set but maybe they will appear on the next one.  This is one that is worth checking out though."
1872,5.0,"Rifftrax is amazing.  I always laugh out loud, whether it is a shorts collection such as this one or one of their movie commentaries.  So freaking funny."
1873,4.0,"The Visitant is about a fake fortune teller lady named Samantha who pretends to legitimately read people's fortunes.  She's a scammer.  She takes people's money and tells them lies.  The joke she plays on a boyfriend/girlfriend only to find out they're brother and sister is pretty cruel.  She take out a skull body of a baby raccoon but acts like it's a puppy only for it to pop in the air.  This frightens the brother and especially the sister since she's already traumatized over losing her puppy.  After this a strange woman walks in and claims she hasn't slept in a year, and that she's being tormented by a ghost.  Samantha the fortune teller tries to act legitimate when she wishes the evil spirit away but... when the woman grabs Samantha's hands she seemingly snaps out of the reading and the woman is suddenly gone, leaving the fortune teller with a bloody nose.

When Samantha leaves and tries to back out of the parking lot she runs over something invisible.  Suddenly a baseball game comes on her car radio.  Looks like she's being tormented by the same ghost who was just tormenting the woman!  Samantha comes home, plays with her bird, gets the mail, walks inside, closes the blinds, walks to the bathroom and takes off her fortune teller make up and contacts which changes her looks in a really big way.  When she picks up the phone and talks to her friend, she mentions how everyone in the fortune teller room has a secret.  Samantha insists she isn't conning anyone but... she is!

She hears the piano playing by itself but it's just a gerbil walking across the keys.  Her friend brings up a guy (her boyfriend named Stephen) and how his art belongs in a museum.  The movie doesn't say what happened to the guy but we assume he died.  Then we see Stephen's art work while creepy music plays.

We now see Samantha coming home late at night from a jog to the sound of loud music filling her house.  She runs inside, turns the TV and music off.  At first I thought this segment was a nightmare!  She talks to her friend again on the phone.  Samantha thinks it's a power surge that caused the chaos and loud music but her friend thinks it's telekinesis.  Samantha fiddles with a knob and hears a weird ghost sound which scares her.  Then she hears feet pounding upstairs.  She calls her friend back and heads upstairs.  The feet walking is actually the sound of the curtains flapping in the wind.  Samantha gets a shower and the letter S appears on her glass shower door.  She exits the bathroom and sees her antiques rattle.

While eating food and watching TV on the couch she sees shadows moving in the corner of her eye.  While drinking milk she hears a weird demonic scream and spits it out.  She unplugs the TV and, while it's easy to miss, those who pay close attention can see an image of a ghost in the TV while the static fades.  Cool effect there!  Samantha tries to call her friend but she doesn't pick up.  Instead she calls her shrink and he thinks she's having another one of her anxiety disorder attacks.  He thinks she's just having a memory which triggers the return of her symptoms.  She mentions how her boyfriend died a year ago today.  The shrink mentions the memory might be painful but it's just another day on the calendar.  He recommends getting rid of her boyfriend's art work so she can let him go.

As the conversation ends the shrink disappears as ghostly demons take over the computer monitor.  Samantha takes her medication and off to bed she goes.  She falls asleep while laying in bed reading a book only to wake up hearing banging coming from behind her bedroom door.  Well at first she wakes up in a dream and sees a strange soldier figure looking at her.  She screams ""Go away!"" and the door flies open.  Upon waking up (for real) and opening her bedroom door she sees a small figurine of the alien figure lying on the floor.  Samantha talks to her friend on the computer monitor.  She mentions she was talking to her shrink and that she was hearing things.

Her friend insists something spiritual is in the house and haunting the woman.  Her friend says ghosts don't care if people believe in them or not, and that she had a ghost in her house.  The two sort of joke it off. They have a lengthy discussion about ghosts.  While researching what a visitant is online, suddenly this horrible death metal noise screams through the computer speakers.  Oh man that music's bad!  It would scare me too.  Samantha walks around the house taking picture of her mirrors.  She slowly walks into her boyfriend's art room.  Some freaky art work indeed, including a giant centipede demon in black and white, and a Yoda-looking puppet.  She looks over the footage of the pictures she took, and while talking to her friend on the phone, her friend recommends looking for anything suspicious.

Suddenly the power goes off.  Samantha walks around in the dark looking for the circuit breakers.  She finds it and turns the power back on, but when she turns around the washing machine is filled with inflatable monsters.  When Samantha calls her friend, her friend says she tried calling Samantha for an hour.  Samantha says the inflatable monster in the washing machine was just upstairs and it doesn't make sense how it got down here.  Samantha chalks it up to the thing falling in the laundry basket.  She mentions the woman she had to deal with while working her phony fortune teller job, and thinks the spirit was released from the woman and attached itself to her.

Her friend recommends cleansing her house with smoked sage and walking around each room talking to the spirits.  Samantha finds a bowl to put the sage in.  Before this a glass falls in her hands when she opens the cabinet door.  That would freak me out but not Samantha apparently!  While walking around the house she says ""I need you to go away.  You're not wanted here"".  The TV comes on the moment Samantha leaves the room and we again see a monster in the static.  As she leaves the upstairs hallway her boyfriend's picture frame cracks.  Samantha screams ""Go away!"" when she hears pounding in the art room.  She panics when the smoked sage sets the smoke detector off.  She finds newspaper clippings about her boyfriend, and notices the name of the woman she had to deal with during the fortune teller incident is shown in the paper.  The lady handed Samantha a business card while getting her fortune read, and now Samantha's about to burn it.

Samantha suspects the woman killed her boyfriend in a hit and run incident and calls the woman and asks if she was drunk when she killed him. It's not a coincidence the woman visited a fortune teller a year after the death of Samantha's boyfriend.  The woman gets upset and says Samantha's boyfriend ran into a tree.  She witnessed him drive towards the tree like he was aiming for it.  The woman got out of her car and prayed for Samantha's boyfriend, but she felt the presence of a demon.  This demon followed the woman home and haunted her.  The woman insists Samantha's boyfriend is with her in the house.

Samantha lights a candle and tries to contact her boyfriend.  She apologizes for burning his sage and banishing him.  She begs him to come back.  She wants him to move the mask she placed on the floor.  He does.  She asks him to move the toy.  He does that as well.  Samantha panics and calls her friend.  She tells her friend the spirit is her boyfriend.  She doesn't believe Samantha and says she needs to be sure.  It might be another spirit- a darker one, according to Samantha's friend.

Samantha talks to her boyfriend- ""If you truly are Steven I open my heart to you.  I'm ready for you.  Let's connect"".  Just then the candle blows out and a harsh wind fills up the room.  Drawers bang open and drawings magically appear in the book.  Samantha says she doesn't understand what to do and insists ""I'm yours"".  The scrabble letters move around the floor and spell ""Steven"".  When the letters spell ""Steven"" instead of ""Stephen"" Samantha screams ""Hey, you're not Stephen!"" Then the spirit bangs the door into her ankle as she tries to run away.  When the door opens we see a SUPER scary demon running towards Samantha.  That's definitely a frightening scare there!  When the friend arrives she sees Samantha lying on the floor.  She holds her hand as the move ends.

A pretty good suspense.  The acting's surprisingly solid and the story's decent but there's not really a whole lot going on.  Nothing truly remarkable about this movie.  Perhaps the whole fortune teller part in the beginning was probably the movie's biggest mistake given how tacky it was done and how it made the movie look like a poor horror film, but I guess the scene was necessary to get the story rolling.  I think the movie relies too much on the constant phone conversations between Samantha and her friend.  All these phone calls reduce the suspense factor so the movie ends up looking like young girls freaking out by simple bumps in the night even though there really is a demon in the house.

Otherwise I enjoy the Visitant and would recommend it.  The story gets a lot better in the second half if you're willing to stick with it.  The demon activity is used sparsely which I like, as is the tease that this is the boyfriend of Samantha.  Samantha insists it's her boyfriend coming back to visit her, whereas her friend thinks it's a demon.  Perhaps it's odd that Samantha doesn't seem as torn up about the anniversary of her boyfriend's death as she should be, and the subject of her mental issues isn't brought to our attention very much either.  I still enjoy the film."
1874,5.0,Amazing... so freaking glad I watched it.
1875,5.0,"So I finally got this set and thought it would be fun to review it.  First off, I was a huge fan of the GAB events held back in the day so it was fun for me to go back in time and relive some of these matches all over again.

The first match is from the first GAB and featured Ric Flair defending the world title against Nikita Koloff on 7/6/85.  It should be noted here that Flair wrestled mostly as a heel at the time so it was weird to see him as a babyface taking on the dreaded Russian Koloff.  It should also be noted that Dusty Rhodes and Larry Zbyszko were doing commentary (not that great might I add).  I was actually wondering if this would be the complete match because I honestly have never seen the full contest.  I have only seen the clipped match that was featured on the Ring Masters VHS tape that was released back in the 80's.  I was VERY surprised to see that it was the full match.  These two have had some great one's and this one may have been one of their best.  It was just a great back and forth match with Flair getting busted open at one point during the match.  Flair was able to win but he had to go through hell to get the win.  As a side note, check out Flair's awesome entrance to the ring.  It has to be seen to be believed.

The next match is from 7/26/86 and was a number one contender's match for the tag titles.  It featured the Rock n' Roll Express taking on Ole and Arn Anderson.  At this time, the GAB wasn't just one event, it was a tour that they did.  If I'm not mistaken this match have came off of the last show of the tour.  It was a classic.  I used to love Ricky Morton from the Rock n' Roll's and he did not disappoint.  I was not that big of a fan of Robert Gibson but he kind of turned it up here as well.  Of course, Ole and Arn were their old selves, cutting the ring off and just punishing the RR's.  Great match but it was a shame that it had to end in a 20 minute draw.  I would have liked to have seen a clear cut winner.

The next match is from the same event on the tour and featured Ric Flair defending his world title against Dusty Rhodes in a cage match.  I have to say that I am not a huge fan of the Dusty/Flair matches that they had over the years.  I liked their feud with each other but not the matches.  This match is a killer contest and may have been the best match of the series (I believe it won Match of the Year for PWI magazine).  This was just as emotional of a match that you could get.  The fans really wanted to see Dusty pull it out.  Dusty poured his heart into this match and was able to win the match and the title in a great and bloody contest.

The next match is from 7/4/87 and it featured a new kind of match.  That match was the War Games match and saw Ric Flair, Tully Blanchard, Arn Anderson, Lex Luger and JJ Dillion taking on Dusty Rhodes, Nikita Koloff, The Road Warriors and Paul Ellering.  Again, in 1987, the GAB was a tour and on this leg of the tour, the fans would get to see something they had never seen before.  It would be two rings surrounded by one giant cage that had a top on it.  The rules were simple:  Two men would start for five minutes and then there would be a coin toss.  Whoever won (always the heels) would send in another man making it a 2 on 1 match for 2 minutes.  After that, the losing team of the coin toss would send in a man making it 2 on 2 for two minutes.  It would alternate like that until all men were in the ring and then it would be submit or surrender.  The match would end when someone would quit.  This was a hell of a match.  It had so much action and blood that it wasn't even funny.  I don't know who was the most impressive but boy was it fun to watch.  This match is just fantastic!

The last match on disc 1 is from 1988 and features Sting and Lex Luger taking on the Road Warriors.  In 1988, the NWA did do a GAB PPV but they also went on tour and this match was from the tour.  I thought this match was going to be great but it turned out to be kind of a bore.  I'm not sure why it was so boring, maybe the pacing which was kind of slow, but I can't quite place my finger on it.  I think if it would have been a faster pace it may have been much better.

The first match on disc 2 was a TV title match between Sting and Great Muta from 1989.  This was a fantastic contest!  To me, this was one of their best contests.  It was so good from start to finish.  I didn't like the ending, which was a double pin draw, but the rest of the match was just fantastic!  This was probably my favorite match from the whole event that year.  I can't say enough good things about it.

The next match was also from 1989 and featured Ric Flair defending his world title against Terry Funk.  These two had one hell of feud that year and it all began with Flair winning the world title from Ricky Steamboat at Wrestle War and Terry attacking Flair and piledriving him through a table.  This match was intense from start to finish and did not let up.  The chops from Flair are some of the most intense I have ever heard.  Terry is his usual crazy self here.  The match ends on a sour note, via DQ, but it is still worth watching.

Up next is another world title match and features Ric Flair defending against Sting.  This is a fun match to watch.  No one thought Sting was going to be in this match because in February of the same year he had blown his knee out and wasn't expected to be back by July to take on Flair.  Well, he made it back and the rest is history.  This was the start to Sting's rise to become one of the biggest stars ever.  The match itself is a little one sided with Sting dominating most of the 16 minute contest.  Still, it is fun to watch Sting win his world title and have Flair pass the torch.

The next match is from the same event and had the Steiners taking on the Freebirds.  I'm not sure why this match didn't take place before the last match because the last match was the main event of 1990 but anyway it was a good contest.  It was a 13 minute classic from both teams.  I feel that the Michael Haynes/Jimmy Garvin version of the Freebirds doesn't get enough credit.  I thought they were good and in some ways they were slightly better than the Haynes/Gordy/Roberts version.  This was a great back and forth match though and was just fun to watch.

The next match is from 1992.  For some reason, the WWE chose not to put a match on from 1991 on the DVD set.  They did add a match from that GAB on the Blu Ray.  The match from 1992 that they chose was a tag match between Steve Austin and Rick Rude taking on Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham.  This was a quarter final match in a tournament match to crown new NWA world champs.  At this time the company was still WCW but the NWA was back and wanted to see their tag titles and world title defended on shows.  This match was killer and went for nearly 20:00.  I have always felt that Rhodes and Windham were a very underrated team.  They proved it here (and that night wrestling in 3 matches that went for a combined hour).  They were great and picked up a hard fought win.  They would go on to wrestle 2 more times that night, making it to the finals against Terry Gordy and Steve Williams (The Miracle/Violence Connection) but would lose as Gordy and Williams would leave the PPV as NWA and WCW tag champs (they had won the WCW tag titles from the Steiners a few nights before this event).  That finals match is the one I wish they would have chosen from the DVD set but it was still great to see the match that they did pick.

The next match was a world title match and featured Sting defending his world title against Vader.  This match was also from 1992 and it was a killer match.  Vader was so dominate here it wasn't even funny.  He threw Sting all over the ring and just brutalized him from the opening to the merciful final bell when he finally defeated Sting for his world title.  I remember as a kid watching this match and just being in a state of shock.  I had never see anyone man handle Sting like Vader did.  This is just an enjoyable match (as all of their matches were) to watch.  This would be the last GAB for a few years.

Ok, so the GAB took a hiatus for 3 years and returned in 1995.  The match that was chosen from that event was the main event match between Randy Savage and Ric Flair and was the first match of Disc 3.  These two had started feuding with each other in the WWE over the world title there and Miss Elizabeth.  In 1995, their feud would escalate as Flair helped to beat down Savage's father Angelo Poffo.  This was supposed to be Randy's night for revenge but not everything went according to plan.  Flair stayed one step ahead and was able to pick up the win in a barn burner of a match.  I have seen a lot of their matches and this 14 minute match may have been my favorite just because everyone and I mean everyone thought that Randy was going to win this thing but Flair just pulled out a shocker.  Great stuff.

The next part of Disc 3 wasn't a match but a segment from 1996.  The segment was when Hall and Nash showed up to see if anyone from WCW had accepted their challenge.  Eric Bischoff decided to interview them and he said that he would give them an answer.  I guess he didn't give it to them fast enough because they powerbombed his rear end straight off a stage and through a table.  I think what made the segment work was how real it got.  I mean it got really real (Bishcoff even asked if they worked for the WWF) and it was a great shocker as well.

The next match was a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and DDP.  First off, this was a fantastic feud.  Their feud started with just a match at Spring Stampede where DDP picked up a surprise win and then Randy starts to provoke DDP with pictures of his wife Kim and that led to this match which was off the charts good.  These two never had a bad match and this one was definitely not a bad match.  This match was back and forth and a roller coaster of a contest.  I loved it.  It wasn't too violent but it was stellar.  Randy picked up the win here to tie the series up and after having a few other contests with each other (mostly tag matches) they would settle the score at Halloween Havoc in a Sudden Death match.  This match on this set though was great!

The next match was also from 1997 and it saw Ultimo Dragon taking on Psychosis.  This was a fantastic high flying contest and was actually the opener for GAB 1997.  It was a great way to start the show.  It was 14 minutes of high flying fast paced action.  I was a huge fan of Dragon and always had been since I saw him wrestle in Japan so it was fun to see him in this match and pick up the win.

The next 3 matches are all from 1998 and first up is Eddie Guerrero taking on his nephew Chavo Guerrero.  This is a long 14 minute match.  I say long because Eddie and Chavo, to me, never had any good chemistry with each other and their matches were usually long and boring and this one was no different.  It was a boring match that I never cared about.  The only good thing was the surprise ending which saw Chavo actually pick up the win.  The rest of the match is pretty forgettable.

The next match from 1998 is Chris Jericho taking on Dean Malenko for the vacant Cruiserweight title.  This was a far better match from the 1998 edition of GAB.  This was a fast paced match and was also a great wrestling match.  Dean was perhaps one of the best ""shooter"" style wrestlers I have ever seen and in this match he shows us just why that is.  It is a shame that the match ends in a DQ because it was so good up to that point but it is still worth viewing.

The final match from the 1998 edition of GAB was a tag team match that saw Hollywood Hogan team with Bret Hart to take on Roddy Piper and Randy Savage.  You know, 10 years or even 5 years prior to 1998 this would have been one hell of a match but in 1998 it was just an average match.  I wasn't into it all that much and I don't think most of the guys involved were into all that much into it either.  It was kind of an 11 minute bore but it was fun to see all these guys in the ring at the same time.  Other than that, this match is pretty forgettable.

The last 2 matches are from the 2000 edition of GAB and they weren't all that great.  The first one was an ambulance match between DDP and Mike Awesome.  It kind of just was a 10 minute bore fest to me and I hate saying that because I am a huge DDP fan but this contest just did not hold any type of interest to me whatsoever.  It could have been really good but this is when WCW was about to close so it's really no surprise.

The final match of the DVD set is a world title match with Jeff Jarrett defending the world title against Kevin Nash.  Man, I don't know what it was, but at this time in WCW it seemed like every freaking world title match had either Jarrett, DDP, Nash or Scott Steiner in it and with the exception of DDP none of the others were worth seeing.  This was a 17 minute piece of crap match.  Jarrett, to me, should go down as one of the worst world champions of all time and after seeing this match I think most people would agree with me.  He just can't work all that well.  Nash was pretty good in this match but still not as good as he could have been.  This was just a bad way to end the DVD set.

The Blu Ray matches were good picks.  They start with a cage match that featured Dusty Rhodes, Magnum TA and Baby Doll taking on The Midnight Express and Jim Cornette.  I love the Midnights and was glad to see them in a match because I feel they were sorely missing from the DVD set.  This is a pretty good contest but not as good as could have been expected.  I did like watching anytime TA and Bobby Eaton got into the ring but other than that it was a standard cage match.

The next BR match is from 1988 and saw Ric Flair defend the world title against Lex Luger.  This match was from the actual PPV of the GAB that year and not the tour.  This was a freaking good match.  For anyone who thought Luger couldn't work, they should watch this match.  He was just stellar in this match and had me believing he was going to win this thing and then he got busted open.  It wasn't a bad cut but he bled enough that the Maryland Athletic Commission stopped the match and Flair was given the win.  It was kind of a cheap way to end the match but it kept their great feud going for years.

The next BR match was from 1991 and it saw Sting and Nikita Koloff battling in a Russian Chain match.  This match built for a long time.  Nikita had came back to WCW in Feb. or so of 1991 and had brutally attacked Lex Luger after Luger successfully retained his US title.  Sting took exception to that and then in May at SuperBrawl it appeared that Nikita again was targeting Luger.  Sting moved him out of the way and he took a fist wrapped with a chain around it to his face.  That led to this match.  The 1991 edition of GAB had some really forgettable matches but this one always stood out to me because of how much I wanted to see Sting kick Nikita's rear end.  I was so shocked and still am to this day whenever I re-watch it, that Nikita was able to win.  I was also equally shocked that they never settled their feud on PPV.  They kind of had a blow off match on a Clash of the Champions event.  Still, this is a fun match to watch.

The next BR match is from 1996 and featured Ric Flair and Arn Anderson taking on NFL players Steve McMichael and Kevin Greene.  I remember when this match was signed I thought it was a joke.  I thought there was no way they would have these two football players actually be able to hold their own against two of the greatest of all times.  Mongo and Kevin actually did hold their own but they held it just a little too well.  I didn't agree with that but the match was still fun especially the end when the Horsemen offered Mongo a briefcase and a Horsemen shirt and he took the deal and turned on his partner.  That was classic.  This was a good match but I kind of wish they would have included the Cruiserweight title match with Dean Malenko and Rey Mysterio, which to me, was the match of the night.

The last BR match offered is a world title match that saw Kevin Nash defend the world title against Randy Savage.  I have to say, this match was a let down.  I can remember being ready for a war and what I got was a horrible 7 minute match that ended in a DQ!!  What a horrible way to end a PPV and what an even more horrible way to end a DVD set.

All in all, this is a killer set.  I was a huge fan and still am of the old NWA and WCW matches so I for one am looking forward to more of their collections (here's hoping for a Halloween Havoc and SuperBrawl set).  I think the set represents the GAB very well.  There are some matches I wish was on the set like:  Ric Flair taking on Jimmy Garvin in a world title cage match, Dusty Rhodes battling Tully Blanchard in a Barbed Wire Ladder match for $100,000, as mentioned before the NWA world title finals with Gordy and Williams taking on Rhodes and Windham from 1992, Sting taking on Meng for the vacant US title in 1995, the Chris Benoit/Kevin Sullivan match from 1996 where they went all over the building and even into the bathroom (I know they wouldn't because of Benoit but God it was good), I would have liked to have seen the Madusa/Akira Hokuto match for the women's title and Madusa's career, again I would loved to have seen another Benoit match as he took on Booker T in the final best of 7 match for the TV title in 1998 and finally I would have liked to have seen another Benoit match as he and Perry Saturn took on DDP and Kanyon for the Tag titles in a stellar match from 1999.  There would have been no matches from 2000 I would have liked to have seen.

So, in summary, if you haven't seen this set and you are a big fan of the old NWA and WCW then I would check this one out.  It's up there with the Starrcade set and the War Games set that was released.  One last thing, I am a little surprised that the WWE did not release any matches from their version of the GAB and The Bash.  That was something I was preparing myself for.  Anyway, once again, if you haven't checked this one out, it is well worth the price."
1876,5.0,"This show is freaking great. It's funny and silly and stupid and heartbreaking. A truly bizarre premise, which is that each of these brothers (and their Grandpa) are in fact Norse gods... sort of. But once you get past that, absolutely enjoyable."
1877,1.0,She's way past her prime here at 60 years old.  She can't move or sing like she once did.  She's dressed in all black and wearing a bad wig.  This isn't the colorful Cyndi Lauper from the 80s with iconic hairstyle by Patrick Lucas.  Shame there's no concert video of Cyndi when she was at her youthful best!  Imagine if the only concert footage we had of Taylor Swift is when she's 60 years old. Inexcusable!  All great artists deserve to be seen in their prime.  Especially Cyndi who was so freaking great in the 80s.  Where's the concert video from Cyndi's iconic 1984 Fun Tour for the She's So Unusual album with songs from Blue Angel?  Where's the concert video of 30 year old Cyndi in her prime?  Where?  This is so unfortunate.  It's just sad.  People have no idea how great this girl was in her prime because there is no complete footage from her 80s era concerts and now videos like this one of a 60 year old Cyndi just diminish her legacy so present and future generations will never know how great this girl was.  I'm crying.  Her iconic 1984 Fun Tour performance was a billion times better than what is shown here.
1878,5.0,I freaking love one piece
1879,5.0,Love it. Archer season 6 to add to my Archer collection. It's freaking funny as usual.
1880,5.0,"This show is freaking awesome!  I absolutely love anything on PBS because they truly make the most visually stunning shows and are right on par with historical accuracy.  The main actor is phenomenal.  He is so wells spoken, so compelling, so interesting that its impossible to not want to know what happens in the next episode.
Pro:
- Visually stunning
- The clothing and costume are a thing of beauty ( I want all the gowns!)
- Historically accurate and gets all the details right  (even the cosmetics are correct at the store)
- Easy to understand the actors and follow along
- You will want to teleport back to WWI and shop in their store
- The love stories are so well done be sure to have some Kleenex around
Con:
- The fourth season is the last season! 
- I don't get to shop at Mr. Selfridges"
1881,1.0,Holy s*** this movie is freaking terrible.  So weird.  Alternating POV and dialogue coming from nowhere.  This is actually an interesting story that was destroyed by some one trying to make an artsy fartsy film.  Super mad I payed money to watch this garbage and wasted a portion of my life enduring this train wreck of a film.  Boo!
1882,1.0,"WT******* so confused, and the last one omg....freaking weird and sick puke....."
1883,5.0,"This movie is freaking epic! Its not often a zombie movie is made where the zombies are kids. Secretly I bet teachers around the world get together before school starts, drink some white wine, and fantasize about being able to bash in a few students themselves."
1884,4.0,"It was way better than I though. I liked it, but it was pretty low budget. They did really good with what they had. These two brothers are funny. They fight and mess with each other like brothers do, but there are freaking zombies around. Pretty good action, but not to over the top."
1885,5.0,"I originally didn't have much interest in seeing this film, but once I did I freaking loved it and was laughing my ass off! I definitely recommend!"
1886,4.0,"why's freaking moriah on the cover? Doffy, sure, but moriah? Stil great though. I'm gonna collect them all."
1887,2.0,"Ehhhh...I got sick and tired of the same several subplots lumbering along: Bates, the freaking commie chauffeur and his bizarre wife, Evil Thomas, and other.

Also: Lady Cora S3-E1: Oh don't worry about me, Im an American, you know Have Gun Will Travel.... WTF????

WTF????

Whats THAT supposed to mean??"
1888,5.0,"Bunny is like a hybrid lovechild of the legendary Troma (Toxic Avenger and Poultrigiest) films and the early career of Peter Jackson (we're talking Bad Taste and Dead Alive here folks). Obviously intending to be way over the freaking top it starts off with some mysterious assailents capturing a man and injecting him with a serum that turns him into a hulking rabbit mutant with an enormous wang and an insatiable hunger for pussy (which he constantly bellows). From that point we are introduced to the cast of characters to be menaced. I found the majority of them while thinly written to be rather likable and even relatable at times.

The movie moves at a pretty brisk pace and I found it to be humurous with plenty of gore to satisfy the needs of the horror enthusiast. There are also a couple of rather suprisingly dark subplots going on in an otherwise dumbly fun comedy horror. This won't be for everyone Im sure so I'd recommend watching the trailer on Youtube first to see if its for you. Trust me, if the trailer doesnt scare you away with its penis cam then you'll be fine watching this movie."
